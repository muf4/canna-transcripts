[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 190 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Ross DeGefo and I thank
you guys again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots Band for letting me use their music.
[SPEAKER_03]: On my podcast, big shout out to Kat,
Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: My timing was way off on that intro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am high as giraffe pussy tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope nobody noticed until I pointed it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: About halfway through, I caught on what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smiled big because I know there are
people who mouth the intro word for word
[SPEAKER_04]: when it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, today that's fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike and I are hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for taking time out of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hanging out on a Sunday evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hot as fuck in Colorado today
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got super warm today and I took a lot
of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, let's push a 90 today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been smoking this Apothecary Extract
Lemon Jeffrey live batter and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: retarded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we say retarded?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am retarded because my mental
growth has been slowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am absolutely retarded right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can use the word appropriately at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said lemon candy and that was it
exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just brain farted the type of candy,
any lemon candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But lemon heads, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemon heads, but not like super strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just that nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost got a lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pez.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that's what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it doesn't have that harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: That a lemon head does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also got kind of a lemon sorbet,
like ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of a thing happening to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A sherbet sort of a thing going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice sweet lemon candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made me want to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me want to fucking sit in a chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash is a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the way that certain products
affect certain people differently based on
[SPEAKER_03]: our biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a neat thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite parts about cannabis is
that we are able to medicate ourselves
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriately and buy the products we
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: My least favorite thing about that,
though, is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: This lemon Jeffrey is not going to be
available forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was only so much of this produced
and I was only able to buy so much at this
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that the next time I go to
this dispensary, this shit will be gone
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've been hyping it up on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody I've smoked with smoked it with
is driven to the dispensary to buy some.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you see it in other industries a
little bit like they'll do a limited run
[SPEAKER_04]: shoe or a limited run album where it's
special for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the cannabis world, man,
beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting one off is that's just regular
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You show up at the dispensary and you're
like, oh, lemon Jeffrey batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get three grams of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go home and you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to stop by there Tuesday after
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That spot where the lemon Jeffrey is
filled with another product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, where did it go?
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was working the counter,
if someone said I really liked that,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd always make a point to be like,
well, we have 12 left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, you're buying one,
which means when you leave the store,
[SPEAKER_04]: there will be 11 sitting here and you're
welcome to come back and buy as many of
[SPEAKER_04]: those as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they're gone, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you come back after they're gone,
there's nothing I can do for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times it's the damn employees
buying up all the good shit, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, when it comes in, you've got to put it
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're the first one that sees what's
amazing and what's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get you sell it and then the
people come back and buy it from you
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, dude, I bought two grams of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need like seven more grams or give me my
limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get my limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, there was a dispensary
Mike and I would travel up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Vortex wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to take extra people with us so
that we could be like, here's your 250.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the limit in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just say what I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought I was full because they had
Durban poison and Vortex like all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had consistently had those two
strains and I loved them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure they thought I was flipping
it, but I was buying it and smoking every
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of it myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just the first group of people
they ran into that was consuming at that
[SPEAKER_04]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I was driving, it was in Denver
and I was driving 125 miles and sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: it'd be windy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Winter time and it would take me two and a
half hours to get to that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't do that more than once or
twice a month when you're working and have
[SPEAKER_03]: a life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm back and forth to Denver all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can cut a trip out or try to double
up what I'm doing in Denver for a trip,
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to go in there and try to buy my
limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually they're like seven
grams only.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, ah, so then I took Mike
and Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once I got my mom a medical
marijuana card and took her to all the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries with me, it's like,
come on, mommy, got to go help me buy a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was before we were.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was before dabs were so readily
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, hash is just abundant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go everywhere and get hash within
how long you think it takes to get out to
[SPEAKER_03]: three rivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about 15 minutes out that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three rivers is out in the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's east of town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're living along I-25, you're not
more than 20 minutes from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then out in Pueblo West, there are 10
dispensaries in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_03]: The spot, I didn't want to choose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, that's probably the most popular out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: 22 in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're about to get five more in the
city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five more in the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got one in town now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to get eight rec shops
in the city, but three of them are
[SPEAKER_04]: existing med shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't count those as new.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still eight more shops in the city
where you can buy a rec here in a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of months.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny that it has taken Pueblo so
long to come along to the shops in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since Mike and I actually had,
we were partners with another guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a guy who didn't really want to
be known too much who had a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hired me as a manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: One day he said, what do I need to do to
make this place better?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked him straight in the face and
I said, the best thing you could do would
[SPEAKER_03]: just be to go the fuck away.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is not somebody you need running a
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need Tom outside of the business
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there were so many moving parts to
that because he wanted to go live his
[SPEAKER_04]: dream on the mountain top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he did that, it became
perfection.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just a good old Southern boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it got hot in the building,
he would prop the back door open of the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got two security guards up front
with guns checking IDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got security between myself and the
front door, but the back door is propped
[SPEAKER_03]: wide open with a brick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, Tom, this defeats all of our
purpose here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or walk through the bedroom, pull it,
turn it on overhead fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it so hot in here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes through and turns on three
fans and we got to tell the lobby,
[SPEAKER_04]: all right, you guys got to hold up for
seven minutes while these fans slow down
[SPEAKER_04]: so that we can work our scales again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had that shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about 10 years ago now,
if you think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't quite that far back,
but nine, eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're at seven now.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because we've got kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's only been seven years,
but that's like thirty five thousand pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many harvests is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So much stuff has happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mike and I had that building running
like a fine tuned machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a superbly running machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were making a lot of money in that
dispensary and they came and shut us down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they finally have figured out how
to do the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shut us down because they weren't
properly zoned and hadn't made rules for
[SPEAKER_03]: us yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the only reason they could give us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They that shop got shut down officially
because we were violating zoning rules
[SPEAKER_04]: that they would officially pass like two
months later.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, we're super, super rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be a bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a normal Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still going to put out the long
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I need to put that together when
we're done doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to be a good week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a good week for the
fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to be a good week for podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listeners, thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's here to talk about some laws that
are coming up, some proposed laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk about the rules
here in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few people recently have asked me,
like, how many plants can I grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the rules?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to go over some rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Mike is the guy to call for
that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get that far, we got to do a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, tell people how people can follow
you, stalk you, track you, find you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find me on the interweb.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the interweb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them about your Twitter and tell them
about your Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check me out on Twitter at
Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on Facebook, it's Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check Mike out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Support him on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: He posts a lot of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an easy way to keep up on the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is very good at searching out the
truth and filtering out bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He won't share the bullshit with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I was at a gas station yesterday in
kind of a small town.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wearing my iRegenetics Colorado
cannabis t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to iRegenetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever does that is a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this girl at the counter, she was a
young girl, gullible young girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, hey, you're wearing a
cannabis shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's like a line of people in the
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, have you seen the things in
Denver and McDonald's with the bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: comes down to you and you can get high in
the bubble?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, yeah, that's,
I didn't, I didn't want to tell her like,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the onion, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she, she was pretty sure that that was
real.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, I want to go to Denver and
move to Denver just to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: People in little towns that they'll
believe anything, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: The level of misinformation is,
is greater than ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like people's willingness to
double check shit is lower than ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so many opportunities to check
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can call bullshit on so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, I've got a Mac book pro in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an iPhone to the right of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an old iPhone that's full of
pictures and still has internet access to
[SPEAKER_03]: the left of me there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there I've got YouTube on my phone
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got Explorer on my TV over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we can do all kinds of shit and
nobody wants to fact checked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to double check.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even the president is getting away
with shit like saying, well, my cousin
[SPEAKER_04]: told me, or I read it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what my advisors told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bigly true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what people are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I, you know, it's, it's
absolutely nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take two seconds and Google it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got an argument one day over,
does America have a national language?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I don't want to rehash any of that
mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it's a Google thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is just something that you can
check.
[SPEAKER_04]: There doesn't need to be a debate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just check.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, people just don't like taking
that extra step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Siri will tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you don't even have to know how
to type now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hold down a button and say all of
your questions into a device and either
[SPEAKER_03]: Alexa or Siri will tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even have to think anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for some reason, people just hate
doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when they're real passionate about
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically the reason Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws exists is because there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: group down here that's anti cannabis,
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were getting a lot of press and
kind of making a little name for
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, why don't I start a
troll page?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're Pueblo for positive impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started Pueblo for sensible cannabis
laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just started debunking there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would put up a post and I would just
go through it line by line and explain why
[SPEAKER_04]: that was total horse shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then take the two minutes it takes to
Google and pull the actual information
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite part is the way that they
reply to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They block Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they fucking can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just block him every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody supports Mike, that person
gets blocked too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right when I started doing this,
somebody told them that if they share my
[SPEAKER_04]: post, my page will be seen by more people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they screenshot instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so somewhere there's an anti pot kook
with thousands of screenshots of
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that I posted this page.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's kind of where that Facebook
page started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that you'll notice
if you try to check out any anti cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff online is their total inability to
give, they'll cite a study, they'll say a
[SPEAKER_04]: new study said this, but they won't tell
you which new study or who conducted it or
[SPEAKER_04]: where it was published.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even when they're citing an actual
number, it typically doesn't mean what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're saying it means.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even national anti cannabis
groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they get in trouble for a campaign
that they couldn't support their facts
[SPEAKER_03]: that they were posting?
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't necessarily get in trouble,
but they created a lot of really,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I honestly think it helped more
than it hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: They blanketed this city in big mailers
leading up to the election.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day you would get a new anti pot
nonsense mailer with your junk mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the closer we got to the election,
the more insane the argument became.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so even people that were like,
wow, did you read this, honey?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, you know, maybe we should rethink
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine out of 10 pot growers eat babies for
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by the time the election showed up,
people were, even when they were started
[SPEAKER_04]: out on the anti pot side, they were sick
of getting these in their mail every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people that were reading them were
finding just, I mean, even a quick glance
[SPEAKER_04]: at them by the end, it was like,
this is clearly ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like nine out of 10 doctors aren't out
advocating against legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we would have noticed that there's a
lot of doctors in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that seems like a parade amount worth
of no coverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a women's march and it was on
TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: When a whole bunch of people are pissed
about something, people tend to notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of given them too much
publicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fuck that group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out Mike's group.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what, I mean, that page is
all about, and just double check your
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, this is, it's more important now
than ever that the cannabis community get
[SPEAKER_04]: on the ball and not, I mean, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people don't have an extra 20 minutes
a day to be like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to double check that,
figure out what exactly is going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then post the actual information
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do all that work for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to come read it and share
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get information from Mike,
share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clicking share is free.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way you counter bad information is by
spreading good information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do with this show is just good
grow information so that more people grow
[SPEAKER_04]: better weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just don't want to know the
truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've said something and they don't want
to change their opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even after they're educated, some people
you just can't fix, but that's just some
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my big laugh of the week, did you catch
the story about the federal study
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana, how shitty it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's got mold in it and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I glanced over that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically what they're doing is taking the
plant, growing it out and then stuffing
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole fucking thing in a wood chip or
freeze drying it and calling it study
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just foul.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think the government would
pay a master grower to come read the
article?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to just call myself a master
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the title in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why this was the laugh of the week
is because when I saw that article,
[SPEAKER_04]: I chuckled and I was like, they need to be
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, come on down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, I want to go apply for the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go work at that fucking farm in
Mississippi and grow the dankest buds ever
[SPEAKER_03]: and then show them what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them up to speed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into a six month consult,
just show them how to run a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 420 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how long I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount of property they've got out
there is intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you watch some of the Sanjay Gupta
footage from his weed specials where they
[SPEAKER_04]: go out and film at the farm, they've got
all the parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just don't have a pot grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they don't have a pot grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a researcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who knows what kind of genetics
they've got, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got some Mexican bag seed that is
just a herm and they don't know what the
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck they're doing at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: No phenotype selection, no phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it honest to God looks like they're
taking the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be drying it before it goes
into the wood chipper, but it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: through a wood chipper, shredded stock,
seed material, leaf material.
[SPEAKER_03]: No joke, honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of every two or three days,
I run a wood chipper at the big grow to
[SPEAKER_03]: get rid of all the sticks and stalks and
dead leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just turns it into shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing there that could be tested
or useful at the end of all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're freeze drying it and then
they're sending it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There goes the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure exactly what happens when you
freeze dry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that to my cannabis, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but the stuff coming out of the
University of Mississippi Farm is all
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't see that story this week,
folks, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the farmers that respect
cannabis from beginning to the end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to anybody who's trying to do it
right and trying to do it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I'm doing shout outs, let's get to
this part.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to the dude and Scotty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike and I received personal shout outs on
the Dude Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike hasn't been here since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time he's joined me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of shout outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's like, shout out to Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bone Ellis gives me some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dude Grows gives me shout outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking loved hearing shout outs to my
crew on other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bo gives you shout outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Bone Ellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Split podcast and also huge,
super huge shout out to everybody at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dude Grows show has some loyal fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what their fans are called,
but as soon as they said shout out to
[SPEAKER_03]: Rasta Jeff, my phone started going,
like, bro, listen to the Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an email that says you should
listen to the Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, they just invited you to a party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, something just happened
because my phone just started blowing up
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was working in the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, who died?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got so many messages all at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've got a great following,
a great fan club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, thanks for all of the love from the
Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_03]: They reached out and invited us to their
little private party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do my best to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go dab out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take the Zoom H6 and two
microphones and I'm going to try to get
[SPEAKER_03]: those guys on a microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they're throwing a party and
they're not going to be focused on doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm showing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just bring a little small recording
device and a couple of mics and I'll just
[SPEAKER_03]: catch them when they're walking by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking to the mic for a couple of
seconds and then I'll try to catch a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff from there and piece it into a
show and then maybe they'll run it in
[SPEAKER_03]: their feed also.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I'm thinking,
hoping for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't wanted to go to a Candice event
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been too busy to even consider
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I heard that piece on the show,
I was like, I need to find out more and
[SPEAKER_04]: go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not like the social butterfly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go to a lot of the dab events.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't super social before I had a kid
and now I'm just too busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_03]: My kid's getting fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's old enough to be social.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can hang out and kick it and wait
till you get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at the like it's it's he's getting so
much more mobile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like the I always call it like
babies are suicidal that I can't climb off
[SPEAKER_04]: the side of this and survive the fall
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been learned yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's getting to the point where like
now it's really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he can make it from one side of the
house to the other in a heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm as tired as ever now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like 15 fatal fucking options
between you and that 15 feet that he just
[SPEAKER_04]: made a friend of ours just had a kid and I
saw a post like the fourth or fifth day.
[SPEAKER_04]: The kid was in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, wow, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just started cackling hysterically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I lost it for a couple of minutes and
just had a laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike's going to get a babysitter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going to come to the dude grows
party with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Lindsey and Chris have a project.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were invited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Traveling Stoner and Bobo Blastico.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have something that's happening that
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if they can make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the party goes late, they'll come,
but they have something else going on in
[SPEAKER_03]: the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their business to announce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let them drop that news on the show
and the time comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking really cool project they're
working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Devin, granny, granny, I reached out to
you a little bit, but I've been so busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gail, you've been invited to this party
with the dude grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like you to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the easiest way to reach out to
you, Gail.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's as busy as any three people I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude grows wants you to come to the
dude grows party.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a private party.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can go, let me know and I will set
everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been, our crew has been invited to
be judges for their cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get a judge's pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're invited to the event.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll be treated like fucking
rock stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were pretty excited to invite us
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thank you guys for the event.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, if you guys listen to the show,
um, I heard them say that they do listen
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they've built soil with me in
their ear before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's good to know that I love
that my, uh, the other podcasts are
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that there's no sense of
competition or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough podcasting and enough
listeners for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's enough soil that needs to be
mixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my favorite part is that I hear a lot
of people say, as soon as I run out of
[SPEAKER_03]: Rogan episodes, I listened to you and I'm
like, that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no qualms with being second to Joe
fucking Rogan because that's, if you look
[SPEAKER_04]: at my podcast list in my phone,
30 years working on this, you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it as a hobby for them and puts out
seriously nine hours a content a week
[SPEAKER_03]: minimum, sometimes 12 or 15 hours of
content.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of guys that do that that
I'm like, how do you, how can you possibly
[SPEAKER_04]: find the time?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to spend, I mean, half a week
in front of a microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's Joe Rogan and he's, he just says on
it, on it, on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they just paid his rent and then
he says, uh, stamps.com stamps.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they pay his rent and then he
goes, dollar shave club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they send them a Porsche.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how Joe Rogan fucking does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it's a whole different world,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your name's Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, I'm cool with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow from my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm all about seeing pictures of the
plants that people grew with the advice I
[SPEAKER_03]: gave them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Porsche that I get out of this,
honestly, package, lemon, Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_04]: like something special happened,
like in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love seeing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched you breed and I was sitting
around this table while we were smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon, Jeffrey, when it was still,
I don't remember what its serial number
[SPEAKER_04]: was, but when it was a, uh, basically a
judge's pack, here's your sample pack from
[SPEAKER_04]: this, you know, phenol hunt, which,
which three are the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when lemon Jeffrey was in the
hunt and here we are a couple of years
[SPEAKER_04]: later, seeing it grown by someone else,
totally unrelated to the crew in any way,
[SPEAKER_04]: processed by people, totally unrelated to
the crew in any way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just phenomenal product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, apothecary did a great job with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grow at elevated was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The product they showed me was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is neat to see it come, uh,
the lemon Jeffrey is in a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial facilities nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm impressed with that words out on that
one in the arise for sure arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A rise in New Mexico, like arises the
number one strain in New Mexico right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never wanted to go back to New Mexico
and then I saw a lab test and was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like now I've got a reason again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so if you are in Albuquerque,
New Mexico and you shop at organica,
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be more arise seeds very soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for the delay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was partially, it was all my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't partially my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I needed more packaging printed and my
printer that I was working with failed me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to go another route and it's been
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the people that came through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Kinko's dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I tried to support small business all
day long, but, uh, you gotta go where you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, they're going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's hard to have your friends
do work for you because when they fuck it
[SPEAKER_03]: up, you can't like not pay them because
they're your friends and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck up your friendship.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd, I've chosen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to large businesses and let them
do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time it's better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's something that's already in
their wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I know when I get ready for an email,
I'm going to someone that's in the circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll guide you through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know where to take you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of different things like
that where we know somebody who's just
[SPEAKER_04]: does it out of this world for a lot of
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just go to the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's known for doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friends at elevate at five 17 South
Tejon will take very good care of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need a new email, if you need a dab
rig, they don't even pay me anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did sponsor the show in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hooked me up with glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me good discounts at the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did some advertising for each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I was there yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I did not pay them to be nice to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were fucking super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me really good deals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sold us quality products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like shopping there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They play good music.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the elevate dolls, uh,
and turtle turtles there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a turtle is a cool fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's an elevate doll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and they've, they've hired a couple of
dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be all ladies there,
but they've hired a couple of dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the two dudes that were there
yesterday, super kind folk, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: Becca, the owner, super cool lady,
uh, five 17 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I would recommend you go buy
an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in Colorado Springs,
uh, the Colorado Springs area,
[SPEAKER_03]: go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me, listen to the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, give turtle a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out all the cool pennies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know that penny with the two
elephants on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could buy that and fucking send it to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing's fucking dope, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I want to buy that,
but I just couldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I haven't been in so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cause I don't like I've got other
stuff I need to spend money on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 20 is going to be awesome in my world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause so many things are wrapping up at
the beginning of April.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for me, it's not like a celebration
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a freedom thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many things will be checked off the do
list and the save up for list and the,
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't do that because of this list
by the, like the first week of April when
[SPEAKER_04]: that's cashed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to drop a bunch of money on
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got two items I've been looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost there also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two items, two toys for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always fun when you can buy expensive
toys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to buy them at the same time
because they kind of go together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to buy
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just upgrade my life a little bit by these
two new toys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we kind of, I kind of drifted from
telling granny that she should come to the
[SPEAKER_03]: dude grows party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, granny, you've been invited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be judges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we get a judge's pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Mike came over because we wanted to
talk about some rules and some laws that
[SPEAKER_03]: are happening in college.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are new proposed laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's SB 12 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is they are trying to limit the plant
count to 16 plants per household unless
[SPEAKER_03]: you are in an agricultural area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're zoned ag land special.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're at anything that's zoned
residential, which is the majority of
[SPEAKER_04]: housing in Colorado period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a medical marijuana patient
and you've got a plant count for 24 count
[SPEAKER_03]: for 24 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you can have 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 is the 16 is the, the new proposed
statewide limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and this bill already made it through
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The house of representatives in Colorado,
it started out as a 12 plant limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, after like nine and a half hours of
testimony, they upped it to 16 and dropped
[SPEAKER_04]: the penalties for breaking these rules
from felony to misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, uh, the bill made it through
another committee and is now sitting in
[SPEAKER_04]: front of the Colorado Senate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so it could get changed some more in
the Senate before it heads to the
[SPEAKER_04]: governor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the governor's excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants this limit bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's a beer guy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the only reason, um,
extended plant counts became the
[SPEAKER_04]: scapegoat, um, for marijuana regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to kind of interrupt you just a
little bit here, but I apologize for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to explain to everybody what
an extended plant count is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the state of Colorado, we are allowed
to grow six plants as an adult,
[SPEAKER_03]: as an adult 21 or over, you're allowed to
grow six plants of recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get a medical marijuana card,
the original rule was that you were
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the default limit is six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you have a debilitating condition
that the doctor feels you require more
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis or your delivery system requires
more cannabis to treat the conditions you
[SPEAKER_03]: were treating for, they could write you
what's called an extended plant count,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would allow you to grow more plants
to produce the amount of medicine that you
[SPEAKER_03]: need to take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's an extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, these extended plant counts are now
being scrutinized and they're being kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of vetoed by other rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a whole lot of history and
other rules and stuff going on that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of led to the practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Colorado, extended plant counts,
basically 99 was the big biggest card
[SPEAKER_04]: that, um, that anybody's written in the
last several years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, there were a couple of
doctors that were doing 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and for the most, I mean, the numbers
of people with cards that are over,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, 24 was, I mean, it was like 25 people
across the state, the tiny amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: My number has dwindled down and I've got a
good relationship with my doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, I could walk in and get a
good number.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now my number is not as impressive as
it used to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two, two years before this last visit,
my, my two visits or so, the last visit,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the one before that, the one
before that, the earliest two,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I walked in, he was like,
you want your normal count?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gave me the extended plant count I had
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't bat an eyelash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: His dogs farted in the office a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody that's gone to that doctor
knows who I'm talking about too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half the people in Pueblo and Springs have
been to this doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: He brings his fucking dogs and they fart
in the office and it smells like death.
[SPEAKER_04]: Death.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, I mean, it wasn't the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, here's your extended plant
count.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a nice life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll see you in a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, unless you have an issue before,
you know, your cards up.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I went in this last time,
it was, I do six cards, six count cards
[SPEAKER_04]: period.
[SPEAKER_04]: End of conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're paranoid now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they don't want to lose their
licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason they're doing this is like,
I was starting to say, extended plant
[SPEAKER_04]: counts and caregivers became the scapegoat
a couple of years back when cops started
[SPEAKER_04]: showing up to, um, grows where it was just
like a, an outside horse fenced area with
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 plants in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from time to time they would show up
to one that was real egregious with
[SPEAKER_04]: paperwork or that had paperwork saying
that the overall plant count is legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the cops started going to the
press.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying, you know, we're running into
cartels who are using the extended plant
[SPEAKER_04]: count and caregiver rules in Colorado is
cover to produce huge amounts of illegal
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they would point to busts of
cartel home grows where they had 2000,
[SPEAKER_04]: 3000, 5,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one has nothing to do with the
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: The illegal growers are illegal growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've always been illegal growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how like 40 to 60% of a $60 billion
national market gets produced in
[SPEAKER_04]: basements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and they were attempting to blame all
of that on our caregivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of the Chris Berkowitz story,
um, several years ago, caregivers do not
[SPEAKER_04]: do interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, not so much the last six months or
so, but, uh, for the last several years,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would get a couple of calls a month from
reporters every time the new caregiver
[SPEAKER_04]: bill would go through the legislature,
trying to get me to set them up with a
[SPEAKER_04]: caregiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's your caregiver?
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you've got a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know, you know, caregivers,
please put us into contact with these
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer was no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'd reach out to care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody I know that's a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: We developed a relationship with that
reporter and she would call me first and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, Hey, will you be on camera?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say, Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she would call you and be like,
have your caregiver come?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be like, like, thanks Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good cover, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caregivers don't do interviews because
when caregivers do interviews,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the local law enforcement,
wherever they live shows up and gives them
[SPEAKER_04]: hell because the interviewer only wants to
know about how much you can produce and
[SPEAKER_04]: how you're able to survive and make a
living.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you clearly spending 50 hours a week
doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the cops take one look at that and
they're like, we should rate him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's clearly illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they show up and they make your life
hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: They trash the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if you're lucky, and you've got
all your paperwork, um, your whole
[SPEAKER_04]: situation is still destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in minimum, you've got a huge legal
hassle, a couple of days, some clean up
[SPEAKER_04]: court, and then several days cleaning up
the mess they made, tearing your shit
[SPEAKER_04]: apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they shot your dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your dog's been shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So caregivers just don't do interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: And part, part of that has led to,
um, very few people stand up and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you pass this new rule, you're
proposing three of my patients are going
[SPEAKER_04]: to die.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a lot of caregivers, that's the
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're treating someone with cancer or
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and if they're no longer able to do
what they've been doing legally for years,
[SPEAKER_04]: their patients are screwed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, the rules that they're proposing
will end caregiving period in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, 16 plants only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only half in bloom at one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't enough to provide for more than one
or two people, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's barely enough to provide for one
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're talking about oils and things of
that nature.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, Doug wouldn't survive on these
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to, it would be, I'll have to
decide who's caregiver I would want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: if I even chose to continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably take care of Doug.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you dropped everyone else, including
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be able to, I would be able to
grow for myself and Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would be about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you'd be able to cover both
of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know I could, uh, because I know
how to produce weight with small numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: in small spaces, but the average person is
going to struggle doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, see, and that's where that's part of
the, the, the argument that gets lost in a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of the testimony is when you hear,
okay, there's a caregiver living in a
[SPEAKER_04]: residential house with 99 plant count.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's their six patients combined add
up to 99, uh, or their five patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves, sorry, combined add up to 99.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, people picture 99 Volkswagen bus size
plants in full harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they don't realize is that
immediately off the top, you cut that 99
[SPEAKER_04]: and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now you've got 44 in bloom,
45 in veg or 45 in one and 44 in the
[SPEAKER_04]: other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'm sorry, 55.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to let you keep,
I was taking a drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just let it slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd keep something weird on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm not crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It went, usually it lights up two dots
when I'm talking and it went up to like
[SPEAKER_04]: five.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my brain did the stoner thing that
was like, did you do something weird or
[SPEAKER_04]: did the light do something?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of lost my train of thought
while I was trying to do math plus lemon
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeffrey jabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cut your plant count in half is all
you're allowed to flower out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you're a caregiver carrying
for five people and yourself, those five
[SPEAKER_04]: people's conditions are going to require
different strains, um, which require
[SPEAKER_04]: different mother plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden you're in a situation
where you're harvesting nine plants at a
[SPEAKER_04]: time, seven plants at a time, maybe 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one way that medical users produce
quick amounts of medicine is to put a four
[SPEAKER_03]: by four tray with 64 Rockwell cubes and a
tiny, tiny plant and veg it for like two
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks and flip it flower for 60 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then each one of those produces five
to 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's approximately a pound of weed is
your goal there, but you've got 64 plants
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as you can, but you've got to do 64
plants to make that even a viable option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're not going to pull as much
weight as an experienced grower is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I could pull two pounds with four
plants under one light.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I do it my method, it's just all about
how your timing works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just sucks that people that are
doing this, like a small hydro setup,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to have to change everything
because of a bunch of stupid fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you listen to the testimony of
the people that are really in support of
[SPEAKER_04]: this bill, they say things like every
plant equals a pound of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish, um, or two or three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, well, maybe outdoors,
like if you did some stuff and had some
[SPEAKER_04]: talent and a couple of other things,
but like five of those are illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're looking at a couple ounces
for like a really nice big plant indoors,
[SPEAKER_04]: not a couple pounds.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the whole conversation that's
taking place at the state level here is
[SPEAKER_04]: twisted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you can hop online and people like
it's, this is legislation that's taking
[SPEAKER_04]: place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's broadcast, it's recorded,
it's posted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can listen to the testimony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, it's disturbing those during
this bill when it was in the, it's first
[SPEAKER_04]: hearing, um, a little girl, girl and her
father testify.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cute before when the
committee's like, whoever wants to go
[SPEAKER_04]: first, the dad's like, please let my
daughter go first and then judge her
[SPEAKER_04]: independently from me because like I'm
military and I'm can be harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want you to misjudge my
daughter cause I'm a douche.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the, the wrap up of the daughter's
testimony is this rule forces my family to
[SPEAKER_04]: choose between who lives me or my dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I'm a dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that hit me like right in the gut,
like, oh, and then, um, like two minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: later, while the dad's testifying,
one of the committee members is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys live on ag land.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, yeah, you know,
we're, we're here to testify that there
[SPEAKER_04]: are a lot of people in Colorado like us,
that this is going to harm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the committee member goes,
but it won't harm you too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't really have to choose which
one of you dies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's not really a choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are going to have to make like
other families.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not you two personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the dad's like, no, you know,
we live on agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're homesteaders.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do our own meat, veggies, we grow and
produce everything ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't give a shit about them at
that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, now we can ignore everything
you two have said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you have a different zip code than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because yeah, because that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The land you happen to reside on is zoned
agricultural.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these rules won't necessarily
affect you until you try to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since we are allowed to grow six plants
as a recreational smoker, and how much is
[SPEAKER_03]: a recreational smoker allowed to possess
cannabis wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not know that rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this weird open ended loophole
where recreational wise, you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep your whole harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the questions we left with medical
marijuana is what you can do with the
[SPEAKER_04]: excess.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get pulled over, how much can I have
in my car?
[SPEAKER_04]: An ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if you're honest and not to even
taunt anybody, you guys, if you get caught
[SPEAKER_03]: with weed in Colorado and you don't have a
fucking pound exposed, you can have your
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you got, they don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't be a dickhead about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be doing the crack your window
to DUI checkpoint constitutional,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ruin this cop's 45 minutes
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like, your eyes are glazed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been eating donuts?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be really fucking stupid for
the cop to care about your two and a half
[SPEAKER_04]: bags of weed instead of your one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a cop walk up to my car and I am
good at getting pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done an episode about how to get
pulled over properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I rolled down my window all the way before
that cop got anywhere near my car and had
[SPEAKER_03]: both hands up on the steering wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was probably 15 feet away from me and
he goes, sir, do you have any marijuana in
[SPEAKER_03]: there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yes, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know for sure, but I was like,
yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my personal bag of weed in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work at a grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were in other states, there's enough
marijuana ground into the carpet in my
[SPEAKER_04]: floor pads for the answer to need to be
yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then his answer was, well, it smells
pretty strong in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I just grabbed my badge because I had
my marijuana enforcement division badge
[SPEAKER_03]: attached to my shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just go, sir, I work in a grow and I
smell strong every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: He relaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, oh, my daughter works in a grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: He became friendly and did not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going 92.
[SPEAKER_03]: He clocked me at 92 and a 75 and didn't
give me a ticket because I told him I had
[SPEAKER_03]: weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you start off friendly and honest,
the interaction goes a different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Colorado, like the, oh my God,
I've got weed on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: None of that needs to exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens for a couple of seconds still.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from that school when I used to have
more weed than I care to admit that was in
[SPEAKER_03]: the car and I shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been pulled over and gotten away with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to see the red and blues,
hit the turn signal to let them know that
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to stop as soon as it was safe
and then do the inventory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything in the glove box?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything in the passenger seat?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quick time to do a PSA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't put illegal shit in your glove box.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of people do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear a lot about people doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I see it on TV or in the
movies, I chuckle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops are behind you, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You start shitting your pants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing what Mike does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, what's in the car?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in the car?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do I have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that cop gets there, he's going to
say, license, registration, proof of
[SPEAKER_03]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: License is in your pocket in your wallet,
probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess where your registration and proof of
insurance are?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the fucking glove box where you've got
the gun and the dope hidden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop doing that stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now your license and insurance smells like
the dang bag of weed you just threw on top
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to reach in there and fish out
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be all shaky reaching out
your license and insurance card,
[SPEAKER_03]: that Geico card.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to fish that out without letting
that baggie fall out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that shit somewhere else, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we get pulled over here, we just say,
yes, officer, there's weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got pulled over at lunch one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were four of us in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on our way back and I did the same
thing you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of held up my badge and was like,
we're on our way back from lunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cop scans through the car and was
like, oh, go to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were four idiots out here
causing trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're four employees eating in a parking
lot real quick before you hurry back to
[SPEAKER_04]: your job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a nice rest of your shift,
fellas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't bat an eyelash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: All four of us working at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy James is from Georgia and he got
pulled over the other morning because he
[SPEAKER_03]: had a brake light out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I passed him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh fuck, James is going to be
late.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, man, how was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, cops, you're just fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be fucking up to get
pulled over in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just pulled him over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down here in Pueblo, it's a little like...
It was state patrol that got him,
no.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just pulled him over because one of
his brake lights was out and it was 630 in
[SPEAKER_03]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on our way to work early in the
morning and they just pulled him over to
[SPEAKER_03]: tell him, hey, you got a brake light out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to get hassled a bunch when I was a
teenager further north, but not since I
[SPEAKER_04]: moved here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could kind of do whatever you want in
this town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go for 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little bit about the city and
county of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one tiny little caveat to these
state rules that I want to add.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They built in a loophole to kind of make
it mildly more palatable, and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: bullshit and I'll go into why in a second,
but the little loophole they built in is
[SPEAKER_04]: several cities and counties have already
passed home-grow limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if an area has already passed a
limit, I can't remember if the state bill
[SPEAKER_04]: says it automatically supersedes or that
area is allowed to decide if it wants to
[SPEAKER_04]: have their previous rules supersede the
state rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so your area, if it wants to,
can pass a much higher plant count limit,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is much more likely, like Denver and
several other places have already done,
[SPEAKER_04]: they've already passed a 12 plant limit
and they want to keep it, even though the
[SPEAKER_04]: state limit is going to be 18.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's that one little kind of
loophole spot, but I guarantee no area in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado is going to go after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would make you to... I mean,
it's just to be the only county in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado that allows 40.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody will move there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sloppy will pack up the day they say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, if I owned Ag Land in Colorado,
I'd be all over Craigslist right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that everybody that lives in
Colorado that is over 21, if you have got
[SPEAKER_03]: five by five square extra feet in your
house, in your life, in your backyard,
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever, grow six plants of cannabis,
do the best you can, grow six plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: get six clones from somebody from a
dispensary, get some seeds, grow that
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, even if you do not consume
cannabis, even if you don't care about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, there is a medical marijuana
patient out there that is about to get
[SPEAKER_03]: fucked out of their caregiver,
that's not going to have plants to grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: that are grown for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: A caregiver's job is to provide safe
quality cannabis to their patient and
[SPEAKER_03]: their patient relies on them and trusts
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that when Mike gets cannabis from
his caregiver, he knows it wasn't sprayed
[SPEAKER_03]: with anything funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't fed anything funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was trimmed properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not moldy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that may have had a problem got
destroyed and thrown away and was not
[SPEAKER_03]: passed off as used.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a super reactive plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like having a pet hamster.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's giving you something fun and new
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get to take this medical
marijuana product to a sick person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And make them so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they smoke it, you get to watch,
I've got a friend who has, he's not well
[SPEAKER_03]: in his head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes he has bad days and he'd be
like, dude, bring me something different
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see it on his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got road rage.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like he doesn't drive,
but he looks like he just was in traffic
[SPEAKER_03]: for seven hours trying to fucking fight
Denver traffic going north in the
[SPEAKER_03]: southbound lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll fucking take a couple of
dabs with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he relaxes and he goes, man,
thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go do stuff now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we weren't able to do that for
people, but when you get to see that
[SPEAKER_03]: happen, you understand why and how
important this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to the reasons rules like
this are getting proposed and pushed,
[SPEAKER_04]: they, I mean, during the testimony for
this one in particular, um, one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: legislature members actually, that's a
torch by the way listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my dad torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one of the legislatures actually stops
the guy testifying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like, wait, any plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the guy's like, if you have more
than one or two house plants in your home,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're probably generating toxic mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, cause that's basically when they,
they go after caregivers in home grows,
[SPEAKER_04]: they list every problem that you typically
see with the most egregious black market
[SPEAKER_04]: production grows houses, gutted power,
stolen, uh, fertilizers and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dumped on the back lawn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, diesel fuel spew spilled on the
neighborhood children.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a trap house grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not a medical marijuana caregiver
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a trap house grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's no mold in my caregivers grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no stolen power feeding my
caregivers grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, all of this is a legal behavior
symptom and they're trying to attribute it
[SPEAKER_04]: to anyone attempting to grow any kind of
house plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, even if it wasn't cannabis that you
were trying to grow in your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of the legislatures,
legislators is like, wait a second,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got like two dozen house plants and
you can kind of see her we're doing the,
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to count them in her head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, well, I fill up the picture and I do
this room in that room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, I've got a bunch of house
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mean my house is full of mold?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, well, that really depends
how you take care of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could kind of see the mood change
when it was like, Oh bro, you dropped the
[SPEAKER_04]: bullshit for just a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you let reality slip out for just a
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's all about how you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're willing to do it, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have stolen power.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have poison sprayed on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have neighbors complaining about
the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have teenagers and thugs from
Florida breaking into your room.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no traffic coming and going.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nobody parked in front of the
house with the music playing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've never had to threaten your neighbor
to not say anything about something they
[SPEAKER_04]: saw that shouldn't have been like,
none of that's happened here because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not a black market production facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's, that's trap house behavior.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they think they're going to solve all
this by, by passing a plant count.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't catch them stealing power.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't catch them destroying rental
houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't catch them selling the product
on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't catch them driving it across
state lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't catch them depositing the money
in the bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not following the rules for any of
that behavior.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think you're going to solve all
this with that plant count rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only people this will affect are the
people who are desperately doing
[SPEAKER_04]: everything they can to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the people these rules were
passed for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it even worth having a medical card
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've had the medical card,
um, for two reasons the entire time I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been allowed to have one, one,
because I'm injured and I use cannabis to
[SPEAKER_04]: treat my pain and two, because it provides
me significant additional legal
[SPEAKER_04]: protections.
All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I like it because I can shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that's a huge benefit too,
but I don't shop that much, but anytime,
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere I can stop and shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I saw that this apothecary lemon
Jeff was on sale and I was able to get
[SPEAKER_03]: that without the card.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have been fucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've been stranded in Springs before I
had a car breakdown in Springs on two
[SPEAKER_04]: different occasions.
[SPEAKER_04]: In both times I was like medical card in
the wallet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado Springs does not have any
recreational cannabis stores, medical
[SPEAKER_03]: only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, when I go visit my mom up in
Denver, the place, uh, half a block from
[SPEAKER_04]: her house is, uh, meds, not only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I pull up to her and her house
and I'm like, man, today was stressful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't bring anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The med shops are so much cheaper too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those extra legal protections that I
really like, um, I actually like some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the things they're doing rec over what
some of the things they're doing medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: The testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the testing is exactly what I was kind
of hinting at, but they're bringing that
[SPEAKER_04]: back into, they're bringing those rules
in, in the line with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see a lab test on this lemon
Jeffrey, but there is not one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just a disclaimer that when it shows
up, it'll be varied by 15%.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of bullshit is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys in Colorado, they're allowed to
be 15% plus or minus on the THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is whack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is completely whack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new rule that passed recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything says plus or minus 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not sure if you just bought a 10
or a 25 and cannabis usually ranges from
[SPEAKER_03]: about 20 and right now it's somewhere
between 17 and 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 is really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so a 15% variance, you could get zero
if you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have 2% cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you read 15% on a label, that could be
a zero or that could be a 30 and that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of swings a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if I roll up a joint and I'm a newb
and I can't judge potency by
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics that aren't on the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I smoke half this joint or do I smoke
the whole joint?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you light that up, who knows where
you're going.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's zero, you're going to get to the
end of it and be confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love smoking joints at concerts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can smoke all of your weed at a concert
and not get high cause I'm a dabber and
[SPEAKER_03]: people just look at me like what is wrong
with the Terminator over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He smoked all the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a dab to get where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like shows where there's a lot of joints
moving because you never know what's
[SPEAKER_04]: coming through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the last time I was in line at Red
Rocks, the kid next to me, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a guy running up and down the,
the entrance selling loose joints out of
[SPEAKER_04]: an Altoids 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second time he shouldered between
me and the guy next to me, the guy next to
[SPEAKER_04]: me chuckled.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like skinny little bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought he was talking about the
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of chuckled cause it was this
really skinny white kid in a polo shirt,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, in khaki shorts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, accurate description.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he pulls out a joint that's the
thick around is my thumb and like half as
[SPEAKER_04]: long as my forearm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, this is a real joint,
but I'd charge more than $5.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just start chuckling.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lights it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as that goes out, maybe 15 minutes
later, someone else that was right in our
[SPEAKER_04]: vicinity that got hit a couple of times
was like, I got next pulls out an okay
[SPEAKER_04]: size joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's well rolled lights it
up and before it can get to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Oh, I'm good, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm going to pretend like I'm too
high for a minute and just pass this
[SPEAKER_04]: quietly to my left and let someone else
hit this mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smell it from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like it's all dog hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, uh, at, uh, at red rocks in 96
seeing fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I don't know how you remember
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't the point of seeing fish that you'll
never be able to remember you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's, that's what's weird is I used
to, I've seen more fish shows not on drugs
[SPEAKER_03]: than I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have on drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I do, I like to do drugs when
there's nothing else to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to remember fish concerts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like being, when you're, when you
take out, when you're super drunk at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bar, I don't drink anymore, but when
you're super drunk at the bar and you get
[SPEAKER_03]: that super hot girl to come home with you
and you wake up next to her and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I wonder if that was any fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, God damn, that was probably a
good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so that's, that's why I kind of,
I don't do a lot of drugs at fish shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: The story I'm about to tell, uh,
attributes to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we pulled out some joints,
me and my buddy, Greg, we pulled out some,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was four 20 and we're in line at the
fish show and we pulled out some joints to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy next to me goes, I trade you
some acid for a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, well, fuck yeah,
we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and Greg each gave this guy a joint and
he gave us one hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, one should be cool for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we split it in half and ate that hit
acid, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it was one of the best acid trips of
my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, red rocks, uh, during, so they do a
song called space Odyssey, 2001 during
[SPEAKER_03]: that song, red rocks lifted up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it pivoted around the drummer and
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like spinning around the drummer
was the axis, but somehow I was also,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and it was spinning and we lifted off
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, you know how red rocks,
when you're looking at the stage,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just orange with lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the big speaker stacks on each
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just turned into a big orange blur
with nine squares on either side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't tell what anything was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy, Greg tapped me on the
shoulder and he goes, you should drink
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this water, you're fucking
tripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you are so correct right
now, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I drank some of that water and ate a
rice crispy treat and sat down for a few
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, everything kind of came back
together because they went into it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: down with disease and it's ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's some of my favorite music.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it brought me back, but they pulled
out a joint and this dude's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll treat you acid for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had no idea what we fucking got
ourselves into do that acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tripped for like 15 hours off a half a
hit each.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, one of my friends in college,
when not whenever red rocks would come up,
[SPEAKER_04]: he would remember mumble, don't eat the
brownies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not sure if she still goes,
but there used to be a, um, a chocolate
[SPEAKER_04]: covered mushroom lady and every now and
then they were in brownies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I guess someone else handed him
one and he had a really fun afternoon at
[SPEAKER_04]: red rocks and just kind of learned his
lesson the hard way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to woke shows, be careful with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really quickly, we said we were going
to talk about Pueblo and we've totally
[SPEAKER_03]: skipped Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, we bore the fuck out of people
when we talk about Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try not to do too localized stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were basically all Colorado this
episode, but we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Pueblo County is just on the outskirts
of where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it affects us heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Pueblo County and their
plant counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, separate rules for the city and
County, uh, the County passed a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: count limit of 18 a while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 plants in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and that's any, um, that's,
I think that's period per piece of
[SPEAKER_04]: property.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not a licensed marijuana
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm, I'm relatively sure that includes
ag land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then in the city, uh, they,
uh, I actually fought tooth and nail for
[SPEAKER_04]: this when it was going through,
they wanted a limit of nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I was able to convince the people
that were writing these rules that passing
[SPEAKER_04]: a plant cap limit would cause problems and
headaches because it's the city getting in
[SPEAKER_04]: between patients and doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there were several other clever ways
of limiting, um, the size and scope of a
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I got them to do a square foot
limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I wanted a lot more than a hundred
feet, a hundred square feet, cause it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really not that much space.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 10 by 10 room inside the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're limited to a hundred square feet of
grow space in any one home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you can apply, uh, if you've got
like an, uh, a garage that's got a
[SPEAKER_04]: foundation, four walls and a roof,
you can go to the city and apply for a
[SPEAKER_04]: variance allowing you to do like 150 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in that out building, but you have to
jump through an extra little hoop or two
[SPEAKER_04]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what if you've got, what if your room
that you're trying to grow, you get a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if your room you're trying to grow in
is 10 feet by 11 feet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need to just tape off that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to modify, um, existing
structures to make it work, but that's all
[SPEAKER_04]: the space you're allowed to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, honestly, I haven't heard of a single
person in the city that it's gotten busted
[SPEAKER_04]: where a small, like you were, you know,
you were using 110 square feet,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that have had trouble with law
enforcement here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and in the city and county right now,
it's, uh, zoning rules that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: violating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you get a municipal court ticket,
like you painted a wildly inappropriate
[SPEAKER_04]: slogan across the front of your house or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's not like a felony or a
misdemeanor or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a civil infraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that's part of the reason a lot of
local government people that have passed
[SPEAKER_04]: rules like this are pushing for a
statewide rule because the statewide rule,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were pushing for felony, um,
and ended up so far, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: misdemeanor if you break these rules now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a bit heavier stick to, to threaten
people with if they break the plant cap
[SPEAKER_04]: rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, in the city, the only people that
have been busted were way above,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, what their limits were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the city, you can have as many
plants as you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to keep them in that 10 by
10 area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, how you go about that, like,
I'm sure there's some people that have
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten real creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say how tall that area.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how many plants you can cram into that
or how many lights you can cram into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I'm sure there's some dude who's
built a cube of gavitas.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing in layers, you got to do shelves
shelving, like small plants on a little
[SPEAKER_03]: six inch shelf, taller on a 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a hundred square foot period.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're talking about having a veg space
and a bloom space, now you've got a four
[SPEAKER_04]: by four and a six by six or two,
five by fives and things get ugly quick.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 10 by five and two, five by fives is the
way to go.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mom's veg flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this state rule passes, Pueblo city and
county would have the option of keeping
[SPEAKER_04]: those limits or adopting the statewide
just vague limit of 18.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so that would be up to each little
local jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: When all is said and done, if this passes,
the good news is, is basically every year
[SPEAKER_04]: for the last seven years, um, the
legislature has had at least one effort
[SPEAKER_04]: going after caregivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and every single one of them has
failed every single one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they've attacked this problem a couple
of different ways over the last two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, we mentioned they're going
after the doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's not going to be anyone in
the state that has a 99 plant count card
[SPEAKER_04]: here, um, come shit, probably September.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, caregivers are, uh, um, the registry
is now man statewide caregiver registry is
[SPEAKER_04]: now mandatory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you gotta hop online and register.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, right now, if you're a caregiver and
you're following your plant limit,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, your only rules, you've got to follow
our basic building code.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your electrical has to be up to code.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, you can't be stealing power.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be dumping stuff in the lawn,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, if they pass these rules,
a lot of the people who are currently
[SPEAKER_04]: legally allowed to grow larger amounts
and, and for the most part, these are the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are giving away, um,
huge amounts of CBD oil to poor families
[SPEAKER_04]: with the kids with the face syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, one of the things a lot of the,
the kids with that are being treated with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, their illness is bankrupt
families quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, things like epilepsy, DeVay syndrome,
cancer, leukemia, uh, autism.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not cheap to treat.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not the appointments needed to
diagnose and aren't right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving to Colorado isn't cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave finding a new job, relocating,
um, all of the things these families go
[SPEAKER_04]: through to get here are all incredibly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they get here, um, several of
them have been really lucky to find
[SPEAKER_04]: caregivers who are willing to produce,
uh, grow large numbers of plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is risky just because it's a
valuable commodity, um, depending on where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're standing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, grow large numbers of plants,
refine it down into a consistent dosable
[SPEAKER_04]: product, like an oil or a pill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and then they give it to these
families at little to no cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oftentimes the people with the really big
counts, cause there's like five of them in
[SPEAKER_04]: the state, um, they're both bulletproof as
far as, as any sort of jury of their peers
[SPEAKER_04]: is concerned because of how they operate
and who they care for.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with these new rules, their legal
right to operate like they have been for
[SPEAKER_04]: years is gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, which means it doesn't matter who
they're treating.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if 12, 12 of their peers agrees that
they should be able to do this to save
[SPEAKER_04]: that kid's life, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're breaking the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a felon now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that many little kids that have to
have seizures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch them Twitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mike, we've been going for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was supposed to be a bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're spoiling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're spoiling the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's turn off the mics and take some dabs
and chill out for a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that about an hour before I headed
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody sent me a tweet that,
uh, I like it when you ramble and I smiled
[SPEAKER_04]: real big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember who it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: This fan on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to that Twitter follower.

[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys got questions and those
I've got three questions about how to get
[SPEAKER_04]: my crop to be better this year.

Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Email me all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's an outdoor question, I will get it

I will find the proper channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get those people on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love listener generated content.

hitting my target.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting the listeners the info that
they need.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love doing that.
