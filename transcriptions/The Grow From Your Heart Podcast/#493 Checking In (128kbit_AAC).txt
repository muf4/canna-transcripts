[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part of the night right now is
that you're dancing to music that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm always doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What song are you dancing to, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly, I just got to beat my heart,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just moving over there,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just try to be excited for
the things you like doing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 492 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me once
again is Tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will cough right into the
microphone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A professional way to start a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys cannot tell, we are smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint still hasn't dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get stoned off the flowers you do
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I like, I'm jealous of you
getting to like taste everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like a fun, like connoisseur
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, because I don't drink, I don't have
like that microbrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's introduce the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they're listening to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 492.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting stoned, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's smoking flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is smoking, did you say that's AK
47?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually smoked some of that flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was well grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was well cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could have been trimmed a little tiny bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, while I'm thinking about it,
shout out to Dirtman Dan for the
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me these little, I don't know what
they're called, but they're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: little thumb scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little condom that goes on
your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a little, like a thumbnail,
like a metal thumbnail on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's for trimming weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could probably trim a lot of other
things, but it makes, if you're a hand
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmer and you just trim, if you dry trim
weed, that's already kind of dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a beautiful method for using
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly how I'll use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be, it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the company that makes them
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're over there in a package.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent them to me as a Christmas present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really cool of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly how they'll be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ADD is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is good in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weed could have been trimmed a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well-baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to describe the flavors and
aromas of your flour or are you even into
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have such a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I started asking, I was like,
Clint's not really a descriptive kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: guy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taste like an overall taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say bubblegummy and slightly
fruity?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to try it again real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me one moment, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you opened the jar of it when
you got here, it smelled bubblegummy and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that smells pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hit it, that bubblegum and fruit
flavor came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it was dried and cured
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever grew that, big shout out to the
chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the drying and curing on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a broken branch off of a friend's
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until they broke the branch, they did a
pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it happens when you get some heavy
buds going up there and you don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: trellising set up well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes branches break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm just talking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's picking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking on the Sour Best Lemons Full
Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of S-B-S-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what S-B-S-E stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have done some research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's S-B-S-E and Lemon Tree Northern
Lights on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as lemons,
lemons and more lemons is what the package
[SPEAKER_00]: says.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's been described as.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely fucking lemony,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tipping the package over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take photos of my concentrates
and then I share them to my social media
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only put them on my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put them in my Instagram post
because Instagram can be haters when I
[SPEAKER_00]: post photos of concentrates and they'll
take the picture down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it up in the story and it stays for
24 hours and it disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my good friends at Green Dot Labs,
they repost it so it gets to be seen by a
[SPEAKER_00]: few more folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do post the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was taking a photo of this,
I noticed there are so many turps in this
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a four gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's two and a half grams of turps
minus the quarter gram of turps that
[SPEAKER_00]: poured out onto my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it was coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of turp sauce on my
finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little maple syrup,
a little pancake syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the color, but the consistency of
maybe some honey or some maple syrup on my
[SPEAKER_00]: finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I panicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to take a picture of it
because it was really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, that's really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just turp dripping off my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to drip onto the table and or
the floor and I didn't want that to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I licked it off my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that was a good or bad
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did say that was the first time you've
ever done that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my memory, that's the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have had some lemon Jeffrey turps in
a smaller dose in that manner,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was a nice little full.
[SPEAKER_00]: My tongue had a weird sensation for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like my tongue was kind of tingly
and kind of vibratey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it tasted like lemons and lemons and
more lemons also tasted like the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very pine tree in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like if you took me, there's a
national forest 40 minutes south of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took me there and you're like,
breathe in, that's what my mouth tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: like, just foresty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious, but that was a very
unique thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure because I didn't take two fat
dabs of the sour best lemons and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of puffs off that bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high and I don't know if I got extra
high from the part that I put on my tongue
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, but I am certainly high as shit
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you're ingesting it in a
different way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're just getting it sublingually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe is that when it goes straight into
your tongue like that, it was mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was turpadelic on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasted for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so turpy that like it was spicy
lemons and I don't know if that makes any
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, but the sour best lemons full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract has me rambling like a fucking
fool so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious concentrate on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says 71.93% THC and non-detectable CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, good job to our friends at green dot
labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what do we do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we never did the seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now add this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brought to you by our friends at
seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to send people to seeds here now to
go get their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need new seeds in your garden,
regular feminized auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them at seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you find them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint seats now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look lost in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.

[SPEAKER_00]: are just going more slowly and slowly as
time goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fun, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing you like a different mode is,

[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want to send a thank you to
everybody who has sent me some love and
[SPEAKER_00]: some support and some words of

[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, I did have to break
bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a very close family member pass away
on Christmas Eve.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, that was surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't very sick for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got sick like fucking Wednesday and
died like fucking Thursday or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, it was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, with the support of, my friends like
Clint and the rest of my good family and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, and I can't list everybody because
I'll forget somebody, but you guys know
[SPEAKER_00]: who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who reached out to me and sent
me some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that means a lot to somebody who puts
their, my whole life is out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people return all that love,
that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for getting me through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was my uncle Eric who passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he was a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I get a lot of my smart ass
personality from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, uh, my busy, business savvy,
my comedic sense of timing kind of came
[SPEAKER_00]: from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'm going to miss him a lot,
but I'm doing a lot better since I got all
[SPEAKER_00]: these friends around all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I just ate a fucking big
mouthful of fucking concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a much better mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of emails, a lot of,
a lot of YouTube comments, many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Instagram messages, a lot of
Facebook support, a lot of text messages,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the family is going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think we'll all be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just man, take a minute to hug the
people that you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said that on the last episode,
but this dude got sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like I said, it took just a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just fucking quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's better for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess I don't want to get sick
and suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a nuclear bomb and then it's
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always said, I wanted my last words
to be whee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to something fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds, it sounds exciting when you do
it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a fun death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just dragging it out and
fucking waiting for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what's getting weird and morbid
now, but a big shout out to my uncle Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the rest of my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks uncle Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll see you there one day bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save me some room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but thanks to everybody who sent me
some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here doing a Monday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys got me in the good spirits and
got me ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't be down for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could, I could sit there and fucking cry
and be depressed and hate life for all
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but now what's that going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a fucking smile and my uncle Eric
would say, bro, do your show pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncle Eric was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cried plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cried plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that's it's time to do a podcast
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I still don't miss the dude,
but what are we going to do, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, you had told me go smoke a
joint, get over it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he would have said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the probably the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he would have said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the, uh, so I wasn't going to
talk about my uncle for too long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is where this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I was younger, my uncles had a
lot to do with my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were rowdy bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just what I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were always the stoners in the
back room smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day we're driving to a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took me to my first real concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing Metallica in the fucking
car and they don't realize that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: around some stoners already, but they're
smoking a joint upfront and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize how stoned I got in the back of
that fucking car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But uh, they can't believe it.
They were actually throwing theֳ
reliability stones to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started went to a concert,
had the best time and I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: might've realized I was stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because after that, they started
offering to smoke with me and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they played, uh, Metallica,
the black album on that ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of why I became a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot to do with my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking from talking about my uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks for all the love, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next note says Clint is here,
but you guys know that Clint's here by
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You live like 30 minutes away,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you got to make time for
the things that are important for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same city, 30 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you just say fuck you on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't censor yourself for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be yourself, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it for these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep a family friendly watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is not a family friendly show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not claim to be family friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't worry about that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beard is gnarly, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who trimmed that for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I had a lady do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask if you paid that lady,
but someone will edit this conversation to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a Two Bears, One Cave
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't need to be saying bad things
about the nice lady that trimmed my beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna get me three'd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that show's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Two Bears, One Cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bert and Tom, Tom and Bert.
[SPEAKER_00]: One goes topless, the other wears a shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last Grow From Your Heart
podcast episode of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the final episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the last episode of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote 2020 on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We time traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's the last episode of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the last episode of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 500 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got two things to branch off of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this is the last episode of the year
and we've got 2020 coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I said the wrong year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are looking at their calendars
and freaking the fuck out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they should because we just all time
traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set some goals for 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to do something better in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you suck at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not good at cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not good at trimming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you not know how to tell when to
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really bad at telling when you've
got bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get better at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your weak link and improve upon that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your skill which you lack in in the
garden and brush up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are books.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are standard operating procedures
written on just about every step of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can improve and make your weak link
your strongest link and improve your
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my recommendation for the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what you're sucking at and do better
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of your comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really good at throwing
sidekicks, but you're no good at sweeps,
[SPEAKER_00]: just work on sweeps until you're good at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get better at everything in life by
working at something you suck at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go play the video game that you're
really good at and play the level you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really good at and smoke everybody all
day, you're just feeding your fucking ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go play the level that's hard and
you play against harder people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeding your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go feed your soul a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, feeding your ego is tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I have been having some
conversations, some existential
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations about life here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both we're pretty good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're both approaching a different
generate a different age of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both have I'm fucking 40,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: People probably don't know that when they
see me and listen to the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, a lot of people think I'm younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a 40 year old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a lot of different insight
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have passed away in my life and
things have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely one of those introspective
type of month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I have had some great
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get myself back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need fucking stone you Set some
goals, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set some goals in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only as good as your weakest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get good at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get good at that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on some soul building skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, where do you suck at in life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are you fucking up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that better next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just be honest with yourself first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what you suck at is being
honest with yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I think that's, that's ego,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, if, if, if there's, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm answering mine is like work
on ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what Clint needs to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just always, I always have, I think I
take on too many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to satisfy the demands of too many
different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mind trying to do it,
but sometimes I dig myself a hole because
[SPEAKER_00]: I make too many commitments that I mean
well, trying to do so many things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can only do so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up doing 10 things 90% as well
as I could have, if I would have only
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen to do eight things, a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my downfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I should work on,
but set some goals, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got some goals we can work
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be like, I want to make
a thousand dollars doing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I want to buy a new car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want, that could be
your goal, but it could be something
[SPEAKER_00]: really little.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be something really large.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you struggle just sticking to a
commitment, maybe that's your new New
[SPEAKER_00]: Year's goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to set a goal on a,
on the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could start today, start right now,
but set some goals for your life,
[SPEAKER_00]: set some goals for yourself and then write
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't write it down,
it's just an imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put it on some paper and then
put that paper where you're going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it next to your money, put it on the
fridge, put it next to your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just write just a couple of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, if you're one of those,
if you want to go real far and be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those vision board people, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just write words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a couple of words and those
words remind me every day of, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like do these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep the hustle on,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep moving, stay strong, keep your mind
strong and keep your mental health strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your body strong and reach your
goals, but keep something around to
[SPEAKER_00]: inspire you and remind you of all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to forget people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to wear the,
there are different pieces of religious
[SPEAKER_00]: jewelry that people wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to leave anybody out or
include anybody, but people have religious
[SPEAKER_00]: things that hang on their body or adorn
themselves with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind them of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have those, what would Jesus do
bracelets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something, just something like that,
that you see on a, an occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just go, Oh yeah, I've got this
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people wear a necklace with a
certain shape on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you choose to wear,
but there are certain shapes of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that represent certain things to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put one of those on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remind me, I got to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do my, my mental chores,
my physical chores and get to my goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to get to some goals this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be nice to yourself too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, if you're not going to reach your
goals, don't beat yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do your best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, just take a step towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not your dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun, live your life, but these are
good aspirations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This turned into a different kind of
podcast than usual, but set some goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: write them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impress yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go try and impress everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go try and impress everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just doing shit for likes and
clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does it get you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you likes and clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you log out, you ain't got shit left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many likes did you get on that post
two months ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it may be better that Instagram
has taken off the amount of likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't show you how many likes you get
on your posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it may be healthier for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a disease going through just human
intelligence right now with the way we're
[SPEAKER_01]: using phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I derail in this damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screens, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to a comedy show and we went to a
comedy show at a very large, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Denver convention center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where that place is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Belko theater is hidden inside the
Denver convention center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the Denver convention center is
basically a six foot by nine foot iPad and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Clint and I were hanging out and I
found us both mesmerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this big screen that didn't do anything
really except you could press here and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell it where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would draw you a map from here to
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew how to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fucking smart people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fucking walk from point A to point
B pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat seeing the future stuff
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just mesmerized by that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a list of things you cannot take
into the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We read the whole list just because it was
on some interactive screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't give a shit what we couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no chance we had any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just still just screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just all pretty stoned too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh yeah, we were going to see Tommy
Buns or Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were definitely heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was Joe Rogan that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were pretty wiped out when we
were going to see Tommy Buns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen, uh, the guy with pothead
tattooed across his forehead?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that guy looks a lot like Jeff
Tate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy, you'll see him on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the word pothead and he's got
joints for eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what else was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Set some goals, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just set some goals and you don't have
to beat yourself up over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be anything amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do one thing, do something one last
time, do something one more time,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, just improve in some way,
shape or form and be honest with yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then also remember that social
media is just a game and you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit, quit trying to impress everybody on
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be much happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then, uh, episode 500 is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be toward the end of January,
if my scheduling is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is at the end of January?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy that you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just dropped my pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to do the David Letterman
trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is the Endo Expo,
January 25th and 26th at the Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin, Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at Booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot my booth number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it written down somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be posting that to the social media
so that everybody can find that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been packing up things for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rumor has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got quite the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes, I think there are 20 items on the
menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a rumor that, uh, this guy Clint
may show up at the Endo Expo and could be
[SPEAKER_00]: at my booth for some time at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, I mean, I heard that same rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and also, um, I don't want to confirm
anything, but I also hear that white Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: may be at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people should come by and say,
what's up to Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's the tall guy missing a tooth and
white, white, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it was
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike is the tall guy with the
glasses on the earrings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep calling him Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the, I'm the tall white guy with
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say what's up the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I was, I was more focused on
that's, that's going to be a fun time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be chaotic and fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your tickets early, make your travel
plans, book your hotels, all that good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I've got to
record episode 500 before I can even leave
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be recorded before I get in
the car for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it comes out the Monday after the
Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to have it prerecorded,
ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm reaching out for is I would
like my listeners, my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: my audience, you, you who are listening,
I would like you to give me your ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do for 500?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do for episode 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we just do a normal episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I invite Clint and Mike and possibly
Kevin over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we just record?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we just do a normal grow episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you like on episode 500?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I've been promising that mix
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn to the pages right now so that
Clint can see, look at all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all those notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should exist, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like five pages there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real, that's the mix episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will record that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my head back on my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the way there will be a service
and a funeral here, but right after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to start working on more
episodes back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get that mix episode out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do we do for 500?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 493.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of weeks to put it together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can throw a show together quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need some ideas, some inputs and
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you guys like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make it happen for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just even an idea that you,
have seen somebody else do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know what you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your feedback at grow from your
heart at hotmail.com is probably the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that look on your face,
Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very professional look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, we've been going for like a good 25
minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we should open any more
Pandora's boxes and get rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start talking about too much stuff
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything you would like to
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got a microphone and a small
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so nice to have like been a part of
something that's growing like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause I'm just supporting on the
sidelines for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a great supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are part of the cannabis community
because you do consume and it's been fun
[SPEAKER_00]: watching you go from, I don't smoke,
I kind of smoke, I smoke pretty decently
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to twist your arm,
but I appreciate the support, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need all kinds of members on my team,
cheerleaders and fucking quarterbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a good cheerleader.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do what you got to do,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what friends are for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are you going to say,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what friends are for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been where I left in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were fucking doing just fine right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this was a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to come and have Clint on
the show and just kind of hang out and
[SPEAKER_00]: record a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell everybody, thank you for all the love
and support you've been giving me while
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through some weird shit with my
uncle passing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay because I'm going to be all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got no other choice than to be all
right, but I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of good friends pass
through and say, hi, the holidays were,
[SPEAKER_00]: being with my family made the holidays a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of brought us together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had Christmas dinner and by the end of
Christmas dinner, I think we all felt a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of relief, like just being
together and telling some stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And laughing and talking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what my uncle would have
wanted us to get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: His two sisters and his brothers were
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just talking shit about him and
each other and just like it should have
[SPEAKER_00]: been, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a minute to get there,
but once we got there, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send all of the love back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint, thanks for hanging out,
dude.
