[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode 876 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got a great episode lined
up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get too far, I do want to send a
big thank you shout out for all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: great responses to the previous episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: The previous episode, of course,
was the clone care show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a full podcast about taking clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about making clones in an easy
cloner environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about clones in a clone dome
setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on for a full hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of great response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all of the great responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shows a lot of energy to put together
and it definitely was worth it due to all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the great response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't see it already, after you
watch this one, go check out the previous
[SPEAKER_02]: show about cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the very near future, I will work
on an episode about potting those clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you cut them, they're going to start
to grow roots eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to put them into
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make an episode for you about that
coming soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is going to be a question and
answer podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: That website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you click on that tab, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to send me a grow question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_02]: a free pack of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question on today's podcast came
from our new friend who wants to be called
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my new friend,
Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, check your inbox and also check your
spam because you have got a coupon code
[SPEAKER_02]: for a free pack of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan's question, there's a nice intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does mention that he is a veteran,
a disabled veteran.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it gets right to the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I have a question on growing
naturally and scrogging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrogging, of course, is when we put a net
down and we work the plants into the net
[SPEAKER_02]: and we trellis them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk more about that as we go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says, I have a question about
growing naturally and scrogging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So naturally is going to be not scrogging
them out, just letting them grow wild,
[SPEAKER_02]: letting them get big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big difference, in my opinion,
in my grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, when you do, which do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown both ways and I've hit a
monster number on two plants in an AC
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinity four by five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit 15 plus ounces on a harvest and a
four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got 15 ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can improve that, my dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee we can improve that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad harvest, but we can
increase that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I've grown other plants naturally
and only lollipop them and I get roughly
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ross.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Jeff, I look forward to hearing your
reply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep pushing them killers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wraps it up with, I have been wanting
the lemon Jeffrey, but you seem to be out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm out of lemon Jeffrey seeds for
the time being.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will make more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are in the rotation to be re remade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes me a minute to get them back
in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be clones and cuts available on
iREDirect randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe join the newsletter on iregenetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will let you know when those clones and
cuttings are available, but the lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeffrey will be back in seed form
eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main part of the question is which do
I prefer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I prefer to trellis the plants out or
let them grow naturally was the other
[SPEAKER_02]: option here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of depends on the goal and the
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm just doing a quick phenohunt and I
want to run small plants, I might do a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of those and I will not trellis
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will put up a trellis net, but it serves
a different purpose in this run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just use that net as a
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants are going to grow right up
into it and that one top cola is just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be support.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that trellis net is for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when some runs, no, I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm just doing a quick small run of a
phenohunt to pack a tent full of just a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of small plants and see what we get,
then no, I will not trellis them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not top them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do minimal lollipopping, which is
just cleaning up that junk on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimal work to them on a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once I found the keeper plant and I'm
filling up a tent and I want to make some
[SPEAKER_02]: production out of it, I trellis the shit
out of those rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I scrog it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start with plants that are
approximately waist high, chest high to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a tall dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three or four feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll bang those plants down until
they're two feet tall to start my trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will work those plants out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of being this tall, I'll bang them
out to be a flat canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason for doing this, there's a lot
of reasons for doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find, and I do this in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trellis them very heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put out the nets and then I work the
plants into that canopy very heavily all
[SPEAKER_02]: through veg, early flower, and then
possibly late into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't stop working them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can level that out a little bit,
I will still keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My reason for this, if I don't do it,
I'm going to get those big giant glory
[SPEAKER_02]: buds that grow right into my lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get a bunch of buds down here
at the bottom that aren't getting enough
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could top that and take that big top
out, or I could bend that bad bitch over
[SPEAKER_02]: and work it through the net and work it
down the canopy a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could take all those side branches and
pull those down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a branch that is growing straight
up or kind of up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growing out from the plant and
growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growing upward.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants want to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go toward the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity tells them which way is up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: One branch is going to fight for the top
at all times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we trellis them down, we do a few
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant starts to say, hey, all the tops
have been lowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a chance to be the top at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I could be the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all start growing more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It evens out the growth of that plant a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hormones move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes that plant want to grow more
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to grow more evenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now also what will happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those branches that were growing up,
we've now leveled them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're horizontal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now your shoots are going to grow out of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally you'd grow a branch and it would
get a shoot right here that would grow a
[SPEAKER_02]: bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would get a shoot that would grow a
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now your plant is horizontal.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those shoots are going to grow
vertically up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have a nice,
smooth, even canopy with a bunch of shoots
[SPEAKER_02]: growing out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of just a bunch of like three or
four big donkey dicks, now we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a whole bunch of regular size dicks,
which is a very terrible comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish I wouldn't have gone that
route.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now instead of just those three big
fucking glory buds in the room,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got a whole bunch of nice
manageable buds across the entire room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you're growing in a five by five
tent and you've got that hot LED light,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have a couple of buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't trellis them, you'll have a
couple of buds that are right at that
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tops of those are going to look like
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get a little bit better as it gets
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then down here at the bottom,
all these plants are going to be shaded
[SPEAKER_02]: out by your colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to get enough light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we've spread that out and evened
it out, that light is going to be even
[SPEAKER_02]: across the whole canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get nice, even buds in the
entire tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can do that in a gigantic room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to run rows that were six feet wide
and 75 feet long and trellis the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it came harvest time,
the canopy was perfectly fucking even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants, it just looked like you took
a hedge trimmer, an even amount,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we worked that canopy so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I prefer to trellis them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to scrog them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going for production, if I want
numbers, if I want to see some results,
[SPEAKER_02]: even in my breeding runs, I trellis those
plants down because I can lower it,
[SPEAKER_02]: spread it out more and not get them up
there toward that hot light, create a more
[SPEAKER_02]: even space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do, I take that branch and you
can watch there are a thousand great
[SPEAKER_02]: videos out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Scrog it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be a professional Scroggr,
I always shout out Mr. Rob Janie taught me
[SPEAKER_02]: how to really Scrog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew how to do it was intimidated by Rob
Janie was kind of like, don't be a pussy,
[SPEAKER_02]: pop it, twist it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrog that bitch in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I really learned how to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're taking a branch that's going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grab it down here a little
bit and give it a little twist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear go pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that branch is very manipulatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the word is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to, I've got my net
that is, it's about here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: My net has come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lowered my nets where this top is
just sticking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to bend that branch down into
another square of the net and work it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's long enough, I'll let it pop
out of the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that part is going to start growing
and working its way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these shoots now are going to work
their way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When this one gets a little bit longer,
I might work it into the next part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't get long enough,
I might free it and let it grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a, a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: The canopy, the Scrogging is a daily
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in there every couple of days,
just popping them, twisting them,
[SPEAKER_02]: working them where I want to be so that I
can maximize that five by five space.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy named Eric Bixa that wrote
an article called growing on the grid,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably 25 years ago that I read and
that's stuck in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I want to grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a five by five tent that is five
by five by five by five, whatever you do
[SPEAKER_02]: the geometry there, this many cubic feet
of grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you, if I told you fill that cubic
grow space with weed, do you want a low
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy with a couple of big buds sticking
out, wasting space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you try to pack that bitch nice
and evenly to where all of that canopy is
[SPEAKER_02]: filled with weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Eric Bixa teaches us to do and
the article growing on the grid he wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his ideal setup, what I would do also
now what I've kind of learned,
[SPEAKER_02]: I use two net systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to pull the plants down to lower
them and I weave them into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then as they grow, I put up another net to
support those colas because if I do it
[SPEAKER_02]: right, they're going to get big in a big
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put a third net also, it would get
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it sounds wild, but those buds were
four or five, six or seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first, my first grog is to pull them
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: My second one is to grow to keep them
supported.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to do is have one cola in
every square of my three by three canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: netting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one bud and everything that is called
growing on the grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned that one from Eric Bixa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that I learned was from my
buddy Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Subcool, rest in peace,
brother fucking miss you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you were still around to teach me
some more shit and spread some good seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Subcool once taught me, he said the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I gave you a fucking cooler brother and
I told you to fill it with weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: would you put a few buds in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This way and stack them up like baguettes
where you can barely close it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you put a bunch of normal size
buds in there and just fill that bad bitch
[SPEAKER_02]: all day with normal size buds?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I prefer scrogging,
trellising, working a canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not just pulling the net down and
fucking narrow lowering the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I let the plants grow and then I just drop
the net right on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pull it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it on each corner of the tent and
pull two corners at a time and just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of work my way around and watch the plants
bend down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see, you'll start getting stressed
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're freaking out those plants are
going to bend or break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you need to start getting in
there and spreading them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to teach you all about
scrogging right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Scroggit is who to go for for that,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many videos out there, but spread them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I also recommend popping and twisting
the bottom from where the plant comes out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the dirt up to where all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I popped that main stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grab it with two hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a little twist, a pop,
and then I do it up again up here,
[SPEAKER_02]: pop, and then I do it again up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop and I'll work the entire main stock of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I've done from top to bottom of that
main stock, I'll do every single branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop, pop, pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: What this does is it makes a little knurl,
a knuckle in your branch and that branch
[SPEAKER_02]: will get a little bit stronger and a
little bit thicker and a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: robust.
[SPEAKER_02]: This serves a couple of purposes in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will allow for sturdier, beefier
plants which can support bigger,
[SPEAKER_02]: sturdier, beefier buds and those bigger
branches are going to be able to promote
[SPEAKER_02]: more bud growth as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next thing I do, I take off all
that shit on the bottom below that first
[SPEAKER_02]: net.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they start to grow into that,
once they start growing into that second
[SPEAKER_02]: net, I start cleaning out all that shit on
the bottom, all the little sucker
[SPEAKER_02]: branches, all the larphy shit,
the stuff that's not going to be worth
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not going to give me anything
worth trimming down there, take it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take off the long branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they reach up to the net, leave those
branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't make it up to that net,
consider taking those branches right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean up that bottom of that canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make all that energy go up to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one of my pieces of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're twisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing twisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're popping the branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're twisting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cleaning up the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lollipopping a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once these plants start growing up into
this net, I'm going to pop that growth
[SPEAKER_02]: also up top up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that net is looking like it's full,
that's when I'm going to put that room
[SPEAKER_02]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I do this correctly, if I choose the
correct strains and line up the room and
[SPEAKER_02]: veg the appropriate time and make this
work, it is very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very easily in a five by five tent,
you could easily achieve two, even two and
[SPEAKER_02]: a half, maybe three pounds if you're
paying attention and you're choosing the
[SPEAKER_02]: right strains and you know your strains,
you know how to feed them, you know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: pop, twist, lollipop.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know how to trellis it all
properly, you can hit three pounds in a
[SPEAKER_02]: five by five tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely going to depend on your
skill level, your dedication, your
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, and also your environment,
your lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that will matter, but it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you trellis and scrog it properly,
I've never gotten that close without doing
[SPEAKER_02]: a trellis system, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are we there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I answered all of your questions
and then some rambled pretty good on that
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dude, Ryan D, make sure you check your
inbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I said, you've got a coupon
code for a free pack of seeds at
[SPEAKER_02]: ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ganja farmers, let's keep this
good energy going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have another good question here that
came from the grow help tab on
[SPEAKER_02]: ireagenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came from my new friend who wants
to be called Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe, make sure you check your inbox
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_02]: free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I jump into this question,
let me remind you that this show is
[SPEAKER_02]: brought to you by our good friends at
acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow the link in the show notes and the
video description to acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you check out, use coupon code
irearmy to save yourself 10% at checkout.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, 10% at acinfinity.com with
coupon code irearmy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, that coupon code is good on their
eBay store and also their Amazon store.
[SPEAKER_02]: That coupon code works on almost all of
the AC infinity official stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that was harder to say than it
looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: irearmy is the coupon code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's jump into this question now before I
stutter a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, if I pollinate a fem seed with a
male from another variety, so they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that came from a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now just a normal plant at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: No real noticeable difference from this
female fem plant and a regular seed plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I pollinate a fem seed with a male
from another variety, now I've just got a
[SPEAKER_02]: male plant, just random random dude came
by and they hooked up and they did their
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, will the progeny of them
have more intersex traits?
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, what do you mean more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the more coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be no intersex trait at all
in this setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have your fem seed as a true
female, which that was up to the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: before that, then that should be a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should not be the misnomer that
feminized seeds are intersex or
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodites or herms is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not how it is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me talk real quick about this
because I love to do this ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: If made properly, feminized seeds do not
contain any hermaphroditic trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think of feminized seeds,
when you think of making fem seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: take the word hermaphrodite, intersex,
hermy, herm, all that needs to be removed
[SPEAKER_02]: from this whole entire equation because
what needs to be done for proper feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds is two true female plants need to be
used, which means the breeder that grew
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants that bred with these plants
has grown these plants multiple times in
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple environments and given them
stresses on purpose, fucked with these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants a lot to see what they do under
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see if I see intersex traits
present themselves in my breeding stock,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not make seeds out of that breeding
stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there should not be any.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also I test those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow those seeds that are made and we
should not see any intersex in that
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my fem seeds, there's no and we were
when we do the reversal process,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're reversing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say making it herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is ignorance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's miseducation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not what is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are using a solution I am using a
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are multiple different products and
ways out there now to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're doing is disrupting the
copper movement within the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: which creates I'm not going to go too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a reaction in the plant,
a hormonal reaction within the plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: says, hey, I got to figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that female plant creates anthers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not making it herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is creating full anthers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are treating it with a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would not have happened without a
chemical solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am causing this with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a hermaphrodite plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hermaphrodite involved plant A and plant
B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither one of those were hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: The progeny that comes from that no
hermaphrodites in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not giving you any hermaphrodites
to start with the male plant that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say that it's been tested and
it's not hermaphroditic at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no intersex traits there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would the herm trait come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be maybe it's a super
recessive trait that is hidden in these
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be unlocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the grandparents, great
grandparents, somewhere down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: May have had the intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could unlock that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's possible, but highly unlikely if
the breeding is done properly here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that will the progeny of them
have more intersex traits?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did the intersex come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I kind of think of breeding,
and this is mostly accurate except the
[SPEAKER_02]: flaw here is recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that I think of breeding is the
ingredients you put in or the ingredients
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a lot like cheffing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except there's also with cheffing,
there's a lot of shit happening behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: scenes that we can't see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have a few senses and traits we
can observe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also see food.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see both of them, you go,
I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what traits you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like fried looking shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like stuff that's been decorated
with frosting and fucking crumbly shit on
[SPEAKER_02]: top of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what triggers your brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of weed do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like purple weed, bright green
weed, dark green weed with fucking purple
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're into, you know what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our eyes, we got our nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you even see food, you smell it and
you know, I want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you go, that gumbo smells like dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your brain tells you, it does the
same thing with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only got a few senses and we can use
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like cheffing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you get, if you put chocolate
and strawberry into your oven and mix it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making up a cake here is what I'm
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you make a chocolate strawberry
flavored cake, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate strawberry flavored outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put non hermaphroditic plants
together, where did the hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_02]: traits come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm trying to get to in this long
ass ramble here is you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: what you get out what you put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if nothing is intersex going in,
nothing is intersex coming out unless like
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, my flaw here is that recessive
trait, that old recessive gene that may
[SPEAKER_02]: have lied in one of the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've tested the mom, the dad and the
mom and the dad of both of these plants
[SPEAKER_02]: enough times where I know there should not
be intersex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of more no, that that
shouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fems are not herms in the first place
and your male plant is not a herm in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only real difference and I've been
giving a lot of shout outs on knowledge in
[SPEAKER_02]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference in a feminized seed
and a non feminized seed is the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollen is the only difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that pollen hits the ovule and the
plant happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no difference, except there's no
option for a male chromosome to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: there because there were no male
chromosomes present in this breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to give some credit to my
friend Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Soul put this analogy in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an idea of how to teach you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if we took a male plant and a
female plant and we figured out how to
[SPEAKER_02]: remove the male pollen from the air before
it got to the female.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what we've learned how to
do when making fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that the pollen is what decides
sex because I'm not treating the female
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollen receiver are not getting
treated any specially any special way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollen donor is the one I'm fucking
with and manipulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that is where my female traits
are coming from my all female pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where that's coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, imagine if you learned how
to suck the male pollen right out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: air before it got to the girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we are doing with fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that interaction happens,
the difference is over.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like to think, say, claim,
show me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the same strain in a reg seed,
the same strain in a fem seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Run them side by side in the exact same
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to do this four or
five, maybe 10 times because genetics are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeders are going to be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I bet scientifically, we don't see
much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet smoking wise, we don't see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you won't notice a lot of
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say that the fem seeds have less
vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are less potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild because I sell a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I offer regular and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put seeds on the website for very fair
prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And approximately 80% of my seed sales are
fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're so shitty, why are people
coming back and buying fem seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Lemon Jeffrey, Golden Goat,
Orange Gas, Rose, Blanche, my top sellers
[SPEAKER_02]: lately are fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: All fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is my argument there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really rambled on that one for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was supposed to be an episode where I
banged through a bunch of these papers and
[SPEAKER_02]: got a bunch of questions answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, you're getting long fucking
answers today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Joe, I hope I answered your
question because I've been talking long
[SPEAKER_02]: enough, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, unless you put herms in, herms won't
come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to compare it to a breeding mix
and got lost on that or to a growing mix
[SPEAKER_02]: and a baking mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't put it together today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my brain working for you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, check your inbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a coupon code for a free pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump into another question

forward slash grow from your heart if you
[SPEAKER_02]: do want to support the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I was going to read more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came from a friend who wants to
be called twisted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my dude, twisted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like the official twisted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, we have another pollen
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I would stick with the theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I use pollen from a reversed female on
another plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: If yes, will that cross be feminized too?
[SPEAKER_02]: So now this lets me piggyback on the last
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This listener wants to use pollen that
came from a reversed female.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have treated that plant with a solution
that is now making pollen, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got that pollen from our reversed
female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we put this on another plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is making new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open up the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that cross be feminized also?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because like I said a moment ago,
that pollen is what dictates the
[SPEAKER_02]: feminization, that's a word I think I
might've just made up, of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollen is what dictates the male or
female and we're using all female pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: so your progeny will be all female.
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes me want to explain a couple of
growing and breeding terms and labeling
[SPEAKER_02]: terms with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said if I use pollen from a
reversed female, let's start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got pollen from a reversed female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say for shits and giggles,
because this is familiar in my head,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant we're working with here is
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taken a golden goat female.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have made reversed pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna take that pollen and put it on
another clone of golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same plant, just a different clone,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same fucking genetics, just a different
plant of the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: My screen just went all blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I have a computer anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need notes right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Panic mode has set the fuck in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've taken that pollen from the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it on the other golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is golden goat S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what is known as an S1 or a selfed
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat, and this is the way you're
gonna remember it, golden goat fucked
[SPEAKER_02]: itself, selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just jerked itself off, made its own
seeds of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat, selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the first time this happened,
that's a golden goat S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first generation of selfed seeds is
that S1 golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took the golden goat on golden goat,
pure golden goat S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's gonna stick in your brain
the way that I said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's take this golden goat pollen
and put it on some other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did we put it on?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my notes, we're gonna put it on a lemon
skunk plant, and we're also going to put
[SPEAKER_02]: that golden goat pollen on a, what's the
other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a platinum tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is going to make the lemon skunk
to golden goat makes lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly how I made lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: The golden goat, I don't know how I said
that just now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have fucked up the word again in
my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking too many thoughts with this
blue screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just fix this blue screen of doom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we took the golden goat
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna put it on a lemon skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take the golden goat pollen and put
that on platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are both feminized and also two of
my best-selling strains I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by putting that pollen on another
plant, that is a reversed pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is known as an R1, a reversed
pollination generation one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an R.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I take the pollen from a plant and put
it on itself, I have selfed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I take that pollen, the feminized
pollen, and put it on another plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is an R, a reversal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the first time this has happened,
it is a one that goes after that,
[SPEAKER_02]: an S1 or an R1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to confuse you with other
generations and further things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be a future episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me check my notes and get the fur out
of my eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a little furry from my hat here
getting in my eyeball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even gonna edit that shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I made... So the golden goat
S1s straight up that I sell that will be
[SPEAKER_02]: restocked on the website probably early
fall, late summer, those are S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I take that golden goat pollen and
put it on the platinum tangy, that makes
[SPEAKER_02]: orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I put it on the lemon Jeffrey or on
the lemon skunk, that makes lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I put it on the red Lebanese hash
plant, that makes rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I put it on the blue raspberry
truffle, that makes blanche.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those last few plants are what are known
as R1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you saw the spit, not even gonna
edit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are R1s, self and reversals.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those will be feminized because
like I keep saying, that pollen came from
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chukers, all of you lovely cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to thank you once again for

[SPEAKER_02]: I have honestly ran out of new shit to
offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been offering old shit and trying
to keep up but have no fear because there
[SPEAKER_02]: are new seeds coming very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a recent a recent harvest of
some blueberry regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not talk too much about it because
I've been fucking jinxing myself by
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about talking about projects too
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of kept this one on the download and
it works like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of new blueberry crosses.
