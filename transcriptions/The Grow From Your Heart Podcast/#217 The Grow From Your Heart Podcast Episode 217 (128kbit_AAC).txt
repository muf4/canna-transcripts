[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 217 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Koo and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are
smoking something delicious with me right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a fat dab of some bear dance
butter from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_01]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot even describe the flavor of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to smell it again just to see if
it makes me think of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes some herb has a dryer
sheet sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff has a dryer sheet kind of a
smell happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something smooth, something silky,
but then there's a sweet berry taste at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of it that I'm really digging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not usually a fan of the berry weed,
but this dryer sheet smell on the high
[SPEAKER_01]: from this bear dance batter is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got kind of a cheesecake sort of a
texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like some cheesecake batter,
some cake batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab, when you take a dab, a little
tiny dab goes a lot further than you would
[SPEAKER_01]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives a lot of smoke, a lot of vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to my friends at Apothecary
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the amazing bear dance batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably hear that it made me
cough a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, the dab I took made me
sneeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear that in my throat for a couple
of seconds, but I promise it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't promise you I'm not positive,
but I'm fairly certain that will fade away
[SPEAKER_01]: as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the high fades a little more
slowly than the chest congestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, bear dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, let's talk about the bear dance
and why I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked this up at Apothecary on
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I chose to buy the bear dance
is because I was going to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: remaining members of the Grateful Dead,
which are now known as Dead & Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it would only be appropriate to
smoke bear dance hash at the Dead & Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about Dead &
Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: before we get into some cannabis talk
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to talk about cannabis on
this episode, I promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday, I got to see Dead & Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: at Folsom Field in Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny Beth looked super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: People could not quit staring at her all
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day, it was a little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: She bought a dress that showed her
features very well, and she looked fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super sunshiney.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grateful Dead came on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep calling them the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Dead & Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The remaining, it's the original two
drummers, Mickey Hart and Billy Krutzman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got Bobby Ware, original
member of the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over there on bass, they've got a
dude by the name of Oteal Burbridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have heard of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude plays a mean bass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they've got a dude named Jeff Ciminti
on keyboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this young guy that you
might have heard of him before.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is John Mayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He plays guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've talked about this on the
podcast before.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago, when I heard that John
Mayer was playing in Jerry's spot in The
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful Dead, I was, I don't know what
the feeling was, but I doubted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had skeptical hippo eyes right at the
very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've gone and seen it a few times now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually caught a few shows of the
newest version of The Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And John Mayer nails it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be a critic, if you want to
be a hater, go see a show and you will be
[SPEAKER_01]: blown away at the way John Mayer fits in
with The Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a couple of jokes though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayer does bring a younger crowd and you
can tell who's there to see Mayer because
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't put their phones down and they
don't shut the fuck up during the concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm seeing The Grateful Dead or a
Grateful Dead style band, they're jammy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do psychedelic long extended songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to get in my head into
this little bubble that happens when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're watching that and not be
interrupted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these younger kids that are going
to the shows now, they want to fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: talk over the jams.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to ask you what song they're
playing and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't dig it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut the fuck up when Jerry's playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go see Fish in a couple of
weeks and I might get a shirt made that
[SPEAKER_01]: says shut up when Fish is playing just
because that's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to be a bitch about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pay a lot of money to go see your
favorite band and then some kids are right
[SPEAKER_01]: behind you just talking through the whole
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll turn around and be like,
hey bro, can you maybe not talk during
[SPEAKER_01]: this song?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they think you're a dick because
you want to hear whatever song you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, overall, it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were enough cool ass people there to
override all the young kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Mayer played the shit out of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early in the show, there was a great
version of Ramble on Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: They played a really long version of Dark
Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: One More Saturday Night was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were tons of great songs,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I can't remember all the songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have them in a list here, but unless
you're a deadhead, you probably don't
[SPEAKER_01]: care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are a deadhead, you probably
already know what they played that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw the show, they tore it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do want to talk about,
their current bass player is named Oteel
[SPEAKER_01]: Burbridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's played with bands that you've heard
of before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to go too much into the
music talking nerd out because music is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my top three favorite things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and music are two of my top three
favorite things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a guess what the third one is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oteel sang China Doll.
[SPEAKER_01]: This version of this band has been
together for a couple, maybe three years
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember exactly when they
started, but they've been together for
[SPEAKER_01]: around two or three years and Oteel has
not sang.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few nights ago in California,
he sang China Doll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a couple of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the band stops and they start tuning
their guitars and everybody starts hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects pedals on their guitar to get
to the effects they need and the keyboard
[SPEAKER_01]: guy warms up by playing a couple of notes
in the next song, I'm really good at
[SPEAKER_01]: guessing what song it's about to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the music nerd in me can spot it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at Jenny and I was like,
they are going to play China Doll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that she was going to love it
because she loves when they play slow,
[SPEAKER_01]: mellow songs and she's been wanting to
hear Oteel sing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put my arm around her and I just
smiled and I was like, she is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we danced together for a couple of
seconds and I just kind of stepped aside
[SPEAKER_01]: and let her just have her moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when girls are super happy and
they're not sure if they want to smile or
[SPEAKER_01]: cry and they put their hands in kind of
like a prey thing and they just touch
[SPEAKER_01]: their mouth with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it right now for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did that for the entire duration of
the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about six or eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just smiled and bobbed back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah, saw the dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did China Doll.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite parts of the show,
they did China Cat into I Know You Writer
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a part in the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line is, I wish I were a headlight on
a northbound train.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd shine my light through that cool
Colorado rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they sing the Colorado rain part,
that whole field erupted with cheer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was coming because I know the
song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just looking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is going to be fucking
rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty damn cool to hear the
whole crowd just go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Grateful Dead, they tore it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to seeing fish here in just
a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are going to see fish,
I would love to see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have some seed packs in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go to shows, I put a couple of
packs in my pockets and I just carry them
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you see me, you high five me,
you hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I got some seeds for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a new printer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that significant?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is significant because now I am able
to print off the emails that you guys send
[SPEAKER_01]: me and I can bring them to the podcast a
little better than fumbling through my
[SPEAKER_01]: phone, trying to find the appropriate
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of doing that, they're right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the messages I'm going to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to go dig through my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me look, sound, and feel a little
bit more professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a printer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to just wirelessly shoot the
messages from my phone right to the
[SPEAKER_01]: printer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come out and read them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my throat is still fucking up from that
dad that I took.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to take a drink and then
honestly, I'll probably take another dab
[SPEAKER_01]: and just chill out for a second until my
throat quits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will come back and we will read
some of these emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to start off with an email
from a guy who calls himself Saint Skinny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to work our way
through to Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you never know where we might go
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ladies and gentlemen, you heat up a
nail and take a dab and then drink some
[SPEAKER_01]: water or something natural, maybe some
kombucha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the power of recording magic,
I will be back in half a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you took a couple of fat dabs
during my quick break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was really brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far into the show,
I need to do something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to wish somebody very special,
a very special happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to wish two people a happy
birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them probably does not listen to
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them definitely does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple of days ago, it was my
beautiful daughter, Maya's birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 14th birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure she doesn't listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, I got to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, kiddo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, somebody that I know is listening,
she's probably smoking a big old dab right
[SPEAKER_01]: now and listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dabbing granny had her birthday today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is 619 and it is the dabbing
granny's birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is 62 years old today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind announcing how old she is
because she did a 0.62 gram dab on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram for her 62nd birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get you back on the show real
soon, granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have time, drive down to
Pueblo or I will drive up to Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can go to the Canyon Canyon or
somewhere and hang out for an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do some Facebook live, maybe some
Instagram live, maybe some Periscope
[SPEAKER_01]: videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly need to record a Grow From
Your Heart podcast together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge happy birthday blessings to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you every day and I miss hanging
out with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, big high five to Kevin, the grumpy
grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dabbing granny, as a partner in crime,
known as the grumpy grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a great couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: High five to both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move forward with this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did tease that we were going to read
some emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got them in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel all professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Dave Letterman or Jimmy Fallon
or somebody popular and famous and on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't watch a lot of TV, so I was trying
to fake some names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jimmy Kimmel is who I was fucking thinking
of and it took me a lot of time to come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, but I feel like Jimmy Kimmel or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Dave Letterman flicking my
pencil up in the air and letting it do
[SPEAKER_01]: flips and then catching it like a pimp and
then marking down on the paper what I
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to quit rambling and I'll read
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I took dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking working.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this first email, and by the
way, if you'd like to email me,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read your emails on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I've got a printer, I assume,
I imagine, I predict I'll be reading a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more emails and I'll get a lot more
organized with a lot more shit also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag, they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jeff, and then this dude put in
parentheses, you can use my name,
[SPEAKER_01]: St. Skinny or St. Or Skinny to refer to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a picky dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he goes on to say, I thought I'd
share some of the music I like to listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to after getting nice and toasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys remember on the 420 episode,
I asked people to email me, to tweet me,
[SPEAKER_01]: to message me in some way and let me know
what kind of music they listen to after
[SPEAKER_01]: they smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The messages are still coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast never goes away, so people
will reply for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is what my friend St. Skinny
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said,
[SPEAKER_01]: He typed is not a great song, but I think
he probably meant, if you don't know Marty
[SPEAKER_01]: Robbins, El Paso is a great song with some
gorgeous guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know Johnny Horton,
I'd suggest the battle of New Orleans
[SPEAKER_01]: where they used a gator as a cannon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess where the powder went.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes more sense the way,
yeah, I think he just got ahead of himself
[SPEAKER_01]: with the knot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to check out some Johnny
Horton and some Marty Robbins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that's stuff we've got to listen
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: St. Skinny recommended it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have like a Rasta Jeff's music club
sort of thing going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, maybe we'll discover one
of our new favorite bands by finding out
[SPEAKER_01]: what our friends are listening to through
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, keep doing your thing,
Jeff, and thanks for the shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: mom and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: She heard it coming home from the hospital
and about had her in tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little things like that mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama Saint is in the hospital again,
getting her bone marrow transplant to
[SPEAKER_01]: fight off the leukemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well wishes, prayers and positive vibes
are appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been listening to the show for a
while, you guys probably have heard me
[SPEAKER_01]: read emails from St. Skinny before and he
was telling us about his mom being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital and I gave her a shout out on an
episode and she happened to be in the car
[SPEAKER_01]: when St. Skinny was playing the episode
and she heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been corresponding a little
bit through emails with St. Skinny and you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, he said that she is in the hospital
again, getting her a bone marrow
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant to fight off leukemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be a horrible experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I have never experienced
anything that horrible and I hope I never
[SPEAKER_01]: have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful that I am healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a traumatic brain injury that fucked
me up, but that just happened and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: was over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like I got hit and then I woke up
all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like getting bone marrow transplant
is a long, slow battle and it's got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever you believe in, I'm not going
to ask what you believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could believe in Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could believe in Jaras Tafara.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could believe in Buddha.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could believe in rocks and trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could believe in nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want you to do is think about
St. Skinny's mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just imagine a nice looking lady,
a mom, just a nice looking lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you think a mom looks like in
your head, imagine her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then imagine this one being St.
Skinny's mom and she needs bone marrow
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant and she feels like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you guys just to send her some
love from your heart because no matter
[SPEAKER_01]: what you believe in, what your religion,
you got love in your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So send a little bit of that to St.
Skinny's mom just to get her through this
[SPEAKER_01]: bone marrow transplant because that's got
to fucking suck you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're well enough to be at work or in
your car or whatever, you got a second to
[SPEAKER_01]: send some love to this nice lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just do it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Altogether right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only going to take half a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you feel it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you did too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: St. Skinny, I hope it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that all that love lands on your
mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope she starts feeling a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I call her?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I call her mama saint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what we're going to call her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama saint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope things go well for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know how you're using cannabis to
deal with this because I've never dealt
[SPEAKER_01]: with leukemia and a bone marrow
transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you could teach me things and
if you don't mind, I'll share it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners and we can kind of turn a
positive out of a shitty negative thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best we could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best I could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are well, St. and mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skinny saint, St. Skinny and mama saint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to know how St. Skinny came
up also to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been corresponding for a while,
so share that with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ends the email with, stay red-eyed,
smiley, and live life iry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My life is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a beautiful, healthy daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fairly healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm falling apart a little bit here and
there, but I'm fairly healthy for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am living life iry and I hope that
you and your family are doing well with
[SPEAKER_01]: what you guys are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love your guys' direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody send a little love to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move forward with another
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skinny, thanks for the email, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to your mom also.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from a guy who calls himself
Godfather Kush and he says, Good day to
[SPEAKER_01]: you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you are fully medicated and loving
life right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry in advance for this long email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, don't be sorry for long emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it takes a lot of words to say
how you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody understands that, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of words sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rambling as shit right now,
but let's get on with this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I'm a new listener and I dig the
show for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listened to all episodes available on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must have been meant to be because as
soon as I ran out and caught up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: current episodes, you posted your first
few shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you listen on Thursdays,
I post old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going and making, it's usually
three episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I can fit four or five in a
three hour file, but I've been going and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting old episodes and just sequentially
putting them back out in order in chunks
[SPEAKER_01]: of three because the iTunes and Stitcher
feed only hold 100 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time I put out a new show,
something falls out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm putting them up in chunks of three,
hoping I can get old episodes up so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can re-listen and still have fresh content
up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm doing it, I'm making videos for
the older episodes and putting those on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube because eventually the reposts are
going to fall out of the feed also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to have a lot of content is
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the archives will end up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most recent 100-ish episodes will
be on iTunes and Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm doing is putting out the old
stuff because there's a lot of valuable
[SPEAKER_01]: content in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my really written and thought out
episodes were in about 55 to 100,
[SPEAKER_01]: were some of the most educational stuff
that I put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be back in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get back to the email
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I want you to know that your
message and vibe really come across in a
[SPEAKER_01]: positive and uplifting way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your character and attitude really makes
it known that you are coming from such a
[SPEAKER_01]: real place in your heart and are a true
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the fact you breed strains
with patience in mind and you don't just
[SPEAKER_01]: cross attractive strain names for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only imagine how many people you
were able to bring to enlightenment when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breaking stoner stereotypes is what this
world needs and you are doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The past four sentences you said really
mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really high and I really mean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My character and attitude make it known
that I'm coming from a real place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done 217 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put an episode out every Monday for
three years because I'm dedicated and I
[SPEAKER_01]: love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming from a true place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am a true caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I just sit and listen to my
friends talk and we smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think sometimes just listening to a
guy talk and nodding your head,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it's all somebody needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody just wants to be heard
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can provide that and just also
provide a little medical relief at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, you're really doing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being a caregiver, yes, I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys just take a minute and just
fucking sit down with somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just sitting there smoking with
people anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go find somebody that needs some help and
smoke with them and just talk for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll feel like, oh man, I just sucked up
all their problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you might realize like,
I don't have those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll be able to help them and
everyone will feel a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, he likes the fact that I breed
strains with my patients in mind and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't just cross, don't just cross for
attractive strain names.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to breed with a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I'm looking for when I start
breeding and I will scrap a project if it
[SPEAKER_01]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how many people I am able to
bring to enlightenment about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I hope just a few people would make me
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I'm reaching a large audience,
but just a few would make me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I'm changing one person a day,
that would make me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one person every day listens and goes,
you know what, this pothead guy isn't that
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might learn some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So breaking stoner stereotypes is what the
world needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's partly why I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've always been well-spoken and
kind of a speech kind of a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been that dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like it was kind of my
responsibility to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're telling me that I'm doing a
great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've been at it for a long time and
I have pride, but still being told you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a good job always feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter who it's from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go on to say, I'm done
blowing all that smoke your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to let you know that you have a
new fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will promise to give you quality content
as long as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you keep going and you say,
I went to the dank team to get my hands on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of your art.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a couple available, but not much
and not really what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, however, get a freebie with an
order and I'm pumped on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down here in New Mexico and I've heard
you shout out Organtica and how they have
[SPEAKER_01]: a 30% plus a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping it comes through on your
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got my cookie cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, definitely looking for a
short and potent, definitely looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: short and potent and we'll let you know
what I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything really does happen for a reason
because even as I type this, I'm listening
[SPEAKER_01]: to the latest episode and you tease some
upcoming seed and strain talk and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, I'm a new fan of you and
what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't mind hearing more about what
you were breeding and when you will
[SPEAKER_01]: replenish the dank team with your fine
craftsmanship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brag more on your art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind it one bit and I'm sure other
people like it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mom says, what the hell's a Rasta
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she got a hug anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude said, take a fat dad and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told her, she didn't know what the
hell a Rasta Jeff was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me, mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm harmless.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to talk about here in this
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got his hands on some of my art from
the dank team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I read genetic seeds are
available at thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a few things there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a deal for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spent so much money, you would get
some freebies of cookies and cream across
[SPEAKER_01]: to arise, which has been named to the
cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that they have that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can announce that I am in talks with a
new vendor and I will soon announce that
[SPEAKER_01]: vendor on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were looking for a new avenue
to acquire, I read genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a new vendor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get a shout out in the next
episode or the next two episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how things go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make any promises.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get that worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have another avenue for you to
get those beans and they will have the
[SPEAKER_01]: cream available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will have a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will have cascade.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have morning dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be several great things there if
we can work that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're down there in New Mexico where
Organica is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends, Tim and Charlie
and Charlie Jr. and everybody over at
[SPEAKER_01]: Organica.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of great folks over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to miss anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to stop with those
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the 30% arise and you're
hoping it comes through on the cookie
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will come through on the cookie cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some cream growing in another
room and it is frosty as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you may be able to pick up some
seeds at Organica in the very near future
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will have a rise and they will
have the cream and they will have morning
[SPEAKER_01]: dew and they will have firefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep your eyes out for that coming up
at Organica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, sometimes Organica sells clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may be able to go down there and
get a clone of the arise that is testing
[SPEAKER_01]: at over 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tested at 35% THC before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last couple tests have been closer to
32.
[SPEAKER_01]: They test every batch and they're getting
it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get those 35's consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But go down there and check for a clone or
call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they've got a clone for you down at
Organica.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to get clones at Organica,
try to get yourself a Zac Hayes clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant was bred in honor of our
friend, Zac, who passed away from cystic
[SPEAKER_01]: fibrosis and that plant grows like a
champ, smokes like a champ, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that it creates is potent and
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I want to keep moving with the
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm rambling today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said everything really does happen for
a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It truly does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything does happen for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you kind of asked me to talk a little
bit about my breeding, which is perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything does happen for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this at just the right time because
on Father's Day, I will be doing a little
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a room right now, I have got two arise
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two clones of it because I want
to make sure to have enough pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to sprinkle a ton of pollen in that
room, and I also want to collect a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of pollen to keep in a jar,
which we will talk about in a future
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got arise, a male in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is dumping pollen right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is dripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I have got, let's count,
there are approximately 20 females in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering room that will be ready to
receive pollen on the 18th of this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the 18th would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple days before, a couple days after
would not hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the 18th was the day that I
chose I wanted to do it, and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: Father's Day, so it's going to work out
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girls that will be in that room,
the female plants that are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's grateful dog in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arise to grateful dog makes morning
dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lemon skunk in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise to lemon skunk makes firefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, stuff I've never done.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a kalonji kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have kalonji kush cross to arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's capiltons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have capiltons cross to arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you what those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kalonji kush is Tahoe, OG, cross to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: The capilton is white widow cross to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to cross those to the arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of great things happening
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll put out some really cushy,
stanky phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that the arise male puts a
little more weight on both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The capilton already puts out huge buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious to see how big those buds are
going to get and what that might do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in that same room, there's a
redheaded stranger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way the redheaded stranger
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It branches out a little more than the
arise, which I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would kind of improve the structure of
the arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So arise and redheaded stranger,
I plan to call that red rocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a flow plant in there that will
take pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a platinum tangy,
a very small platinum tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make a few seeds to play
with it, see if I can find a very orange
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollination should happen around the
18th.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I could do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to think of a good name
for flow crossed to the arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to think of a word that means
like the upward flow of energy or uprising
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just said the word uprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something, so you guys, if you have any
suggestions to help me name flow to arise,
[SPEAKER_01]: flow is the girl, arise is the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tweet me at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
or on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of want to hear your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I'm talking about it,
white widow times arise needs a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's a white widow girl in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So white widow to arise needs a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already done that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just never bothered to name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown the seeds because I
haven't had room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I just run little tiny plants
for my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first breeding project, then I'll grow
them and see if they're worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll make a whole bunch more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same room for the breeding,
there is a female prodagium is how I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was bred by Colin Gordon of the ethos
collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very orangey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like a, like a orange cleaner
kind of a smell to it with a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know how a car tire shop or
anywhere you get your car worked on has
[SPEAKER_01]: like a hint of like an oil sort of a
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oranges and oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it in a sick way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a really great aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a prodagium in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Jeff's OG in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to need a name for Jeff's
OG to arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there's a Hell's OG in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be Hell's OG cross to arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I have a name for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certain yet, but I want to grow it
and see what it looks like, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I've got a cool name for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those will take pollen on the 18th ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to hit the plants with pollen
sometime around day 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little window between like day
23 and day 32 ish that they can take
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually about day 25 that most of
them really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do it when the pistols are nice
and fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will put the females,
different females in the room at different
[SPEAKER_01]: times to time them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just throw them all in there
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are kind of small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not huge plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to make a whole bunch of
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see what some new crosses
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm at it, I'm just repeating
some old crosses to make a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: seed stock for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to hit all the plants at the
same time on the 18th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll let them grow for about five
or six weeks and I'll start pulling out
[SPEAKER_01]: one seed from the bottom of each plant,
seeing how hard it is, how dark it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to see if it's getting tiger
striped.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's still white and soft, it's
obviously not done.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start getting hard, that's when
they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll flush them, cut down the plants,
let them dry, pull the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will test most of them myself
is how I usually do the first batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just run them myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes me a little while, but then I
find what I like and I make more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I make more, I usually throw a
couple of new things in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say I'm trying to make a whole bunch of
firefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a whole light of lemon skunk
females, but then I'll put one of
[SPEAKER_01]: something new in there that's never been
pollinated by the arise just so that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: create something new while I'm at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I make production plus a new
personal cross to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just try to keep things new.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, as a grower, you got to keep
it new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your mind excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your heart into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeps you passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm doing with my breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I answered your question there,
Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your long email was met with the long
reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've got time for one more
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is going to set me off on a long
rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will be back with an email
about traumatic brain injuries and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took way too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all sweaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I am red and I am sweating
behind my knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never felt the sweat behind my knee
before, but right now I can notice that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have never done that or
if I've just never noticed it or if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: finally just high enough to notice that,
but there's sweat back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing shorts and I'm still sweating
on my legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, before the break, I promised that
I would read an email about traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: brain injuries because if you've been a
longtime podcast listener, you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: in April of 2015, I experienced a
traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I simply hit my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit my head real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it in just the right spot and I
knocked myself clean the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave myself a subdural hematoma,
which is just a big word for I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: bruise on my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your brain and then there's a
pocket of fluid and then there's your
[SPEAKER_01]: skull and then there's your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bubble between the brain and that
layer of fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of acting funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was putting pressure on parts of my
brain that were making me say and think
[SPEAKER_01]: weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not suicidal at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really wanted to kill myself,
but during that brain injury, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: times when my brain was telling me that I
should hurt myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew better, but it was all related to a
brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was slowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't speak as well as normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to the podcast from that
time period, April of 2015, May of 2015,
[SPEAKER_01]: June 2015, I was goofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smacked the shit out of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do math properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't drive right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't write podcasts properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fucked up and it was making my
attitude bad and not being able to perform
[SPEAKER_01]: properly and remember a sentence and
remember what was happening was making me
[SPEAKER_01]: have weird thoughts of doing weird shit to
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: A traumatic brain injury can fuck your
life up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like shit for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I couldn't even tell what was
wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know which way was up,
which way was down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't thirsty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends would have to tell me to drink
water because my gums would just be stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: to my teeth like Fire Marshal Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Fire Marshal Bill had that dumb
expression where his teeth were just
[SPEAKER_01]: pasted or his gums were pasted to his
teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked like that and didn't even know it
because of a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: My little signals in my brain that would
say, hey dude, you're thirsty,
[SPEAKER_01]: that signal never went off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would sound like this on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be my mouth so dry that my
lips and teeth and my tongue were just all
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck as one piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even tell because I was broken
in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go outside and it was cold as fuck
and I wouldn't even have shoes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else would be shivering and cold
with a jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, oh, it's fine out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, you're fucking crazy and I
didn't get a cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get sick from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be times I would just be
sitting here at this table and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: forget where the fuck I was and what I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: There had been points on the podcast when
I was recording at that time where I had
[SPEAKER_01]: to stop and rewind and listen to what I
was saying and try to figure out what the
[SPEAKER_01]: hell I was even talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was broken from a traumatic brain
injury, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have recovered quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still problems in my body from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still problems in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the normal forgetful shit that
people get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the normal problems that people have
when you're like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also have other things that I can
tell are from the brain injury because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're new and they didn't happen before
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through weird attitude changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very impulsive for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was quite angry for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was honoring is the only word that I
could use to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just fucking with people and just
being a smart ass and just trolling
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all just from a brain injury just
triggering me to do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read books and talked to doctors and I
did all the right things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The books and the internet experiences
told me that there are phases you go
[SPEAKER_01]: through from a brain injury and I was
going through them properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I didn't have support from my friends
and the internet telling me that shit was
[SPEAKER_01]: going right, I would have been really
scared because not knowing there were
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of my life that are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the month after that, I probably only
know I could put together one full week of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit and I don't know the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be slightly a control freak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the boss at my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own my own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I host my own show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some control freak shit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not have that after my brain injury
and it really fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get to this person's email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just trying to let everybody know I
did have a serious brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk about this, I'm not talking
out my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was getting to, I just looped back
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I started saying something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like somebody had put my head on
the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, it fucking sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the pain set in on day two.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I hit my head, it didn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, what the fuck happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: My body and my brain weren't connecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day, it fucking hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally felt like I smacked my head
on the wall and I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a couple dabs and it made it hurt
worse because it increased my blood
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure and with that increased blood
pressure, I could just feel the head wound
[SPEAKER_01]: just going and I could fucking hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did not mention about my brain
injury and I don't like to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of bothers me and it embarrasses
me, but I love you guys and I think you
[SPEAKER_01]: love me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hear my voice get weird,
it's because I'm nervous about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear noise in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors say it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychologists know it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not fucking hiding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is noise in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like when you go to guitar
center and that kid doesn't know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: play the guitar and he plugs it in and
turns on the app and it goes, it's what it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, not always, but sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it sounds like when the air
conditioner is just real loud and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to hear your friend talk,
but the air conditioner is just going too
[SPEAKER_01]: loud or maybe the torch in the background
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hear sound like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in my head, just like that,
just constantly in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes and goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not constant, but when it starts,
it could last for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are effects like that that are still
happening in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dealing with it and I'm getting a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets better every day, I think,
but sometimes shit pops up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa dabs were making my head throb and
it was making that noise really loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer, Garden of Weed and Spencer and
Maddie, shout out to Spencer and Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to their house and they're like,
bro, you need some CBD in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, give me CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you think I need,
I will do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me a couple dabs of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the first dab, I described the pain
and it felt like I had a belt around my
[SPEAKER_01]: head or a vice around my head,
right around my temple region.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I took the dabs of CBD, it felt like
the belt loosened up a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just felt so the CBD was slowly making
it loosen up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read this email and then I'm
going to talk a lot more about my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis and a brain
injury and what I can recommend for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jeff, I hope all is well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No grow talk today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A more serious note, I'm hoping you can
provide me with some info or links as to
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits of cannabis and TBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: TBI is traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: A close friend of mine was in a motorcycle
accident and has a serious TBI and is
[SPEAKER_01]: being treated at Craig Hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would like to start using cannabis
medically for the TBI when he gets
[SPEAKER_01]: released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to grow some cannabis for him
to use, but have no idea what strains are
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial for TBI or what method of
ingestion is best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much appreciated and he signs his
name, which I'm not sure if he wants me to
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call you Eminem right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you have a name for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eminem, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the opportunity to talk about
something close to my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through my traumatic brain injury
recovery, things changed frequently and
[SPEAKER_01]: without warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first had the injury, CBD was what
I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD got me through the recovery and back
to my normal self.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made the swelling in my brain calm
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the swelling didn't go down
organically, there was going to have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a medical procedure done that would have
changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have fucked me up forever that I
would have been angry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be the same person right now
had that had to happen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have pissed me off so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduced the swelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduced the inflammation in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBD did that for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that went away, also let me add,
that while I was doing the CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was smoking CBD dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it was working for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, let me make a disclaimer just to
cover my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no medical training.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I have done myself and it
worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't take me as a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consult a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your friend has a traumatic brain
injury, go to all of the neurologist
[SPEAKER_01]: appointments that are required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share with your doctor that you are using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with whatever medicines they give
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be responsible with your medical
treatment, especially with a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot that can be done,
but go get checked out because you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have a stroke from shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other things that can lead that
can come from this and you need to be paid
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to by somebody that knows the
long-term side effects of a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably fucking obvious,
but I have to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be completely respectful to the
medical professionals that are treating
[SPEAKER_01]: you for this brain injury if you're going
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it and also I have to say it to
cover my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: What worked for me to start was CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also added a product and I don't work
for this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not pitching them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking a product called AlphaBrain
from Onnit, which Joe Rogan pitches all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Rogan eats AlphaBrain like they're
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having problems recalling
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having word association problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with my mom and there was a banana
on the counter and I wanted the banana,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I kept calling it a burrito.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Mom, will you pass me that
burrito?
[SPEAKER_01]: She looked on the counter and there was no
burrito, so she told me there's no burrito
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I can fucking see the burrito.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me that burrito and I pointed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she looked at me a little bit
concerned and she said, Jeff, do you mean
[SPEAKER_01]: this banana?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fuck, I do mean banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seriously saying burrito like I
meant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was mad at my mom for treating me like a
fool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when she realized you're broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: She thought I was exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her I hit my head, knocked myself
clean out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, whatever, boys will be boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't take it as seriously as she
should have until that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she turned a little pale and she
realized my kid's fucking broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when people started taking me a
little more seriously about my broken
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, but I was having word association
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started taking AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They recommend two a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking four a day because I'm like
that, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say take two, it'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take fucking four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the school I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one rapid duct tape will fix it,
the whole damn roll ought to fix it real
[SPEAKER_01]: good is the way I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking four AlphaBrain and honestly,
I don't work for that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is serious testimony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it sped me up because of the
time without it and the time with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I started taking it, shit started
coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Routines and patterns and my daily,
what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got dreadlocks that hang to my butt
and I tie them in a knot on my head in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very particular way that I've been doing
for, I've had these dreads for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been tying them like that since they
could reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't figure out how to do it after I
hit my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine not knowing how to, basically
something you do every day, probably tie
[SPEAKER_01]: your shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us just cut off our shoes,
fucking lazy tied.
[SPEAKER_01]: All mine are lazy tied so I can slip them
on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of shit that you do
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brush your teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you woke up tomorrow morning
and you just looked at your toothbrush and
[SPEAKER_01]: your toothpaste and you're like,
I kinda, I sorta have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just stuck it in your mouth and
poked your cheek a couple times and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, nope, that's not what I do with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta think about it and figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't figure out how to tie up my own
dreadlocks and I've been doing it twice a
[SPEAKER_01]: day for the past 10 years and I couldn't
figure out how to fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alpha brain made stuff like that start
flowing back into my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed an appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bern from the grow store called me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, hey, there's somebody here
that says you promised you would meet them
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember making an
appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I started taking the alpha
brain, that phone call where I made that
[SPEAKER_01]: appointment and booked that, that came
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD and alpha brain are what put me on
the path to recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the CBD stopped working and it
made me lethargic and lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that sounds weird, but I'm an
energetic peppy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell by how much I fucking talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually up first and I'm up last also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to bed last and I wake up first and I
smoke more dabs and I crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of fucking work in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CBD was making me lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started shifting myself to high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs and then the distillate started
coming around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when like the 98 and 97 and 99%
THC distillates started coming around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started dabbing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that super high doses of THC
through a dab would make the noise in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would make the, the uncomfortable
out of focus feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make that go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be able to, and I know this
sounds really weird, but I would be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to focus and function a little better when
I smoked a super high THC dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can tell that my brain is getting
much better and much more healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought patterns are much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like they used to be again.
[SPEAKER_01]: My paragraphs, when I write a podcast or
when I write an email, my paragraphs are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually fucking paragraphs again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a beginning, a middle and an end
when I'm telling a story now, back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, I would just ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm noticing is now that my brain
is not injured so much, I'm getting really
[SPEAKER_01]: high when I smoke good.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are days when I can tell my brain is
a little funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you guys can tell when I
record also, when I have a funky brain day
[SPEAKER_01]: and people around me can tell,
but the people that know me, they know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they know that I'm staying away from
them because I'm having a funky brain day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the funky brain days, if I dip high
THC shatter into really limonene dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: turps, my head troubles, just chill the
fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really lucky that I figured that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took talking to a few people with
head injuries and it took a lot of buying
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoking of a lot of shit to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know exactly what's gonna work
for your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD should work in the beginning to help
reduce the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes when you've got a brain
injury or any kind of swelling on the
[SPEAKER_01]: body, too much THC will make your heart
race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll just make that bruised area,
that injured area, it'll just make it
[SPEAKER_01]: throb and swell.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more and it'll make it hurt
and make it uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that gets to your head and then
it makes it hurt more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets to your head again and it
makes it hurt more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a fucked up hour and a half of
being high and in unnecessary pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're gonna smoke CBD, if he is
gonna smoke CBD, I would recommend THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me restart that whole fucking
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your friend with a traumatic brain
injury is going to choose to smoke THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: go light in the beginning because it may
increase the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend starting off with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's been smoking, if he's already a
cannabis user, if he's already a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, a pothead, whatever, go heavy
with the CBD treatments and he'll be just
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how that does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's working, do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go harder if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how he feels about edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The edibles are gonna come on a lot
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna last a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So smoke a little CBD, see how you like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if it's working, start doing edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm saying, eventually maybe that CBD
is gonna wear off.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the brain injury progresses,
this is what worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then shift to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that THC isn't working, smoke CBD
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just balance it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have to experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna be a guinea pig because his
motherboard is broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the computer doesn't work the way it
should anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the things that should work for
him aren't going to and the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would never think would work might
because the computer's been a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: reprogrammed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be patient with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a friend, just be there for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna say some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just listen and just don't scare him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't point it out because it used to fuck
with me when my friends would be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, you're acting retarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make me feel weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just treat him right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure the dude's not suicidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after a brain injury, suicidal
thoughts creep into your head because you
[SPEAKER_01]: have, I try to find, is this the
appropriate word of retarded?
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel retarded because you are
retarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your thought process has been retarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you feel retarded and you lose
confidence in yourself and your life isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it puts the thought in the back of your
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm gonna feel like this every day and
be retarded, I might just not have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure your friend doesn't get in
that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lucky that I've got great friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends love me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom loves me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody kept a good eye on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was not even a fucking option for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does happen with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it in football players,
sports folks, athletes who get traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: brain injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill themselves a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because your brain is so fucked
up, you can't think right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The motherboard is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CD is skipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta find a way to stop the CD from
skipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, some suicide is a way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something you could really do is
just be there for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he was in a motorcycle accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is probably going to be some PTSD
involved in an accident, involved in a
[SPEAKER_01]: motorcycle, involved in the sounds of a
motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be gentle with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My traumatic brain injury was caused by a
fucking doorway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm six and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this old part of town, it was built by
old people from different descent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only know the... We have a derogatory
word for them that everybody just uses
[SPEAKER_01]: here like it's fucking normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even them, they made it up, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: People of Slavic descent built small
houses in this old part of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the doorways are low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to go through a Slovenian
doorway and I'm a German boy and it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ka-pow!
[SPEAKER_01]: I was knocked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I am at work in the grow,
and I'm standing up, if I kneel down to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick something up when I stand up,
I stand up really slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after about my fourth day there,
one of my coworkers is like, bro,
[SPEAKER_01]: why do you stand up like that when you
kneel down?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I have a traumatic brain
injury and I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, oh fuck yeah, that only
takes one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all realized why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they watch me like, they notice that
I'm keeping my head safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after one, I don't want to do it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if my brain could take it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not survive that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when I was younger, I've been
trained in karate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some karate experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some tournaments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in an exhibition team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kicked people in the head,
you guys, in tournaments, not in
[SPEAKER_01]: tournaments.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I never want to do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I've ever kicked you in the head,
I'm fucking sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only imagine what I did to your
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: My eggs are scrambled and I hope I didn't
do that to anybody in a fight,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a tournament, in the street,
protecting myself, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, don't ever kick anybody in the
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to get in a fight,
fucking put them on the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: make them tap out or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hit anybody in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear a helmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am really rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody that sent me
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to Saint Skinny
and Skinny Mom or Saint Mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call you Skinny Mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a fucking good compliment
for anybody's mom, Skinny Mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send some love and energy to that whole
family if they need some support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it sounds like our friend Eminem's
buddy could use a little bit of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send some love and light that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect your head, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading this about the traumatic brain
injury really got me riled up and got me
[SPEAKER_01]: ranting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say you want to grow some cannabis for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need something with high CBD,
I can probably recommend Tora Bora from
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA Genetics, Pennywise from TGA Subcool
Seeds, and there are probably tons of
[SPEAKER_01]: other high CBD strains out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to reach out to somebody
on the Facebook community and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram community, and you may be able
to find free seeds that are high in CBD if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reach out to me if you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do what we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you said what strains are beneficial
and what method of ingestion is best?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start with smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your friend has been a smoker before,
roll him a joint, load him a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's been a heavy smoker before,
I keep saying he.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a she.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine was in an accident and
had ... He said he.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be sexist on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's a smoker before, give him a dab
because I think a dab is good because you
[SPEAKER_01]: see immediate results.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take a dab of it, you're going to
get the results immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll know if it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll know if it doesn't, and then you
can go from there quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: With flowers, it's going to take a few
more inhales depending on the person's
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance, but I would start with flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out how those work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then switch to concentrates or edibles
just to be able to deliver the medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: more properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do make a patch if you're in a
medicinal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said treated at a Craig hospital,
possibly Craig, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patches are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The transdermal patches, the CBD patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put those wherever it hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can put them on your
head if you've got hair, but maybe on your
[SPEAKER_01]: lower neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that would work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to start out with smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking works right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's the easiest to shake off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you eat edibles, it's going to last a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a dab, it's going to last a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take one or two puffs off a pipe
and it goes the wrong way, it's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a long time to get that out of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches, maybe something to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be just fine pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't be too uncomfortable for most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: M&M, I hope I was able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're able to get started growing
for your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if you need help finding CBD
seeds, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a few people that may be able to
donate a 10 pack of seeds to you just to
[SPEAKER_01]: get you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like your friend needs some help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I want to give you a shout out for
reaching out to me to help your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some good friend shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need, more friends like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everything goes well with your
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope he recovers well from the traumatic
brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want more interaction about this
TBI, if you'd like to talk to me more
[SPEAKER_01]: about it just because I've been there,
like I said, I'm not a doctor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you or your friend would like to reach
out and talk to me about it, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like sharing my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm passionate about it, so don't be shy.

[SPEAKER_00]: Lord, you can see that it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could pass his time around some other
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know he charts this place beside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, there's nothing you can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing that you need to add or do of

[SPEAKER_00]: Lord, you can see that it's true.
