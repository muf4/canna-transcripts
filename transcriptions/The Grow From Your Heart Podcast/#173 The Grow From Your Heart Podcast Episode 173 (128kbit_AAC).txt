Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koo, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I plan this right, this will be coming
out right at the start of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to wish everybody a Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope 2016 was perfect for you,
but I hope 2017 is even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great shit lined up for
myself in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got good things lined up for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have great stuff lined up for
iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything goes your way in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening
all the way through 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 173 episodes in, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for joining me on
this journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to
my friend the dabbing granny and all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that joined us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little private party just a few
days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all met up somewhere and we hung out
and took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people there,
so I'm going to miss a few people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to mention my new friend,
Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Jerry listens to the
podcast yet, but I made a new friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a wonderful companion animal with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dog is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also met your better half, but I cannot
think of her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure we were properly introduced,
but I'm glad that I finally got to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of cool stuff about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honor and a pleasure to meet Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the party, there was Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, of course, the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lovely Camille was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC Samuel was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobo Blasterco was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay the traveling stoner was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a young man who I never caught
his name, but he gave me a dab that we
[SPEAKER_00]: will talk about in just a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even try to go through the list of
all the people that were at the little
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering that I participated in,
but I want to give the dabbing granny a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge shout out for inviting me to the
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a gram dab together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised everybody on Instagram that if
I got up to 10,000 Instagram followers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a one gram dab with the dabbing
granny, and it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me a damn grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty much a damn grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me a gram dab of OG Cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nail cooled down a little bit too
quickly for me to get the whole dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all the distillate hit the nail,
because I just squirted that sucker on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it hit the nail, it kind of cooled
down, but I took a dab like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big shout out to all the people
that went to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of these dabs I
took, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a gram dab of OG Cush Distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heated the nail real hot, and then the
distillate comes in like a... It is a
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe, you guys, but when I say the word
syringe, people get freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glass syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a syringe, but it does not have the
tip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the pokey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't poke anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like a syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like something you would use to
feed a baby bird, is what I think it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be best described as.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little syringe, it's got distillate
in it, raw distillate, which was... Let me
[SPEAKER_00]: turn on the music, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distillate is probably 90% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of flavor to it,
but you put in these little glass
[SPEAKER_00]: syringes, and it's kind of hard to get
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit it with a torch for a couple of
seconds to heat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I heat the nail, and the heat from
the dab nail and the heat that I applied
[SPEAKER_00]: with my dab torch worked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pressed the tip of the glass
syringe onto the dab nail, and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed the plunger of that syringe down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a second to get it going,
but once it released, almost all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab went onto the nail immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just... Just one big gush of liquid
dabs onto the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all that smoke in my brain,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one big rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took two or three breaths to clear the
whole thing, but I got most of the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: in one big rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to my brain immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG Kush made me melt into the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt my butt grew roots, and I became
part of that couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to set the rig down, and I
immediately had to stand up and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, I have to walk around,
because if I sit here, I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: nap at this private party, where they are
not going to appreciate my giant six foot
[SPEAKER_00]: five size, and I'm going to take a nap and
snore like an angry bear, because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a hibernation if I laid down
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wrecked high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked around for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's a video of this on the
Dab and Granny's Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure she did it on Facebook
Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it was Facebook Live, because
anything else, it disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably there on Facebook Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out the Dab and
Granny's Facebook Live, look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, look at the Dab and Granny's
Facebook Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on her Instagram, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on her Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dab and Granny's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't post Dab videos to my Instagram,
because the Instagram police have been
[SPEAKER_00]: shutting down Instagram accounts in the
cannabis community for random reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do not want to lose my account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see many smoking videos of me,
but you will see some wonderful cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post great pictures of male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post great pictures of my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial grows that I help in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post pictures there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The places I go consult, I'll take a nice
picture from there sometimes, but I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: post many pictures of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post pictures of myself consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this grand dab of distillate,
and I was high as giraffe pussy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was spinning around, I was floating,
but I was in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people probably would have laid on
the couch and taken a four or five hour
[SPEAKER_00]: nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to stand up, walk around,
keep myself social, and keep moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was okay with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I stayed moving, stayed bouncy,
I was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several minutes after I took that Dab,
another guy whose name I did not catch,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a beautiful Dab Rig, a super
colorful mini tube with a donut shape on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking gorgeous Rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never caught the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good time together, but I never
caught your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're listening, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a Dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you guys, the guy I'm talking
to gave me a Dab of 99.9% THC Isolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Isitol, I've heard it called also,
but it was basically just THC crystals in
[SPEAKER_00]: a crystal form, not like crystals like
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call THC crystals just the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it's got a lot of crystals,
but this was a crystalline form of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have extracted everything and just
have THC in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like salt or sugar chunks or
other drugs in a little container,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he just sprinkled a little bit of it
into the Dab nail, and it didn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it went in my lungs, I could feel
there was some smoke in my lungs or some
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor, I guess it would be, in my lungs,
but I really didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't feel normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't feel like when you smoke
flowers, it didn't feel like when I take a
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab, there was no chest expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a Dab, I feel my chest expand
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the smoke wanting to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This THC Dab was super smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at him like, I didn't notice a
damn thing, and he nodded.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you blow that out, you're going to
get fucked up, and I started to blow it
[SPEAKER_00]: out, and when my body made... So guys,
I don't know if everybody else does this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I'm about to exhale, my lips make
a certain thing so that I can exhale at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right speed so that I don't go and
just blow all the air out at once and
[SPEAKER_00]: choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of... What's the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: You parse your lips a little bit,
and you blow it like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're blowing up a balloon,
you make a certain face.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're blowing out a Dab,
you make a certain shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I made those muscles to make my
lungs, my lips prepared to blow out the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab, I felt how high I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, and I was like, oh God,
there it is, and I felt my face turn red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel my eyes droop, and that dude
goes, yeah, you've noticed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and granny goes, that's good shit,
isn't it, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't answer her properly as I
blew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arm hair was standing up and moving
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nipples were hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I take a giant Dab,
it works well and makes my nips get all
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nips were diamond cutters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was intoxicated for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to kind of chill out for a second
and get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude had a gorgeous rig, but it had a
donut shape, at the bottom of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he had a nice banger on it,
but I couldn't tell you much more about
[SPEAKER_00]: that rig, other than my brain remembers
that it was colorful and gorgeous,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can't even remember the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how good that Dab was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good at absorbing names and
putting names with faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's fucking face and name,
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I remember is the Dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how tremendous that Dab was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, let's see, what else did I
consume at the little party there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Caleb from Shoemit brought some
Shoemit bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never tried the red velvet bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brag all, or I boast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I love that banana pudding bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the red velvet bar is every bit
as good, although I'm a banana fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the banana more, but that red
velvet, I think it's red velvet cake or
[SPEAKER_00]: red velvet, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed around a couple candy bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a couple pieces of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time everything kicked in,
I was well-medicated for the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I've just been bragging about
all the cool shit I got to smoke and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wanted to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke OG Kush Distil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a Gram Dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke probably a .2 or a .3 of
99% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we took 10 or 20
normal shatter dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny had some lemon shatter that was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Lindsay and Bobo had some tangy
shatter that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that showed up had some great
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give Granny a big,
huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny put the whole party together.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made sure everybody showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a place put together for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to the
place that let us have our little
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure we were supposed to be
smoking so many dabs and flowers in that
[SPEAKER_00]: place, but we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we also smoked a bunch of great
flour in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you guys, I normally don't smoke a
bunch of flour, but I took some great
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that I grew, and I was sharing
those with my friends, and people were
[SPEAKER_00]: really pleased with my most recent
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody that made it to
the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm giving shout outs, I want to
give a huge shout out to my friend Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tater came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's huge, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tater Glass is a glass artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has made me a couple few custom glass
pencils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm holding my... This is
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what type of green this is,
but it has a red, yellow, and green
[SPEAKER_00]: wigwag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more wig than wag to it at the
tip, or at the pencil, or at the eraser
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the writing tip, it is red,
gold, and green, rasta colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great-looking pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the eraser end where the eraser would
be, you guys, it has got a lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys would call it a milli.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it actually is a marina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greeny, but it's a great-looking lion on
the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pencil from my friend Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got this blue pencil from
Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it is clear, and it's got some
glacier blue on one end, and with a cobalt
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other end, with a cobalt blue,
glacier blue swirl on the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great-looking pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got this green one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this might be Haterade or Green
Stardust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got some purple on both tips of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet pencils, because I'm not even sure
what half of these colors that these glass
[SPEAKER_00]: artists use are called anymore,
because they are making more colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's no purple or blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like plum or blue stardust,
and red is called Red Elvis, so the color
[SPEAKER_00]: names are pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't call it the right name,
a glass artist will fucking correct you
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I want to give Tater an extra
huge shout-out is because right around
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas, I got an idea that I should get
one more gift for somebody, and I decided
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to get them a custom-made
Tater Glass pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept talking about wanting something
sparkly, green and glass, and I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get a sparkly green glass Tater
pencil, so I was able to get a Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardust and Blue Glacier Tater Glass
pencil with a Grateful Dead bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are calling them Millies,
but I think they're Marinies, but it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: a Grateful Dead Marini or a Millie at the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to my buddy Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only Instagram friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be real friends, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get together and use these
pencils that we've got and take some fat
[SPEAKER_00]: globs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout-out to my friend Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it really quickly after I asked
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shipped it the next day, and it got to
me within two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mad love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there is some real content to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a huge topic to talk about,
but you know how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get that far, I've got to do one
super-duper important ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout-out to my
friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some shirts printed,
if you need hoodies printed, if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: some stickers made, if you need some
hatpins designed, my friends at Handmade
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparel can take care of all of your
custom printing needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to do is visit

[SPEAKER_00]: It's adam at handmadeapparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you will be impressed,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They handle all of my printing because
they're the ones who I trust, and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: super picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super meticulous about how things are
done, and I really like the way that these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've got these grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logos are so fresh on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away when I opened them out of
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and Lindsey came by and picked up
theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super proud and super impressed
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few left.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were interested in a grow from your
heart podcast hoodie, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to tell you how to get one of
these hoodies in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we need to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: My breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys love it when I give you breeding
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually gotten emails saying what
happened to the breeding updates because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do it on every episode, so let's
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is probably day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day that I am recording is 60 days
into flower on a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were hit with pollen around
... It was around day 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember off the top of my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 25 days into flower,
those plants received pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now 60 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, every couple of days,
I will go take one seed from a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a random plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a method to my madness,
but I'll pick a plant and I will pull a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed from near the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling one seed off, I can see the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're swelling up in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pull one off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of days ago, I pulled one seed
out of flow and the seed was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside was the right color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside was the right texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I squeezed it and I could feel that it was
a little bit soft, so it wasn't fully
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took my fingernail to crack this shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used my thumbnail and got through the
shell and I could tell that the inside was
[SPEAKER_00]: very white and the seed was not quite
done, but we are very few days away from
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds being ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding project is almost completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stopped feeding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just getting clean water now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just get clean water for the next
few days until I do cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of material there,
but the leftover material will get turned
[SPEAKER_00]: into shatter so that we could smoke some
dabs out of the stuff that is left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon, there will be new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing within the next five to 10
days, those plants will get cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hang upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut off all the large leaves very
soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hang them upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let them get really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will just lay them in long
Tupperware dishes is what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut them into little sections in lamb
and Tupperware dishes and just let them
[SPEAKER_00]: get real dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the buds start crumbling up and the
seeds start falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I have some spare time,
I just sit there with some rubber gloves,
[SPEAKER_00]: like these black nitrile gloves,
sit there with those on and just crunch up
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the seeds fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just tip the container to one side
and all the seeds roll to one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bud material stays at the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in a labeled jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what will happen is I'll leave them
open for, since they sat out for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, they'll probably be plenty dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any moisture in those seeds,
I'll leave them open, but I'll seal them
[SPEAKER_00]: up and let them sit for a few days and
think about who I want to give them to so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can have some of my friends grow
out seeds out in little tiny pots and they
[SPEAKER_00]: look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of an update on the breeding
project, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nearly done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are getting hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five to 10 days and I will be cutting them
down and then they'll dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another five to 10 days from there,
I'll start pulling the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another five to 10 days from there,
I'll start giving seeds out to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully five to 10 days from there,
people have shit germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hopefully 120 days from there,
we've got pictures and flowers to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that kind of stuff so that we can
see what the crop did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my breeding update.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to do, you guys,
once a month, I like to go and read these
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes comments because if I let them go
for more than a month, I seem to forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the month of December, I received two
iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you want to go to iTunes,
all you have to do is go to the iTunes
[SPEAKER_00]: store, go to the podcast tab, search for
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you just go to iTunes that says
library, unplayed and store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the store, search in Grow From Your
Heart, find the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my face on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you know what it looks like by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the ratings and review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the option right here to
give me some stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give me as many stars as you feel
I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, ladies and gentlemen, 41 people
have given me a five-star review and 35
[SPEAKER_00]: people have left a written review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read the two most recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a person who called
themselves JJ OliveOil08.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left it on December 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, Jeff is a very positive guy
with so many informative things to say
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing and the rest of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hearing that I'm a positive guy and
my goal is to be informative with shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: say about growing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excellent, great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I got five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment comes from a person that
calls himself SamS37.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, thanks Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that weird they said
accent came from, but that was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, I've learned a ton from Jeff
and the awesome guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing your knowledge with the
community and helping make the world a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're learning from me and my
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal is to teach some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm able to share this knowledge
with my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes a community is sharing,
bringing everybody together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right, we are making the world
a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making cannabis better, which makes
people less grumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them less sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more people have cannabis,
the better the world is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will keep fighting the good fight as
long as I am able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the review, SamS37.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I truly appreciate all of the
iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, 35 positive reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody had some bad shit to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five star ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you want to leave me a
rating in a review, I would completely
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something to say and you
don't want to say it here on iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're not an iTunes user or
listener, you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I want to give one
shout out, which is going to lead into the
[SPEAKER_00]: main topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do it, I feel like I've been
talking for a long time and I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: talking very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for one
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take two dabs and then I'm
going to take a drink of some tasty
[SPEAKER_00]: gingerade kombucha and I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't even notice I took a
break because there's just going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little brrra brrra brrra sound and I'll be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I told you I'd be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heavily medicated now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some dabs of Cascade in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just drank some frosty cold GTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the gingerade kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do throw it away when I get to
that bottom booger because I just can't
[SPEAKER_00]: handle that chunky shit at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have to talk shit, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't handle that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this GTs is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there is a point to this podcast,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a shout out that will
lead me into this point of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm adjusting my headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my shit back together after
that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head is spinning a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, I say the word spliff kind of
oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do word well with the SPL sound
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to end it with two F's fucks me
up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spliff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a podcast that I've been listening
to called the spliff podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She spells it podcast POTC AST.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spliff podcast is a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to it for 50
something, probably 60 episodes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am completely caught up and it is a
great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some high and I'm recommending it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously, if you like my podcast,
you will enjoy the spliff podcast hosted
[SPEAKER_00]: by I'm going to call her my new friend,
Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to her for 60
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we are buddies now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just a dab away from being BFFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these days she's going to come
to Colorado because I hate traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't travel well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some dabs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, Bo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out with Miss Jenny Beth and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a spot for you at the dab table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll record a podcast together and we can
both release it at the same time and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can just do a dual episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your audience can be introduced to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll introduce you to my audience if they
haven't already heard you and we'll get it
[SPEAKER_00]: going like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But come take a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, Bo does a lot of talk about
very specific cannabinoid dosing and
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strains and very specific stuff
for medicine for patients, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely respect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sometimes I do not completely
agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's okay to disagree with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at you, Bo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying sometimes I don't
completely agree, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are too focused on
lab tests and they're not following their
[SPEAKER_00]: own body, their own intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's the dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Toucan Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to say, follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to cannabis and
selecting cannabis that will work for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe that follow your nose
because it always knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab tests are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't believe 50% of the lab
tests that I see because I just saw a 34%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC test for a strain that I think is
bullshit, but that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow your nose over the lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like strains that get your
attention are probably good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your body craves salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably needing salt or you're
thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll be at the grocery store
and you can look at the fruit and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see seven different kinds of delicious
fruit, but one of them calls your name or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's a vegetarian vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something calls your name and it just
jumps out and you're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to eat some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like your body is programmed to let
you know what you want and what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes you think when you're
thirsty, your body goes, I'm thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you recognize that because you're
lacking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you need some vitamin C and
you're walking through the grocery store,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see oranges and your eyes
are going to go, that's the thing right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also why I think poop stinks
because you're not supposed to eat poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you believe in nature,
jaw, God, whoever created us made it
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our poop stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we desire the stuff that our body
needs because we're supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cannabis smells good because
we're supposed to be consuming it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to support my statement, I think
physically people who are related don't
[SPEAKER_00]: find each other's pheromones attractive
because we're not supposed to be mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too close in bloodline to get
together, if you're family, you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be turned on by somebody's scent,
which sounds weird, but we are attracted
[SPEAKER_00]: to pheromones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you'll smell somebody of the
opposite sex and you will want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too close to you, you're
genetically programmed to not find their
[SPEAKER_00]: smell attractive so that you don't hit on
your cousin is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our bodies know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies give us signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm really getting at is I think
that the medicine, the cannabis that calls
[SPEAKER_00]: at you has probably got something in it
that you need to be consuming or that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of what makes me think this,
I've been helping out in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I bounce around from grow to
grow, but I've been in another grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend James is constantly walking
to two very specific plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: James is from the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a strain called Recon in one of
the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since James is from the South,
he calls it Recon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just let James call it Recon because I
mean, he's James.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do for the old
Southern boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: But Recon always gets his attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves the way Recon smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four rooms in this facility and
they're all in different stages of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put James in there and you go
walk to a plant, you'll always watch him
[SPEAKER_00]: walk over to the Recon and just give it a
smell and stand by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another strain in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Banana Split.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows these big purple buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gorgeous, but it's got a smell that
James can't stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put him in the room to defoliate or
do work, he always ends up working on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Recon or a Banana Split plant because they
call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's something in there that
James needs, like either recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it is, but it's
calling him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's something in that
plant that James needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If James is going to consume cannabis,
it should be one of those strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: calls his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to be, he might not
be sick, but that's going to be the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the most healing and the most
therapeutic for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly recommend that he try some
of that stuff when it's ready and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some more things that I can
support my statement that our nose
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates which cannabis is best for us
with my own experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about me,
if you pay attention to my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, a lot of my breeding leans
toward the lemony flavored Sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like high THC content and I like a
really lemony flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy a citrusy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've noticed when I smoke stuff
with an orange flavor, tangerine haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy, the orange creamsicle, orange
dreamsicle, agent orange, anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: that orange turp to it, it's a very mellow
yet uplifting sort of good mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: good vibe sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oranges is always like an
anxiety-free, mellow, chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it kind of a breakfast high.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing, I like to handle my
business in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my emails, I do my phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any stuff that's going to require a lot of
like clarity, I try to get it done before
[SPEAKER_00]: I end up taking my lunchtime dabs because
at lunchtime we get down for some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to get, if I'm going to smoke in
the morning, I like to have something a
[SPEAKER_00]: little lighter if that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jilly Bean is a great breakfast dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke something like Jack
Herrera or Jack the Ripper first thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to just kind of fuck up my
whole flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be off kilter all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be a little anxious because when you
get that high in the morning, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I fuck stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave something at home or I'll leave
something on and leave and go all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to work or you'll do that thing where you
put the gas pump in the car and drive away
[SPEAKER_00]: with the pump in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that, but that's the kind
of shit I feel like I could do if I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: too strong of a sativa in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get my head on straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start off with that,
that orangey turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just talked myself back to where
I was because I fucking lost track of
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was, but I found it, you guys,
so you can't make fun of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those orangey turps are always like
mellow and uplifting and a smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always make me kind of smile,
put me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always what I've noticed from
orangey turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon turps, it makes my head spin and it
makes me motivated and it makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do these podcasts, I like to
smoke heavy sativa dominant lemon flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get right to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm smoking Cascade, which is bred
by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lemon skunk female that was
pollinated by a daybreaker male and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: using phenotype, which was known as B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the really lemony, it smells like
dish soap, honestly, you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why I named it Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cascade, the feeling of something coming
over you, like the waterfall of this
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that happens when you dab it,
it's the Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also smells like lemon dish
soap, which is Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called it Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it makes me talkative and
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my version of alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan takes 17 alpha brain before a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke six dabs of Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really feel like these lemon turps
keep me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do battle some, my brain is mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I hit my head a long time ago
and my mood swings a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get pissy sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a few Cascade dabs, I forget what I
was mad about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like the high sativa,
the lemon turps work well for my body
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I'm going to say that
supports my statement, this may sound
[SPEAKER_00]: racist, but it's not racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a geographical thing that I feel
like I have discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I live, we have a high population of
Mexican and Hispanic heritage people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people here have people,
bloodlines straight to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most popular strains to ever
come around, where I live, you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very heavily Mexican populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, we got some sour diesel
here and it has not gone away since then
[SPEAKER_00]: because the Mexican people here love sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smell that sour diesel smell down
the block, if you burn some sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Mexican heritage person will ask you for
some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, in 2017, I don't fucking know if
it's racist to call somebody a Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people that have their families
from Mexico and they got Mexican blood in
[SPEAKER_00]: them, that is a Mexican person to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the other word.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a better word I should be
using, fucking tell me, I'll use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I need to make a correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said pheromones of somebody from
the opposite sex could get your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pheromones from fucking anybody could get
your attention now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if that was offensive as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to be more sensitive to
that sort of thing without overdoing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it could be the same sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to be racist with the
Mexican word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that the Mexican people
around here love to smoke sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory, I could be wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Rasta Jeff's theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been doing this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mexican people here love sour diesel
almost more than any other strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Mexican that sour diesel is a
chem dog crossed to a Mexican sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there is a heavy Mexican sativa genetic
in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that Mexican sativa is what
causes that skunky smell, that real skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: funk, pungent odor that almost tends to
lean to the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a Mexican sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that since that Mexican sativa
plant and the Mexican people come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same spot on the planet, they are getting
a stronger benefit and a stronger desire
[SPEAKER_00]: for that plant because it's geographically
from where they're from in their body,
[SPEAKER_00]: their history.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about where they are,
something in that sour diesel plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to benefit their life because of
their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something in their body
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something in their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's pre-programmed in
their memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to back it up with
science or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just my opinion and my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole point here is that I feel like
your body, your nose, your mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: your senses are probably the best judge of
what cannabis is best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do respect the lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate the idea of a lab
test, but please do not let that lab test
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin your idea of a certain strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a strain gets your attention,
if you have two strains sitting next to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and you have a lab test for
both of them and you can smell both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, if one has great lab tests and one
smells better, get the one that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's properly trimmed and cured and
grown properly, if they're both top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, get the one that smells better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost guarantee you're going to
have more pleasure from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I want to add to this 30
minute rant about selecting your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains via your nose instead of your lab
test, don't discredit a strain because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've tried it once from one grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear people say, oh, I hate whatever
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the quality of a flower you
purchase can vary widely on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain for very many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I'm trying to get this all
through my brain and to you clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any notes on this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow some flowers and Jessie grows
some flowers and my girl Jenny grows some
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, they're all three going to come
out different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow with botanic care nutrients
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jessie grows with organic nutrients in a
light depth greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say she grows in a tent
with synthetic newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our stuff is going to come out
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have a clone of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab testing will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavors will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid profile will be a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out differently because
of the different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be different phenotypical
expressions, which also leads me to
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody selected a shitty phenotype
of that strain for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they got a 10 pack of seeds and they
chose the one that grows short and stout
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would have preferred the one that
grows tall and skinny, but that's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't get a good representation of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't discredit something just because you
didn't like it the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Jenny grew it, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Jessie grew it, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grew it, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like Jenny's style better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like Jessie's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like mine better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to find, give a strain a
couple of tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gives you a headache or a panic
attack or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see why you'd avoid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not go for it a second try,
but if you just didn't like it for some
[SPEAKER_00]: weird reason, give it another shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be discrediting yourself on
something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus more on the effects of the cannabis,
how much it draws you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab tests are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really like a lab test for is now
they are showing pesticides and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my concentrates, I can see how many
residual solvents are in my dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see how much pesticide is in my
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being able to see that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like seeing it when things test
really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk in the future about
actual lab test numbers because people see
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and THCA and they're not sure which
ones to brag about on the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that a little
bit in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more note that I added to this that I
want to make sure I cover before I move on
[SPEAKER_00]: from the lab test versus your senses is
that the labs are all calibrated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those machines have the same base
and the same ... I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: same standard is, what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran the same THC through that machine
to set a standard for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies are not calibrated the exact
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body chemistry is going to play a huge
role in what cannabis works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab tests are great, but your body
chemistry, your nose, your eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: your mouth, hopefully your ears aren't
involved too much in selecting your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis unless you heard of a killer
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you feel, all of that stuff should be
a huge decision maker for your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust in the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all those tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what kind of pesticides are in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe here's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find some strains that you like and
you can find lab testing on all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that is slightly consistent, find what is
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the common thread through those tests
and then maybe you can start looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: more strains like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I believe that we're going
to have tailor-made cannabis dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to go get a tailor-made,
the perfect amount of Terps, the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cannabinoids, the right amount
of each cannabinoid, however you want it,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever ratios you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to get a pill probably made
for yourself that you can swallow and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is your perfect cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start looking now at those lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the little chart that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find all those common threads and you'll
be ahead of the game when that time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, just a few seconds ago, I was
talking about strains that give me panic
[SPEAKER_00]: attacks in the morning and strains that I
like to smoke at certain times of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was outlining this episode,
I decided to make a short list of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called them low panic strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got jilly bean written down as a
low panic strain, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangerine haze is a low panic strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy is a low panic strain, in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things, in my opinion,
that do not cause panic and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sativa kind of strains that put
a smile on my face and put a little pep in
[SPEAKER_00]: my step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got to do dishes, if you have to
vacuum the house, these are the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: strains for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep you moving and they don't seem
to mess up my focus and ruin my plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I smoke something too sativa
heavy first thing in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, a big fat joint of lemon
jeffery first thing in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not get the right things done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get some shit done, but it will not
be what was on the to-do list at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something will get cleaned that did not
need to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff with the orange turps, I think,
are great for the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things to avoid if you get panicky,
strains I would stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper, way too sativa dominant
for your head first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vortex, Space Queen, way too much for your
head first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel, way too much for most people
first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get panicky, stay away from the
Sour Diesel, the Vortex, the Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper, the Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay away from that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the giggles, something that is
often given a lot of people the giggles is
[SPEAKER_00]: the LA Confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a really indica dominant
LA Confidential, smoke on that and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some CBN Shatter a few days ago
with a couple friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find products that are high in
CBN, you will get the Munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that dab and by the time I was done
blowing the dab out, I wanted to eat the
[SPEAKER_00]: rig and the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to eat everything inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBN is good if you're trying to get
hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to think of things that'll
help you guys out for specific strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for very specific CBD
strains, I can recommend Tora Bora,
[SPEAKER_00]: ACDC, and Pennywise.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are looking for CBD
dominant strains right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I like to talk about is the
Night Nurse and I also like King's Cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are King's Cures available in seed
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Nurse is sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to find King's Cure in a
few places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab those if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some great CBD phenotypes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention, if people are
thinking about starting to use medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, first of all, start very
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to smoke, I suggest
starting off with flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off with a pipe with some flowers in
it or a joint and take one or two medium
[SPEAKER_00]: size puffs or draws or inhalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull it in until you feel like your
lungs are swelling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get enough smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to feel it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever died from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really scared that you're going
to have a shitty high and you're worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, make yourself a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have some food ready is what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanut butter and jelly sandwich is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got that, but you might not be
able to eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have something ready that you can just
snack on and be in a cool environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes wrong, eat your food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where I'm headed with this is if
you're new to medical marijuana and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about trying medical marijuana,
this is something I think you should think
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a very smart plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has been here for a long time and
I'm sure that it was given to us for a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal purpose, which lets me think
that if you have some pain or an ailment
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're trying to medicate through
cannabis, cannabis will target that
[SPEAKER_00]: ailment before it will cause intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you've got a broken part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say my knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: My left knee swells up by the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't do something about it,
my left knee hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I work hard, if I'm squatting up and
down carrying shit, my left knee will
[SPEAKER_00]: start to throb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll hurt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a few dabs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: First two dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get high from it, but I can feel
my knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first dab, the constant pain,
the like the, oh, that goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: One dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can relax, but I'm still at the
point where if I put pressure on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to lift up something and walk up some
stairs, it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dab number two removes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm at level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pain-free at sit still and I'm
pain-free at work mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pain-free now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next dab kind of makes me feel high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm getting to recreational dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My third dab, now I'm just high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or my fourth dab, sorry, now I can't even
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourth dab, now I'm just high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get fucked up having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that cannabis and cannabis
and abinoids know how to go target that
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and deal with that pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are legitimately, and I feel the
same thing works with opiates or other
[SPEAKER_00]: pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break your knee and you go to the
doctor and they give you Vicodin,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably gonna give you something
better than Vicodin, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: about pharmaceuticals because I don't fuck
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break your knee and you go to the
doctor, they're gonna give you pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have something broken, you're not
gonna get high as fuck off those pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the recommended dosage,
it's gonna go to your knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not broken and you take those
pills, you're probably gonna get high and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like shit from them because you don't
have any pain to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis knows that is what
I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're afraid of cannabis,
that is my encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is very smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is very gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis wants to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have consumed a lot of things in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things were not my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things made me feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things made me see the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has always been my friend in
every situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was sick, if I was well, if I was
bummed out, if I was happy, cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about trying
cannabis or if you've got somebody in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life that you want to encourage to use
cannabis, give them a pep talk that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis knows where to go hit the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got pain and you got a
problem, you're not gonna get too fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up right away because cannabis wants to
solve that problem first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
somebody asked for longer episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to go a full hour by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm just rambling out here.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna cue Action to bring you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, my man, alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take two!
[SPEAKER_01]: Go crazy, smoke till your vision is hazy.
Beats in your ears, burgundy eye.
Drinking cotton out, quenching cold 45.
If you don't know how to smoke,
get ready to learn.
Cause Afro's taking his turn to burn.
Take a eight, a quarter, a ounce.
Money up front so I can bounce.
Take a pound, take it out of town.
Catch in my hand, it's Afro.
Man, I got the beat, got to switch to
sweet.
Without me smoking, it's incomplete.
Like this, yo, like that, yo.
Like my women, I like my blunts,
fat hoes.
Smoke this, smoke that, my blunts are fat.
Afro man, got weed like that.
Everybody in the street smoking on my
sack.
Having THC, asthma attack.
Buy an ounce, yo, buy a pound.
While you listen to the rhythm of the
reefer sound.
Slinging zip for zip, like a crazy dream.
In the American dream, inhaling vaporous
steam.
Smoke on it, smoke on it.
Smoke and smoke and choke on it.
Weed turn to blunt, blood turn to roach.
And you hit it till nobody want it.
Smoke on it, smoke on it.
Smoke and smoke and choke on it.
Weed turn to blunt, blood turn to roach.
And you hit it till nobody want it.
Because smoking weed is what I do best.
Yes, yes, princess, I'm from the west.
If you don't think Afro man's for real,
let me tell you what happened to the man
of steel.
Superman came to town to see what he could
sell.
He stacked his mail high as hell until he
re-palmed it.
His pounds were stacked three stories
high.
His bong was made of steel.
I said, Afro man, run this land.
He said, boy, be for real.
He sound faster than the sheriff
department if they was smoking crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exhale my super prep and give the whole
world contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could fly my pounds around the world
without catching no heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I socialized with x-ray eyes and a grape,
swishy sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: He opened up his Ziploc bag and the vapors
began to smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the potheads started sniffing,
wandering through the dell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just when he had sold a pound and
thought his weed was right, I invented a
sack and took the town back with Palmdale
Crip tonight.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Superman said, yes, indeed, this is that
Palmdale tongue for weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, now that you know the deal,
bring all your dollar bills to my coup de
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Afro man from East Palmdale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that Crip tonight for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it right because I can't do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the whole world want to hit my
butt.
Smoke on it.
Smoke on it.
Smoke and smoke and choke on it.
Weed turn to blunt.
Blunt turn to roach.
And you hit it till nobody want it.
Smoke on it.
Smoke on it.
Smoke and smoke and choke on it.
Weed turn to blunt.
Blunt turn to roach.
And you hit it till nobody want it.
Smoke on it.
Smoke on it.
Smoke and smoke and choke on it.
Weed turn to blunt.
Blunt turn to roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hit it till nobody want it.
Smoke on it.
Smoke on it.
Smoke and smoke and choke on it.
