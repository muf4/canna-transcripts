[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 351 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No long fancy intro today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get right into this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of Whammy Bar
Nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combo of lemon essence and
papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as honeysuckle,
lemon candy and lemon candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this one on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the dab I just took tasted a lot
like kiwi strawberry snapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move this podcast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a lot to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been talking about doing a series
of episodes that run my listeners from the
[SPEAKER_00]: very beginning of a grow all the way to
the very end of a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about selecting your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about sprouting seeds and
cutting clones all the way through the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, all the way to flower, all the way
up to harvest and then we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a long series of detailed
episodes and this will be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: episode in that series.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
planning your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about setting goals for your
garden and I will also give you a few tips
[SPEAKER_00]: on how to stay out of trouble and avoid
common mistakes people make when setting
[SPEAKER_00]: up a new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've got a solid intro laid
down, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of dabs while
you grab a notebook and when we get back,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about planning your
cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you grabbed a pen and some paper
because there will be a lot of information
[SPEAKER_00]: in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into planning your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we start shopping for lights and
seeds and planning, for your first
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, there are a few things you can do
to make your growing experience more
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first piece of advice I have for
anybody who is planning to start a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is to buy grow books from reputable
grow authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Authors I can recommend are Ed Rosenthal,
Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert
[SPEAKER_00]: Connell Clark and Drew West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the second piece of advice is to open
those books and read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you read the whole book before
you start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you know what to expect before
problems arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if a problem does pop up,
you know what you've got because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it in the book, you know how to
diagnose it, you know how to treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't make the problem worse
by diagnosing a problem under pressure and
[SPEAKER_00]: making the wrong decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get yourself a grow book from a
reputable grower and read that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I like Ed Rosenthal,
Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert
[SPEAKER_00]: Connell Clark, Drew West.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a ton of great cannabis authors
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading books will give you an idea of
what to expect and you'll have an eye for
[SPEAKER_00]: things when they pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have as many surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find books from most of the
authors I listed on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find a lot of great free PDF
files if you do a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to increase your
cannabis knowledge is by listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, I recommend shows
like The Dude Grows and Free Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an advanced grower, I recommend
shows like Cannabis Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences and Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to learn about cannabis
is through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great cannabis YouTube
channels out there, but you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch cannabis specific videos to learn
about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch basic plant biology and
basic horticulture videos and most of that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to apply to your cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn about the plants, learn about the
way that they function and learn why they
[SPEAKER_00]: do what they do through those YouTube
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would avoid is cannabis
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of crap in cannabis forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why I started this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw people giving terrible advice on
cannabis forums and I wanted to come on
[SPEAKER_00]: here and correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be really careful if you're taking
advice from cannabis forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you avoid them
completely and stick with books,
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts, and YouTube channels from
reputable growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first piece of advice is to buy and
read grow books from reputable growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: then supplement that education with
knowledge from YouTube and podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we go too much further with
our plans to grow, we've got some things
[SPEAKER_00]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important thing to think about is
legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it legal to grow where you're planning
to set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is illegal, I can't recommend you
grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to tell you to obey the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to grow in an illegal
area, keep in mind that you are now
[SPEAKER_00]: committing a crime that could result in a
life-changing experience for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: your family, and everyone in that
household.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are suspected of running an illegal
grow in your home, the police,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly the SWAT team, possibly the DEA,
will kick in your door and drag you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your family into your front lawn in your
underwear while they destroy your entire
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take all of your money They'll
take your firearms if you have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will probably shoot your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may shoot you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your family is home, they will be
detained and possibly shot if they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: react properly to police instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your house is now a drug house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in ready for war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your wife and kids will never forget the
morning the door came off and armed men
[SPEAKER_00]: came in and took you to jail and destroyed
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your life will never be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this before you choose to set
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is dramatic and it will be traumatic
for you and everyone involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this before you hang up your
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this before you order your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep in mind that you are producing
a high-value product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking now about what you're going
to do if somebody tries to come in your
[SPEAKER_00]: home and take that from you while you were
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you know what you're getting into
before the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've made that important
disclaimer, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about why you are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing to supply yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing to supply a sick family
member?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to be the next neighborhood
hookup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to be the next Pablo
Escobar of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the real reason for your grow
and have a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your goal is to supply yourself,
think about how much product you need and
[SPEAKER_00]: every 60 to 90 days and set up a grow that
will supply that for yourself plus maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little extra in case you have an issue or
a delay in your next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing enough product to supply yourself
should be an easy goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing enough to supply the whole
neighborhood is when it starts to get
[SPEAKER_00]: risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you hang up another light,
you increase your chances of trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the risks involved before
you expand and I always recommend starting
[SPEAKER_00]: small, learning how to grow and then
expand from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about what you realistically
expect from your grow and set a goal for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow is going to be limited by the
amount of space you have, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment you have and also the amount of
electricity you can provide to that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your goals is to figure out how to
maximize the yield from the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: space you have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reasonable goal is one pound per
thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a thousand watt light usually is good
for about a four by four to a five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would expect about one pound per
every four by four or five by five foot
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't expect that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn your nutrients and
you've got to dial in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to give you guys an estimate and help
you design and set up your room and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to reach your goals,
you can reasonably expect one pound per
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt light once you get good at
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you really get good at growing,
you should increase that goal to closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: two pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you move into the double ended bulb
technology, you can certainly increase
[SPEAKER_00]: your expectations much more with more
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, all of what I'm talking about
is with high pressure sodium lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have enough experience with LEDs
to give you any estimates or expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is all just rough
expectations, rough estimates,
[SPEAKER_00]: about a pound per thousand watt light is
your general goal once you learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't focus too much on yields when you're
getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus more on learning the needs of the
plant, understanding the cycles of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and learning how to see what the
plants are telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus more on that when you get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the yields will come, the quality
will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you develop a relationship with the
plant, everything will fall into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you a rough idea of what
you can expect once you get dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back on track with things we
need to think about when planning our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I've got written down is
safety and security.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in detail
in the next episode, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting and planning your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be overall planning your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode will focus more in on
your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for safety and security, we're going to
go quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to worry about the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already talked in depth about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to worry about thieves and
criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already talked a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So safety and security will be discussed
more in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I've got is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is water accessible and affordable where
you plan to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you have an excuse for the extra
water consumption?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing on the list is electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're planning your grow,
keep in mind that you will be very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: by the amount of electricity you can pull
from a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most homes have a one or 200 amp service
depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got a hundred amp service,
you will be very limited on how many
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you can run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 200 amps of service,
you'll still be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, when they put the
electricity in your house, they did not
[SPEAKER_00]: consider you adding thousand watt grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put just enough for you to run all of
the appliances and things in your house
[SPEAKER_00]: and also plug in the blow dryer and the
microwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give you a lot of extra
amperage because they never thought you
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to plug in these high powered
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be limited by the
amount of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go out and buy four thousand
watt lights, maybe buy two and plug them
[SPEAKER_00]: both in and see if you start flipping
breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you won't be able to plug in two
one thousand watt lights into the same
[SPEAKER_00]: receptacle in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little plug-in right there,
it's got the plug-in on top, the plug-in
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your phone plugged into one,
you got the computer plugged into the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot plug in two one thousand watt
lights into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run out to the garage or
wherever you're going to flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make it come on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start heating up the
receptacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to blow the receptacle or it's
going to catch the wires on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to plug in two thousand watt
lights into the same plug-in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even be able to run two one
thousand watt lights in the same room if
[SPEAKER_00]: both of the plug-ins are on the same
breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the breakers in your house are
going to be 10 amps, maybe 20 amps,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe 35 amps if you're really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older homes, you're going to have 10s and
20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: More modern homes, you may have up to 35
amp breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our thousand watt grow lights pull
about 8 to 11 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they fire up, they want to pull 11
amps to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they're running, they'll drop down to
around 7 or 8 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to keep that in mind when
you're designing and thinking about your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much amperage is available in the
space in which you plan to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't expect to run a bunch of
extension cords because they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to catch on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start flipping breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just realize that you either need to
upgrade the electrical or you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: settle for less lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind that for every light you
hang, you probably need a blower or a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: or some sort of electricities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow extra amperage for your
accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've also got to run the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to turn on lights in the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what if somebody tries to run the
microwave and it blows up the whole grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that sort of stuff in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn down the house with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk more about electricity in
the Selecting Your Space episode as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk in depth about airflow in the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, people don't consider how much
trash they will create when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: building and running a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have boxes that say high
pressure sodium grow light on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to think about how to
get rid of that discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have empty nutrient bottles that
you need to figure out how to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we harvest, we've got to figure
out how to get rid of that old root ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the sticks and all of that dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to start thinking
about before we start buying grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and buying our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is the odor
and aroma of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to snitch on yourself by
having a stinky garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a good job, your plants are
going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need some sort of carbon
filtration to prevent the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood from smelling your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something a lot of people don't think
about is when you start cutting down your
[SPEAKER_00]: first grow, it really stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start chopping into those plants,
you start breaking open the turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when it really stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you thought it smelled good around week
six, seven, and eight, wait till you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them down and you start chopping into
them, that's when it's really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for that harvest stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, at harvest time, you've got to think
about that trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to think about all that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got a lot of herb to learn
how to dry and cure and store.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to dry it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to cure it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have space for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to store it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have space for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things to start thinking
about before you hang up any lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is a huge thing to think about
when you're planting your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of nutrients are you going to
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go organic or are you
going to go synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go a living soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do no-till?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of decisions to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has its advantage and
everything has its disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through this long series of episodes,
I will try to go over the pros and cons of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and synthetic, of hydro and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to talk about all of that stuff
and help you make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now is the time to start thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with that decision comes pest
control, integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to apply spray applications of
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to use predator bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these options have their pros and
cons and they're all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to find a pest management
system that also works with your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a full organic system,
you don't want to go in there and apply a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic pesticide that could disrupt the
environment you've spent so much time
[SPEAKER_00]: creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of your major things to think about
will be your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run soil, soilless mix,
cocoa, perlite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run rock wool cubes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with that decision, you get to
decide what you're going to feed those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go all organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go full synthetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do a combo?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another major part of that decision
is how you are going to prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will all work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your medium, your nutrients, and your
integrated pest management will all become
[SPEAKER_00]: one big unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that in depth before you
make any decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as this series continues,
I will do a lot of discussions on most of
[SPEAKER_00]: those topics and try to guide you and I
will try to remain unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about how I grow and I will
also try to give you unbiased information
[SPEAKER_00]: on other options and other methods that
will work just as well as the way I have
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's part of the beauty of
setting up your own grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no right or wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wrong way is when your plants die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right way is when you are happy and
you're getting what you want out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's producing the quality,
the amount, and you're satisfied,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably improve a little bit,
but you're doing it right and nobody can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you you're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with it, it's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you're doing it wrong when
the plants die or when you get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, but it's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make yourself happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you put a lot of thought into
your medium, your nutrients, your pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control, and if you want to go organic or
synthetic, a few more things you should
[SPEAKER_00]: think about are, do you want to grow from
seed or from clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do in-depth episodes in the very
near future on the advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of starting from seed or
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will also talk about how to
sprout seeds and we'll also do episodes on
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will go in-depth on that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But start thinking about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to grow from seed or do you
want to grow from clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a bunch of great things to
think about before you even buy a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy a grow book and read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find more podcasts that you find
educational and entertaining and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: those podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe find some YouTube channels that
teach you about basic plant sciences and
[SPEAKER_00]: watch those in your free time and get a
good understanding of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a lot of other things to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalities, safety and security,
water, electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good excuse for how much
electricity you're about to start
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the aroma you're going to
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to make that big debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, medium, organic versus
synthetic, and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to think about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to think about seeds or
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of stuff to have on your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is to think about where to
put all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to put the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What room is this going to go in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already see the wheels turning in
your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we will go in-depth
about where to put your grow, planning
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more in-depth about choosing
the correct lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more in-depth about airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk more in-depth about all of
the specific needs you need to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: when planning your specific grow space in
the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I also told you I would give you tips
on how to stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one tip to stay out of trouble
when working in a grow is to keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a legal area, if you're in
an illegal area, keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does anybody need to know you're
growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does anybody need to know you've got a
high value product somewhere in your home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does anybody need to know you've got
an extra stream of income?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think, what about my best
friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to turn your best
friend into somebody you can't trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about your girlfriend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, she might not be your girlfriend
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you want to worry about that shit
when you guys break up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your family is shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bro is shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your girlfriend is shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody changes when there is a high
value product sitting on the table and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody's looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to keep yourself out of
trouble is to not tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another piece of advice is to not stink
like herb all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go places, take a shower,
change your clothes, put on some non-herb
[SPEAKER_00]: stinking clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't always have a bunch of herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start selling herb and making a
bunch of extra money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start smoking excessively in front
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give anybody any obvious signs that
you have got access to an excessive amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't raise any eyebrows and don't draw
any extra attention to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my quick advice on how to stay
out of trouble when you are starting a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't suddenly have too much money and too
much herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay low key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay the person you were before you
started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stop paying for herb and start
growing your own.
