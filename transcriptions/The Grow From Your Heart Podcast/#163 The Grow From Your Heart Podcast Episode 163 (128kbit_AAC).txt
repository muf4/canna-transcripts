[SPEAKER_03]: Let me clear my throat for episode 163 of
the Grow From Your Heart Podcast,
[SPEAKER_03]: your source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're a news smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_03]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_03]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, my friends call me Ross the
Jeff, and I thank you guys again for
[SPEAKER_03]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for dealing
with the clogged up throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Jesse's fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame it on Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse showed up with good hash and liquid
turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, Jesse Grosz is back.

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow him there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, he's got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell everyone how they can find your

[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado Dope Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got Despicable D on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got 44 on there, and sometimes
there's a dude named Fetus that hangs out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else has been on the show?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tater.
[SPEAKER_03]: What up, Tater?
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually mentioned Tater yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't heard from that dude in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he in Colorado again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's up, Tater?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to get together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I owe you a high five and a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to hang out, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Tater if you listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two episodes in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to mention, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jesse's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, something I got to mention,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a whole bunch of fucking
messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said the wrong episode number at the
start of the last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not have any notes in front of me
with the episode number written on it like
[SPEAKER_03]: I normally do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote it down this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got it right, although I did
have to clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the best we could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please stop with the tweets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I said the wrong fucking number.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for trying to keep me on the right
path.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we hit record here, Jesse and we
like to hang out before the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get nice and medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get into a talking little zone here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse's kind of been on a cleanse,
hasn't been taking a lot of dabs,
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't been consuming a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he took the first dab,
I watched him get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of neat to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big dude and I just watched him
kind of melt a little bit after the first
[SPEAKER_03]: dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: He brought over some Liquid SFV,
some San Fernando Valley OG Kush Terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some Durban Poison Wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dunked a dab of, what am I smoking,
some Jack Flash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I dunked a dab of Jack Flash into
the Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be my word.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be the only one that says
terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Webster's new word of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Webster's schwag-tionary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were talking before the show,
as I was mentioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were getting nice and roasted and
medicated, taking dabs off the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jesse was telling me that he went to
Oregon and he was actually ballsy enough
[SPEAKER_03]: to take his medicine on the plane with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tell everybody what you traveled on
a plane with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some live res.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to sound ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took live res, water hash, rosin,
some flour, a little bit of clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: some terps, and a couple of the doctor's
orders vape paint cartridges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have a rig with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And two rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much everything but a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew not to take a torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you cannot take the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll take the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very similar to a bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already a bomb, essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't want that on the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rigs were in a locked case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put the rigs in my check-in baggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the product, though, I kept it in my
carry-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was backsealed and then in a Ziploc
baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took my med card and a copy of my
driver's license and put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the first thing they would see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They totally went through my bag and it
went through the x-ray scanner and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I flew there and back with it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and nobody gave you any harassment
at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to enjoy your medical marijuana
while you were in the great state of
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I flew out of a different airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like you had a great vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your favorite part?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting to see my best friend from high
school and lifelong buddy get married to a
[SPEAKER_00]: woman he is absolutely crazy about was
very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Oregon coast is just absolutely
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I highly recommend checking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the new married couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they listen to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to them either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The energy is out in the air now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm glad you're back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to get you on for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been a busy dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a new job there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about how many plants you
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will was on yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will was running, I think he said,
640 plants is what I think he said on his
[SPEAKER_03]: own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're talking and you're running.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got beds of 500 plants,
sections of 500 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody's been killing it with the
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a basically I've had I've ran
little med shop grows and now I'm in a
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a lot of fucking work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying earlier that it took you
all day to cut three to 400 clones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People there are people that would
probably they probably heard that they
[SPEAKER_03]: went shit, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could probably cut a thousand clones
today of grade A, you know, perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfectly chosen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said that you don't keep mother
plants, that you take the clones off the
[SPEAKER_03]: veg plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to run through the veg area
with a cup or a container of water and get
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts, gather them up and then go back to
the cloning area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consult back with the with the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to look at the schedule of stuff
that's already been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to look at the stuff that is
going to be before it so that we have we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a specific program to harvest four
strains a week out of our 16 strains so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we always have X strain on hand and
to keep in track with all that also is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot of work, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's things that people don't think about
is trying to keep the variety coming
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently because in a grow,
you're going to want to put let's do this
[SPEAKER_03]: whole row of sour diesel per se just
because you want that whole row.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when it comes time to put it on
the shelf now, you've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody comes to the dispensary to
buy product, we're going to shoot ton of
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel if that's all you're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see, we're a wholesaler,
so that makes it even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dispensary buyer comes to us and we
got a whole bunch of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's bomb, they're probably just
going to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the big reasons we have
to have a everybody like the variety that
[SPEAKER_03]: 31 flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what keeps them coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could probably if you could probably
sell 10 pounds of that sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you had five other strains,
you could probably sell seven pounds of
[SPEAKER_03]: each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them just because of the variety.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So variety is king.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't think about what it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking a little bit about it on
the show about commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't think about what it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to hear you come in and talk
about just scheduling the clones because
[SPEAKER_03]: it starts at the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to schedule the clones to know
what your variety is going to be in about
[SPEAKER_03]: one hundred and twenty days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's more like 90 for for my
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, still it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's planning preparation and then
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I got sidetracked
on when I was talking with Will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you do has to be documented in
metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much if your scissors touch a
plant, you have to open up a computer and
[SPEAKER_03]: make a note somewhere in the damn computer
that something happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one person spends 40 hours a week
doing nothing but that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's yeah, it's this MacBook on
a cart, which was actually a trash can
[SPEAKER_03]: with a piece of wood on top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a trash can on wheels that I pushed
around to walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water, one of the smaller areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like for water and small plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a board on top of that and put the
MacBook on top of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was my metric station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll that around and just do my metric
right there all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just made 900 clones of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just harvested this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cut off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are varying different different
compliance officers will tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: different rules on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cut off something on a plant,
it needs to be weighed and documented in
[SPEAKER_03]: metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go to that plant tag number.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to say, I made manicured point
four grams off of plant number nine zero
[SPEAKER_03]: five five five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to show on camera that
you destroyed the part that was manicured
[SPEAKER_03]: off the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very tedious and metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very tedious.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about Debs on a plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse got away with taking a show on a
plane and he looks like an ogre,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't even mess with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we talked about your new grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about what we brought you here
for the main topic that you when we talked
[SPEAKER_03]: on Facebook, you're like, I want to talk
about reminding people to clean up their
[SPEAKER_03]: grow space after the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you want to tell us about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a super good topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends on how you grow,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of homestead style is a term.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a term I've been using lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked it up from a person in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should give that person a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you mention the podcast to them at
all?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't even have Internet,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippie Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: She lived on the coast, down the road from
the place I was staying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's normally not like me to go out
and just randomly start talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: strangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, I there were some
huge tomato plants in her yard that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of attracted me to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up making a friend out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the true farmer in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tomato plants are done in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been harvested and eaten by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she had tomatoes up there in her yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess he was like, oh, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, that's I told her how she
grows or how I grew because she actually
[SPEAKER_00]: had a couple plants out back, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I told her how I grew and she called
me a homestead farmer or homestead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like that term.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my situation, I've got living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole bunch of plant waste,
the leaves, the stocks, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've taken all of that and ran it
through a chipper into the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by next summer, that will be nice black
compost and it'll have all the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that were still in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the this will be the third
year we've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just all goes right back into the
system again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mulched up my soil real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watered it down real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got it covered with plastic to
store it over the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that going to make a nice mycelium
layer happen in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get some funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a good thing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start seeing a lot of people see
that white fuzz, they'll make some super
[SPEAKER_03]: soil or they'll make some compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they see that white fuzz and they
freak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're working for.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That white fuzz is magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to make all the shit
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see your compost pile covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got all that handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plastic is good for several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps insulate the soil on really cold
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on really cold days, it's it's
going to get cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on days when it warms up and then it
cools off again, it can the warmer the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil stays, the more breakdown happens,
the more healthy it stays alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it protects it from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It protects it from getting blown away,
drying out and blowing all the precious
[SPEAKER_00]: topsoil off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also something I've noticed last
year is it keeps the damn neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: cats from neighborhood cats love to piss
and do their thing in your in your nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh garden soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps them away, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cats probably helps keep the birds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possibly birds wouldn't be so bad,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chicken shit into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that goes into the complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, OK, so it just all returns back to
the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use a Bokashi bucket at home?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pour that Bokashi bucket right into
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have another use for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I put it in a compost pile or
I'll just bury it directly in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here lately, I'm going to go ahead and
compost it inside after it's done in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put it in a little miniature tumbler
I made and that'll be to redo or make it
[SPEAKER_00]: less acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then I'm going to feed it to my
new worm inside worm bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and Spencer both doing worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barefoot's doing worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's going worm life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see everybody doing worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you tried to use the stuff from your
Bokashi bucket, the drainage that they
[SPEAKER_03]: call it, the leachate, that stinky foot
smell and juice that comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a clogged drain, pour that
shit right down the drain like probably
[SPEAKER_03]: two ounces down a clogged drain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll dissolve if you got like a hair
clog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got these dreadlocks down to my
fucking knees, so I get some hair clogs in
[SPEAKER_03]: the drain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shower, just pour that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll clean it right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll stink.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to pour it in there, let it soak
all through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it like an hour and then just go
run the hot water, kind of push it down
[SPEAKER_03]: and get rid of the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it eats it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you told me you cleaned a clone
machine with it once too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put that in the corner and let it
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It eats up all the basically dissolves all
the funky layer that the cloner gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets covered in calcium and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys take good care of your cloners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a cloner since I didn't clean it out
good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got clogged up and fried itself,
so my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally sidetracked you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing on the Bokashi liquid,
that is basically... I've been told this
[SPEAKER_00]: from two people that really know their
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically EM1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like great white shark, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using EM1 all summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting it from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making it myself and I'm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last couple of weeks, I've just
been using Bokashi bucket juice when I
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would use the EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see no noticeable changes, good or bad.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the rotting trash can became
foot smell, that's such great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a bar dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has food too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That somebody threw up in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're composting all of your stocks,
all of your big leaves that aren't usable
[SPEAKER_03]: for any product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all going into the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chicken shit's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All your food waste that you've been
eating all the time goes into your Bokashi
[SPEAKER_03]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making fertilizer out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gets buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our soil covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the soil covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not necessarily no-till where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go ahead and actually re-amend now
and put all your amendments you would put
[SPEAKER_00]: in in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of that old root ball do I need
to get out of there before I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave all of it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You leave all of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just chop the stick and then dig
another hole later?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep the soil wet and active
throughout the winter and the early
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, there will be no root ball when
you come back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it dry out and you don't cover
it, the root ball will still very much be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it moist and the earth will eat it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Re-assimilate it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it back into food.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can re-amend now in the winter and
that stuff will hopefully re-colonize and
[SPEAKER_03]: keep producing itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you'll have even more potent soil by
the time it's time to grow outdoors.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, the only things I would add
in would just be kelp and alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are going to break down all
the way through to where there's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: none left for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ... I really stumbled all
over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plant, go ahead and do a
mycorrhizae inoculant and then add a
[SPEAKER_00]: little kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when you're planting them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add a little alfalfa to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be ready to roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk more about that in later
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely going to record a whole
bunch of outdoor episodes for next year so
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've got them prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were both so busy this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These big commercial grows keep us on our
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My summer next year is looking to be even
busier.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you already know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it's only a few months away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: After November, we'll know if it's going
to happen or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just waiting until then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a whole nother outfit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have property.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have licensing, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just waiting to pull the trigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you seem to get involved in
seems to take off and get a good launch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stumble into all these startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're a guy that can get shit
done and people need somebody like you
[SPEAKER_03]: that can get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow store doesn't hurt either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to grow and I know how to do
things, but I don't know as much on how to
[SPEAKER_03]: get shit done as you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a guy like you to fucking build the
walls and build the tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then once you get the tables built,
then I can come in and build the watering
[SPEAKER_03]: system and run the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're on the move and I'm on
the move.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we rerun it a few times and they
decided we need to remodel and rebuild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So call Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a few months off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go somewhere else and Jesse will
come rebuild and I'll come back and
[SPEAKER_03]: regrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just keep playing dance around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go build shit, I'll go grow at places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a man on the move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll get you growing outdoors this
summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My backyard fence is three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm talking like 3,500 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go get a sunburn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been albino for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we'll work in the shade of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow them tall enough to where I can be
shaded under them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, Jesse mentioned, he said,
we will wait till November to decide if
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an election coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may get a president that doesn't want
medical cannabis or recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might put a kibosh on some of our
plans, but more locally what Jesse is
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about, we have amendment 200 and
amendment 300 here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: If those pass, the marijuana industry in
Pueblo, Colorado will be forced to shut
[SPEAKER_03]: down in the year 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get a full year to keep going,
but after that it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: No new licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people, even though they have a
license, they've never grown before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a change of location for them
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the new proposal, they wouldn't be
able to let it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably going to be too late by the
time this episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you voted, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a huge shout out to Mike,
to White Mike, Nemo Punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything he's done, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been putting huge efforts in for the
No On 200 campaign, the No On 300
[SPEAKER_03]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did more groundwork than anybody else I
saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to everybody else that
participated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm giving Mike all the credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a bunch of you,
but Mike is a person that led it in my
[SPEAKER_03]: eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there are more of you, but Mike is
one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw him doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He owes a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can name a few more names, but I can't
name them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of people I know that
deserve a shout out, but I don't exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: know their names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they're on Mike's team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, spread the love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them know they're getting shout outs
from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for what you do, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get you on a podcast here
in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be on every damn show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to White Mike and the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you guys are having fun on the couch
this evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a warm fall Saturday evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 80 degrees in my house because
we expected winter to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I covered up my swamp cooler because it
was cold the other night.
[SPEAKER_03]: The air was coming in there and freezing
me when I was trying to watch Narcos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an excellent show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, I hate the way it ended.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, there will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do a Cali cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which isn't nearly as exciting,
but it'll still be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an attachment to that show.
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 episodes was not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love anything drug smuggling culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just eat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a few books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched every documentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude, the big Lebowski, will be at the
Chronic Con in Colorado here coming up
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go meet him and take your picture
with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke a J with the dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a J with the dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so let's get a little bit back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we finished up talking about
cleaning up the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got it kind of re-amended for next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We filled it with some kelp and some
alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when it comes time for season,
we're going to dig a little hole and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to put some mycorrhizas in there,
some more kelp, some more alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe some crab meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just worms themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worms themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys get the worms going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worms are so good for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the compost pile,
by all means use it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in your holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds so gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in the holes where you're
planting your plants so that all that
[SPEAKER_03]: compost, that rich compost can feed those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're growing in pots,
you can still utilize that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're using salt-based chemical
nutrients, you can still utilize that
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the trend that I'm seeing on
Instagram and social media and even the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're recycling soil and running no-till
and you're seeing them top dress and
[SPEAKER_03]: decorate their plants to keep a layer in
there to where they can keep the moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're putting stuff like alfalfa sprouts
and other sprouts on top of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm loving the way that it looks in a nice
indoor garden with this other growth on
[SPEAKER_03]: top of your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a little ecosphere on top of your
plant there.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you got a pot plant growing out of it
and that little shit that's growing out of
[SPEAKER_03]: it is dying and actually feeding your
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a neat little thing to learn and
see happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a miniature environment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that permaculture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that'd be no-till, which is a
permaculture value, but permaculture is
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to wrangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a way of looking at things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned something today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're still at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep ourselves on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's chipped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put some stuff where the old plants
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: What should we focus on other than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning up your trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grow has got a little bit,
whether it's beer bottles or old netting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Pepper bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zigzag wrappers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all that shit cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your cages put away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use those, if you're netting or
whatever, get that all put up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to reuse it next year,
you need to store it away and get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with your water barrels, your air
pumps, any kind of liquid nutrients you
[SPEAKER_00]: had outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get all that inside and in a
warm place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bring it inside to your grow area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bring the bugs and mildew into your
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it in the shed outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take some time and clean it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just polish it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had a fan or something outside,
take it apart, clean it, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it with some H2O2 or some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the same thing with the 30%
hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it with some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing will clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even like enzymes complete or hygrosime
or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some of the Bokashi juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use what's at your disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bronner's soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that with some pine oil or
something like that in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to kill anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Dr. Bronner's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wash my dreads with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can wash everything with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so clean up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out there and clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take all the equipment out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it look like there was never a grow
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow in pots and you want to reuse
all your soil, even if you're growing pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not reusing your soil,
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had any issues, they're still
lingering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to reuse it, get it all
in a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover it with plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same principle we were talking
about with covering the raised beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had some fungus gnats or powdery
mildew, is that going to be destroyed in
[SPEAKER_03]: the composting process or is that going to
compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats, if you get the pile heated
up enough, which means you've got to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: considerable amount of raw green material
and just organic matter for it to heat
[SPEAKER_00]: back up, it will most definitely kill the
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we might be killing ourselves trying
to do both because I think if you put the
[SPEAKER_03]: green in there, the PM will grow on the
green, but I don't think the PM can grow
[SPEAKER_03]: on things that are not leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, green matter could even be,
or like green manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be cow shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything that's going to heat
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass clippings, if you feel safe using
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old pot leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old pot leaves, yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicken poop is just such a great
amendment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's funny that I say that because
I'm a vegetarian and I don't even eat the
[SPEAKER_03]: chickens, but I've noticed that when
chicken poop goes into a compost,
[SPEAKER_03]: goes into plants, it really does
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then seabird poop also, any sort of
seabird poop, anything from the sea is
[SPEAKER_03]: really, really rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way sea stuff grows.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why that California kush smells so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea gannics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ever had to label the way I like to
grow, you know, that's sea gannics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to edit that out so nobody
steals that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that might be a phrase you want to
... No, because there may be someone on
[SPEAKER_00]: the coast that's like way more worthy of
using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some girl around the coast that wants to
make some sea-based ... But you better be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting like your own kelp and your own
bird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swim out to the ocean with some buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impress me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably illegal as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did not hear that here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, there's kelp laying all over the
beach in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably going to get in trouble if
you collect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure people wouldn't mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it, put it in some bottles and ship
the first test or batches to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse all the salt off first, please.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just see the plants just ... What
did you do to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I forgot to rinse the kelp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are way off topic, but we are still on
topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I deal with every year
and I fucking did it this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out your outdoor spray bottles
because like mine have teas go through it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a lot of molasses and they
always clog up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the spring, I'm just like
motherfucker and end up throwing it away
[SPEAKER_00]: and going and getting a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pump it and you go to spray it and it
goes ... I cleaned them all out with super
[SPEAKER_00]: hot water this year and good to go for
next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys buy the pump sprayers that have
the nozzle on it where you can release the
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the ... You want to be able to
release that pressure because otherwise
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll pump it up real hard and the
fucking ... The nozzle will get stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll never get it off of there and now
you can't refill it and you got to just
[SPEAKER_03]: throw it away because you'll try to pop it
open with something you're just going to
[SPEAKER_03]: break it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the plastic somewhere will spin or
trust me, get the type that have the
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure release valve so you can ... Once
it's pumped up and pressurized,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can take that pressure off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really scary trying to undo it when
you got neem oil in there and you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want it to spray up in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that happen with someone that had a
tank full of fluoromite once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a backpack tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pumping it and pumping it and they
didn't have the lid screwed on all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was back before we knew that
fluoromite was a no go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you got to do something,
if you get a brand new clone and it came
[SPEAKER_03]: from somebody and you really, really want
it but it might have something to hit it
[SPEAKER_03]: if you need to, but mother that out and
take clones from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go smoking the fluoromited one.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least try to get a generation from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we've cleaned up everything
we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to cover up the holes for the area
for next year or do you just want to leave
[SPEAKER_03]: it exposed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover that up so that all the stuff can
process in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some heat in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your compost pile going.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got everything cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even look like a grow happened
in that yard or that field anymore,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make it look nice and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all, it's a clean slate for you
to go back next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as soon as the snow melts and
you're thinking about growing,
[SPEAKER_03]: the next thing to do is go out there and
fix all of the holes in your fences and go
[SPEAKER_03]: check that fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go make sure that that thing is super
secure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go pick up all of the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure your dog or one of your buddy's
dogs have been out there dropping deuces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go pick that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want all the flies coming around
because of dog poop out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it gets warm, that's the stuff
you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how serious you get,
I actually, I know of a couple of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are already growing their plants for
next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a small 25, 35 plant or less
outdoor grow, you can get away with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start your plants in February
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from seed and you want
to do a phenose selection, I suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: starting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing from clones,
February, you can start them up if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going for trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start them up, get them huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get root bound ever,
ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they will start to flower on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will start flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So veg them inside, get them big,
top them, get them loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them get root bound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep them pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not run them on a 24 hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light unless you plan on putting them
outside underneath a 24 hour light.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I would have never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you got a hoop house and you
can run a little, all it takes is like
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do that, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience running them 24 and
then putting them outside under not 24 is
[SPEAKER_00]: it just, it either stunts them out,
sativas, it'll throw them into bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I mean, indicas, it'll throw them into
bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so just- And then you get two
weeks of going into bloom and then going
[SPEAKER_03]: back into veg and then vegging and then
going back into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got plants that just look
like hell and they're mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a very funky looking plant
this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your trimmers hate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else that we should
mention when it comes to cleaning up your
[SPEAKER_03]: garden at the end of the season to prepare
for the winter end of the next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing major.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have loc, on gates or something
like that, put them inside unless they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just keeps them from at least
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps them from getting arrested up and
crap like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a lot of the things I do is so
that I don't have to spend money on it the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that my tools last all summer,
you know, first several years,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just one season at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of that comes with age or
getting older for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting tired of buying the same
damn hammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did I put that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left it out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you get that shit and put it away,
especially around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you leave it somewhere,
it's fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get a chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be they'll almost take the shit
out of your hand if you blink long enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not mean to bash this town,
but fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs are real bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the town north of us has the other
drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the drug that makes you go real
slow and sleepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then up north, they got the ones that
are making you go real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just fucking ridiculous all over
the place lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's fucking flipping out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, Jesse's taking a big fat dab of
some Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Tascarock in the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cough it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, it sounds like it's my turn to
take a dab.

[SPEAKER_00]: They are so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't seem like they're mad at you
for wanting a sandwich at the sandwich
[SPEAKER_03]: place?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually glad to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in super small little podunk towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we had a great customer service
experience out there, I would think of
[SPEAKER_00]: your rants on Facebook about how horrible,
and I'm like, you know, he's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
