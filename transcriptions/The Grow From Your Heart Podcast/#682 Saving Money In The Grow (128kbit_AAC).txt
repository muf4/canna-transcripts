I do have a couple of fun things to ramble
[SPEAKER_00]: about before we get to the main topic of
this podcast I try not to brag about all
[SPEAKER_00]: the amazing shit that I get to do But
since the world has opened up and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: having fun again I want to share an
experience that I had a few nights ago on
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday Doug Benson headlined comedy works
in Denver, Colorado Of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the comedy works is my favorite
comedy Club on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the best club on the
planet the downtown club in Denver They've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a great staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got an amazing owner They've got
an amazing stage a great club and the acts
[SPEAKER_00]: that they bring are always top-notch Of
course, if you've been listening for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, you know that Doug Benson is my
homie That should be a bumper sticker Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: Benson is my homie somebody make it happen
But Doug Benson is my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hanging out for quite a while
I've seen a lot of Doug Benson shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority I think almost all of them were
at the comedy works downtown But Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: Benson came to Denver and he did a show at
comedy works and he did a great show Big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Clint usually goes to comedy
shows with me He's my comedy buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both comedy nerds Clint was busy
that day So I invited my buddy Baker who
[SPEAKER_00]: lives in Denver Denver is a Baker is a
former employee of the comedy works So
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody there knows Baker everybody
there knows me because I'm a regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there every week It was a really good
time walking in with Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Doug Benson came out on stage I
did chat with Doug a little bit before the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some tweeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some talking He chose not to smoke
with people this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know Doug, you know, he is a big
smoker He usually hangs out with the crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the quarantine conditions
because of kovat he's chosen to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: himself He wasn't smoking with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose to respect that so we didn't hang
out before the show like normal But when
[SPEAKER_00]: he walked on stage, he made sure to wave
to me He made me stand up and show the
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little bit interesting He
realized my buddy Baker was the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting next to me eventually and he's
like, oh, hey, dude didn't realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: was you That was kind of funny,
but at the end of the show, I tried not to
[SPEAKER_00]: impose on Doug Benson I knew he wanted
some privacy But I was invited to go say
[SPEAKER_00]: hello after I popped into the green room
said hello Then I quickly excused myself I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew Doug was trying to protect himself
and not try to get sick and not be around
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people So I threw a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw some high fives and I said hey,
it's crowded in the green room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of here There was a young man in
that green room who we're not gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: too political, but he's not into the mask
thing He finds it silly That's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I politely excused myself from the
green room shortly after that He came out
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke with me since everybody smoking
in the green room was kind of a mask
[SPEAKER_00]: person So the guy that followed me outside
and ended up smoking a big 14 gram joint
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cream with me was this comedian You
might have seen on TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was Josh blue That was a really
good experience Because I excused myself
[SPEAKER_00]: from that green room and tried not to
impose and mix myself up into that crowd I
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up smoking a big fat joint with Josh
Blue sometimes life just works itself out
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a blessing Josh blue,
of course was just on America's Got Talent
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the the comedian with cerebral palsy
not trying to be rude But if you ever pass
[SPEAKER_00]: a joint to a guy with cerebral palsy be
fucking patient trying to get that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: back Had to chase it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd sit in front of him He makes one of
his palsy arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking hilarious But really you had
to chase it down his palsy arm just went
[SPEAKER_00]: out of control and he had the joint in the
palsy arm I'm like when I'm never getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking joint back had to chase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a funny joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at Him right in the eye and shook
my head like you motherfucker you put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in that hand because he knew better He was
I I'm not sure if he was fucking with me
[SPEAKER_00]: or if his palsy arm was out of control And
that joint was just going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway big up to Josh blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great experience Something I
want to mention a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a podcast talking about seeing Doug
Benson I said that Doug Benson pulled out
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of papers called and I called it a
handful of grandpa If you see Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you're gonna laugh at the handful
of grandpa if he's still doing one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bits That I saw him do I'm not gonna blow
his act at all, but handful of grandpa
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go see Doug Benson and laugh when
that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that's enough bragging about
comedy I just wanted to share with you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys what I do sometimes it's fun to bring
you into my world Some people are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: say I'm bragging some people are gonna say
thanks for hanging out big up to both of
[SPEAKER_00]: you Thank you both for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright now let's focus more on cannabis
growing ganja production a Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption podcast I'm scrolling through
my notes trying to get myself on track
[SPEAKER_00]: here big shout out to Doug Benson big
shout out to comedy works big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker big shout out To Josh blue big shout
out to the opening acts big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who made Sunday an amazing day
Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a big topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cannabis growing Let's
talk about a few ways to save you money in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do offer professional commercial
cultivation Consulting services one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I talk about when I go to a
commercial cultivation to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultation Those are a lot of words
together But when I go to do that one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I focus on is increasing
productivity Or reducing costs by about
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% I know I can save some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can increase costs Can I do both
enough to increase productivity and reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: costs by 30%?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge goal in a commercial
facility if you can increase productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: by 30% That's 30% more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna make which will really help
out right now a lot of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities in Colorado We're barely
scraping even so we've got to make every
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar count This also counts when you're
working in your own home grow if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got one light If you've got four lights if
you've got a 12 lighter in your garage
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you're doing it every dollar
counts, especially in the situation we are
[SPEAKER_00]: in I don't know how the pandemic treated
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you made some money Maybe you went
broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're scraping by it doesn't matter
Everybody can save a few bucks if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: money and you save a few bucks You have
more money if you barely have any money
[SPEAKER_00]: and you save a few bucks Maybe you can use
those dollars to improve on something in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life or in your garden So let me get
my high ass on track and let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some ways to save money in your grow space
First of all in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I focus on is is you're
building the appropriate size Did you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: a big-ass warehouse thinking you're gonna
load it up with lights and plants and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're only using a small portion of that
Real estate is expensive space is
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive every square foot of your
cultivation space costs you money use it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not using it you are wasting
space that is a big void do you want to if
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you a cooler and I said put Weed in
the cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna put weed in some of the
space in that cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna fill the whole cooler with
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that with your grow environment fill
that bitch up or you are wasting space
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize your output Of course,
you do need processing area trimming area
[SPEAKER_00]: working area But you get the point if
you've got some dark area a room that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not even being used if you're storing shit
in there Just because it's empty utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: that room do something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it pay for itself real estate square
footage is Expensive and that matters in
[SPEAKER_00]: any growth If you're running a commercial
grow a five by five tent a three by three
[SPEAKER_00]: tent be economical be Cost-effective with
your space use every square foot of space
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got you paid for it Even if
it's a tent you bought a five by five tent
[SPEAKER_00]: use the five by five I see people setting
up a trellis in a five by five and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to grow three plants or four
plants in their legal location So they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: put four plants in there, but they don't
veg it out to fill that tent So even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're running a three by three fill it up
if you're running a five by five fill it
[SPEAKER_00]: up veg long enough to Utilize that space I
see a lot of wasted space in a lot of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tents and think of it this way Sometimes
it's illegal where people are growing Are
[SPEAKER_00]: you gonna grow just enough to get by or
are you gonna grow enough to fucking make
[SPEAKER_00]: it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you get in trouble You're
getting in trouble either way if you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and it's kind of this big or if you
got a plant It's this fucking big and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in your house It's gonna be the same
charge go big or go the fuck home and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it worth it fill your space So real estate
is one of the number one things that I see
[SPEAKER_00]: people wasting into In any grow fill your
tent fill your commercial grow then
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing that I see when those rooms
are filled They're only filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not filled with plants and the
lights are running Just like your mama
[SPEAKER_00]: says just like your dad says if that light
isn't on for a reason turn it the fuck off
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not in that room turn the light
off if there are not plants underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: that light turn the light off Why is that
light running for no plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got the whole room lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the workspace is bright It looks like
a big productivity area, but you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: burning lumens Wasting your bulb run an
electricity the kilowatts are just
[SPEAKER_00]: spinning on the meter outside You're not
getting anything from it except a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running lights that are unnecessary
You're creating more heat, which means you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to run more fans Which will also mean
you probably need more air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: which are all sucking more kilowatts that
you don't need So think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment you do not need that's running
right now and turn it off Maybe you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: plants too far apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like to plant I like the plants to
have some space They need some breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to be crowded But do you
have plants too far spread apart
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessarily to where you've got extra
lights on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you possibly turn off that row of
lights move all those plants over and wait
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to grow a little bit and then
when they're bigger Then we'll use more
[SPEAKER_00]: light that may be something that you're
not thinking about Something else to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about move the plants closer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easier to do if you are using
smaller pots Are you using the right size
[SPEAKER_00]: pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use graduated pot sizes,
which means I start off in a so you go
[SPEAKER_00]: from a cloner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your clone Your clone however many
those fucking cram those under a light as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as they go into the small pots You
can get them pretty close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are only three inches tall
three inches wide Why do they need a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of space cram a lot of those together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them under the light then as soon as
they start growing spread them out make
[SPEAKER_00]: them comfortable But don't give them two
or three lights until you need to run two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three lights This isn't as big of a
deal in a small grow But once you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial environment when I'm saying
one or three lights that means ten fifteen
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty lights that adds up Quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have unnecessary lighting that
is running are your plants in small enough
[SPEAKER_00]: pots where you can push them together and
Save some space until it is time to add
[SPEAKER_00]: though the bigger pots and the extra
lighting now something that will save you
[SPEAKER_00]: some more money if you're running smaller
pots as you obviously don't need as much
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or cocoa as Soon, you're gonna need
it later, but you don't need it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save some money now Money comes
and goes it you may not have all the money
[SPEAKER_00]: right now You may have it later to buy
more soil for bigger pots So you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller pots for now until you get that
next paycheck Maybe do whatever you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do to make the next few bucks Then you
put them in bigger pots, then you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread them apart further put them under
more light But then you need to water them
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put them in a smaller pot,
they don't need as much water They don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need as much nutrients also that takes
less time and we're gonna talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: here toward the end of the show So one
quick thing you can think about is pot
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I using too big of a pot too early?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I keep these plants in smaller pots
keep them closer together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep less light on and that may save
you some money that could save you a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of money Just the water the nutrients the
time the light then that equals more air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning and fans that you can turn
off That is one quick thing that can save
[SPEAKER_00]: you a few bucks consolidate the plants
under less lights No matter what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you're running.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do cost money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they are high efficient LED lights
They are costing you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generating heat They're making
more equipment run and the bigger pots if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using bigger pots unnecessarily it
takes more water takes more nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: takes more pH Up or pH down takes you
longer to mix takes you longer to water
[SPEAKER_00]: the water costs money It all adds up if
you really pay attention and think about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about some of your
ancillary gear How are your dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidifiers running?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they on too frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they on often enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they on?
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessarily Sometimes I recommend
putting them on to battle each other in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure environment I will set them
both at 55 and just let them fight so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it stays at 55 all day in that room But
that isn't a commercial environment Where
[SPEAKER_00]: it is critical that we keep those
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have gear running unnecessarily?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you can you turn some of it off now
that we've turned off some of the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that help you out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned the filters in those
devices because when those filters get
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty, they are not as efficient That is
also true with your air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned your air conditioning
filters?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're dirty, they're sucking up some
of your efficiency You're not getting as
[SPEAKER_00]: much airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motors are running.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wasting money You're not getting
the air and the cooling that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting But you are putting out the
electricity and the stress on your gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is costing you money So now that
we're talking about air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you running ducting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have vented lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a carbon filter that's blowing
air out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some sort of air coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ducting every time you put a bend in your
ducting it becomes less efficient every
[SPEAKER_00]: time you put a curve a kink a bend or a
twist in that ducting you are slowing down
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of air and the Speed of the air
the volume of air which can move through
[SPEAKER_00]: that duct you are lessening the Efficiency
efficacy efficiency of the fan the blower
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using to blow that air through
that ducting So if you straighten it out a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, you could probably use Save a
few kilowatts use a little less bucks use
[SPEAKER_00]: a little less power to move more air Of
course, I understand ducks need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we get the flexi duct shit does
happen, but maybe unnecessary curves and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit maybe unnecessary duct length Can be
minimized one thing you do have to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind though is if you're using the lights
with the ducted hoods You do need to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of keep the light from coming in if you've
got sunshine or another light or something
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need those bends I understand
but try to minimize and mitigate those
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive bends if you are using the
lights that have the glass between So
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bulb and glass and your canopy
that way the heat doesn't get down into
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow You duck that heat out clean
that glass that glass being dirty will
[SPEAKER_00]: suck up Your lumens if the light can't get
through it's not getting to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are wasting money You're paying for it
The lights are burning the lights are hot
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're just cock blocking it with your
pesticide They got sprayed up on that
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even making it to your plants
something else We can think about when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to ducting that I almost overlooked
is where are you running your ducting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting that heat if you're
running that hot air right outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the winter maybe consider dumping
that heat into the office into a bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere that you want to heat up anyway,
maybe then you Can turn off the heater and
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the house You can just dump
your grow room heat right into your
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom And then you don't even have to
run the heater that will save you a few
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks use the heat that's already being
created Sometimes I will dump the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: from my bedroom into my flower space when
the lights go off Because in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower room will get colder,
but the bedroom stays on so we just run
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat from there into the flower space
It keeps the flower space nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about where you're running your
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you pulling cold air from somewhere
and not sending it somewhere that it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really think about where you're moving
your air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're moving temperature air move it to
where you want it Maybe you can use it
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle that air warm up a room cool down
a room I don't know your environment your
[SPEAKER_00]: situation But there are a lot of options
that will come up where you can utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: the air the heat the cool that comes from
the grow space Now let's segue back into
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting space with unnecessary
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately and unfortunately I am limited
by the state of Colorado of how many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I can Have that kind of helps me
out because I could have hoarder
[SPEAKER_00]: tendencies if I were unlimited on plants I
would have a lot of mother plants being a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder somebody who likes to create new
genetics and have a large library of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics to create and also a large
library to smoke from I would have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants if I weren't limited So it's
kind of a good thing that the state does
[SPEAKER_00]: limit me every plant in my garden has a
purpose I've got mother plants I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: father plants and then of course,
I've got my plants that are in bloom that
[SPEAKER_00]: are seeded I've got my father plant and
they're dumping the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got very select plants that all
have a purpose Do you have plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not exactly sure your plan their
goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they sticking around?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just like that one because that
strain is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that strain worth the shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it produce is it a quality strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just keeping that plan around for
nostalgia because of the name because of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool story It's got to meet goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to meet a criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to meet a quota Does it give you
enough product when you grow it does it
[SPEAKER_00]: take too long to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super potent does it taste right if you're
a commercial grower does it sell because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're putting all of this money into
the grow It's got to come back,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it sell when it sells?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it get you top dollar or to your
clientele pass on it if they pass on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you growing that shit grow more of
the lemon Jeffrey because the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna buy that grow the machine grow the
sacca souffle That's what they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: buy if they're not buying it switch it up
So every plant in your grow space should
[SPEAKER_00]: have a solid purpose And a strategy and a
schedule not just uh, it should not just
[SPEAKER_00]: be a potent plant that pays the bills But
it should also have a schedule it got cut
[SPEAKER_00]: this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into veg this day It goes into
flower this day I plan to cut it down this
[SPEAKER_00]: day and then I intend to have it dried
cured and sold or smoked or processed or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever By this time frame have a
schedule for every single plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or that plant is kind of wasting
space and messing up your schedule and
[SPEAKER_00]: Messing up your income and your cost
effectiveness Now since we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about individual plants in the grow I did
mention mother plants are mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary for your style of grow Think
about this a mother plant is kept to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve the genetics so that when I want
Let's just pick a plant when I want golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat I can go to my go to my golden goat
plant pull off six clones now I've got six
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of golden goat whenever I want them
and that mommy plant is always chilling
[SPEAKER_00]: there She grows every six or eight months
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to cut her down take one of those
best clones and remodel Mom that clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: make a new one because the plant just gets
old and big and spindly and out of control
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to give it a fresh cut start over
but for the most part that golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: mommy is there as a bank as preservation
What is stopping me from just using that
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat veg plant and right before I
put it into flower Take a few clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: use those clones as my next veg run move
that plant right into the flower space If
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not a breeder if you are not
completely dependent on keeping those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains around that is a very viable
option That will free up numbers for you
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just take a plant that is your
lemon Jeffrey plant take six clones of it
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the big plant into the flower room and
you got six clones growing up for your
[SPEAKER_00]: next run They're already right there Maybe
wait until your clones root before you put
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant to flower so you have some
security but it is not completely
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary to keep a mother plant around if
You are skilled at taking clones if you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to keep veg plants healthy
and happy and if you can get the clones to
[SPEAKER_00]: root in a timely manner before you put the
Other plant into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping clones is not always necessary
and that could save you a lot of space I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't recommend that for a commercial
environment because you may need a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones You need some dedicated plants to
give you cuts from but in a home grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space that would save you a lot of plants
Now let's get back to talking about mom
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you have so many mom plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need them or why do you have so
many strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need that many?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just keeping them for hoarder
purposes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said most of this already but
really think about why you're keeping each
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then possibly minimize if you
don't need all of those if you've got two
[SPEAKER_00]: that are Depends on what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the goal But if you're a
commercial cropper find the one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: that sell the best that way You don't have
to keep clones or moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just keep production going If
you're a medical grower find the one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two the one for the day the one for the
night and then one to Switch it up because
[SPEAKER_00]: you always need that switch hitter I feel
like you get strain lock if you smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit the same shit too long, but Try to
pick two or three maybe four and minimize
[SPEAKER_00]: down and make sure that every strain in
that garden Has a solid reason for being
[SPEAKER_00]: there if you feel to grow with a bunch of
sixes How are you gonna get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: nines in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you got a bunch of nines and you
got them surrounded by sixes it just D
[SPEAKER_00]: values the nines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the nines in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some tens Maybe some 11s if you quit
fucking with the sixes Alright another
[SPEAKER_00]: great way to save a few bucks or increase
productivity in a small space is to add
[SPEAKER_00]: some shelves for vertical growing if
you've got clones on a shelf what's to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop you from putting like a three or four
tier shelf with the t5 light with the tray
[SPEAKER_00]: of clones with the t5 light with the tray
of clones with the t5 light and a tray of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or Just a one shelf area and you
could put small plants on the bottom big
[SPEAKER_00]: plants on the top Hang your light from the
underside So you got a light for the small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants then put your big light up on the
ceiling and put your plants up on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf Use that vertical space to the best
of your ability We have a friend that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been on the podcast before that does a
complete vertical grow So there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of options to go up if you run out of
space on the floor Use that vertical space
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can make space for all of your
gear and all of your stuff get that up off
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor Then you've got more floor space
for working more floor space for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I see a lot of walkways and grows
and a small grow and a personal grow What
[SPEAKER_00]: do you need a walkway for we talked about
this on a previous episode that is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: walking path That's not your Zen garden
That is not where you go to put your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: behind your back and walk around like old
men and feed the ducks think about life
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a productivity space put plants in
the fucking walkway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand A commercial grow you've got
to get through there If it's your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grow move plants into that space so you
can fit another row of plants put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: there You're ripping yourself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing drywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing floor We want to grow
more plants put more plants in that space
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my theory back to filling up the
cabinet or the box or the cooler Fill it
[SPEAKER_00]: up quit wasting space with the walkway You
could just do some work move the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and walk through do the Jenga move do the
Tetris move Do whatever you have to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: get through there, but let's not waste so
much space with walkways Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got a lot going on shelves
for vertical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many moms do you have cut and go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a strategy for every plant
when I cut a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I think I mentioned this briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I cut a clone I know where
it's going to go into I know which space
[SPEAKER_00]: it will go in the veg area I know which
space it's gonna go into the flower area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know basically what day it'll go into
the flower area Do you have a plan and a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy for every single plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some people that just cut a bunch of
Clones they pot all of them and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes time to go into flower They've
got 20 or 30 clones and they pick the best
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah that many plants extra running
for that long that you wasted water soil
[SPEAKER_00]: space newts time and energy Get rid of
that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant you cut should be top shelf
Give it the best love you can pay the best
[SPEAKER_00]: attention you can to it and that way you
don't have to cut a bunch of Extras and
[SPEAKER_00]: waste all the time and space have a goal
for every single plant that you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: everything costs something everything in
the Row costs something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with just cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to use Clone gel you had to use
clone plugs a clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to clean the equipment which took
you time and energy Then you had to use
[SPEAKER_00]: water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just for cutting clones We're
already at a substantial cost you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the store and drop some money
already Then you've got to pop those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones into something You've got to buy
either soil cocoa something to put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: then you got to have a container to put
that shit in then probably some plant tags
[SPEAKER_00]: or something then we got to Feed them we
got to give them water that is material
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to pay for and more time that we
are investing everything costs something
[SPEAKER_00]: Big pots cost something soil and cocoa
again cost something the pH up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: cost something The pH pen costs a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are expensive and they die
you break them quite often Everything
[SPEAKER_00]: costs some cost a lot If you've got a pH
pen, make sure you keep the cap on it Make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you keep it clean and calibrated
that'll save you some money because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to buy a new one Take good
care of your equipment the lights all cost
[SPEAKER_00]: money The water costs a lot of money,
but something you might not be thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about something you may not have
considered What is your time worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your energy in that grow worth if
you're a single person like myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a single dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 18 She wants to hang out sometimes
nowadays, but I'm a single dude so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicate a lot of time to my garden But if
you've got a family if you got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit going on people want your attention
your girlfriend's trying to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: movie your kids need attention your dog
wants to play the other part of life your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends on the Xbox live or PlayStation
Live want to hang out and blow up zombies
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got other shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your time is very valuable What is it
worth to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time are you spending in there
when it comes to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Recooping the cost of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you considering your time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting paid for the hours that
you're spending in there and then think
[SPEAKER_00]: about maybe you'll do shit more quickly if
you're thinking like oh I'm in here this
[SPEAKER_00]: much a day because time is money no matter
what you're doing No matter where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately now time is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be doing something else Making
some money doing another task fulfilling a
[SPEAKER_00]: side job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get this stuff done and think
about how many hours we're spending in
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about a couple of other
things that I think can definitely help us
[SPEAKER_00]: out if we use strategy when purchasing
What is your pesticide regimen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your integrated pest management
plan strategy goal schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to buy pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to buy predator bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about this before we get too
far into any grow because this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a cost Quality pesticides are not
cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't use something bugs will
get to your garden and that is even more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive Preventative measures are more
affordable and more effective than trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to fix a problem because then you're gonna
have to go nuclear You're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: find specific shit based on what stage
you're in I think if you plan ahead start
[SPEAKER_00]: having a pesticide regimen early it is
more cost-effective Are you gonna use
[SPEAKER_00]: spray pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna use bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about it now because if we
plan for this ahead fit it in the box
[SPEAKER_00]: budget when we build the grow that'll help
us out then let's not use too much
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide I see a lot of people and they
mix it up They go mix up a five or I work
[SPEAKER_00]: in a commercial grow So it's a five gallon
thing a fucking or a one gallon thing of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides most of the time And then I see
them dump some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's remember and learn how much we're
gonna use per spray Let's try to
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always have to mix up the whole
entire fucking sprayer worth You can just
[SPEAKER_00]: mix up enough to cover the plants So this
time maybe just do as a water spray put
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking half a gallon away Water in your
sprayer and see if that covers the room
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does you only need a half a
gallon of pesticide if it doesn't maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a full gallon Give it a dry or
just a wet run is gonna say a dry run But
[SPEAKER_00]: you know give it a wet run and see how
much you need to wet the room Then go back
[SPEAKER_00]: the next time and hit it with the
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste the pesticide Then think
about how much time you're spending
[SPEAKER_00]: applying those pesticides I always talk
about it the cost versus releasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: predators versus applying the pesticide
Which is more cost-effective because you
[SPEAKER_00]: do need the personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a suit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reentry Interval with the
pesticides sometimes the predators are
[SPEAKER_00]: more cost-effective, but you do need to
have a crew to go put them out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants So think of which one is gonna be
more cost-effective for you Then when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to applying the pesticides when it
comes to just about anything in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: get the appropriate Equipment if you get
some cheap sprayers some cheap shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna break after the second or third
Maybe sometimes the first use They always
[SPEAKER_00]: say the most expensive hammer is the cheap
hammer because you're gonna break it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to buy a hammer every fucking week
every month Get a good hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only got to buy it once then they say
pay once cry once some shit like that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't remember all the funny shit that old
people say but buy quality shit You're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have a better experience with good
equipment If your grow room equipment is
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating to use you can't have a rely
an enjoyable Relaxing time in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the point of going in there is
enjoying yourself and having a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: and relaxing I always say it's a work
area, but it should feel good to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and if it's frustrating If your gear
doesn't work if you're measuring equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH equipment doesn't work It's gonna
frustrate you get good shit so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy yourself and then cheap shit breaks
It is going to break you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy it again Replacing a dehumidifier or
repairing a broken air conditioner in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of a grow is a struggle The grow is
running the plants are relying on that We
[SPEAKER_00]: can't turn off the lights and you've
already purchased the air conditioner one
[SPEAKER_00]: time spent the time to install it Why
didn't you get a good one that we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to replace that bitch in the middle
of the grow and move?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants around and struggle and get in
there at the ladder while the lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: running It was so much easier if we spent
the money early on and didn't fuck around
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of my last pieces of advice on
saving you money in the grow room is to
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in Industrial equipment not cheap
Walmart shit not cheap Target shit skip
[SPEAKER_00]: the stores the box stores and get
industrial equipment We were building a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space an agricultural workspace
whether it's your home grow Especially
[SPEAKER_00]: your commercial grow don't go get the
cheap shit get industrial Stuff designed
[SPEAKER_00]: for greenhouses for commercial
horticultural production or it will break
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to stick just a basic piece of
gear that was made for your bedroom or for
[SPEAKER_00]: your office a dehumidifier for the office
If you try to put that in the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not gonna keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna get funky and gunky on the
inside It's gonna get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna keep up and it's gonna die
buy something quality get the good shit
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building we're building a workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not building an office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not building just a little It's not
like cutesy little grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it more as It's a functioning
industrial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get industrial shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna work and gonna last The good
shit works so much better and then people
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna have as many problems
people always complain when they buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap shit They're like well, I've spent
the money and my problems still exist It's
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz you didn't spend enough and I know I'm
trying to tell you how to save money But
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll save money by spending money up
front that may sound crazy But you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: how it works If you're the one of those
people that keeps buying the cheap shit
[SPEAKER_00]: buy the good one How many times you're
gonna deal with fix and shit just buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive One the first time if you can
afford it by the best you can buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time When it comes to buying air
conditioners for a commercial grow I
[SPEAKER_00]: always say I don't get one giant unit get
several smaller units that way when that
[SPEAKER_00]: big one When one of them breaks,
you've got a couple of backups you can
[SPEAKER_00]: limp along and keep it growing I've been
in commercial grows where the giant air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner broke and then it's been 110
in the whole grow Got to turn off half the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and try to make that happen if we
had just three small ACs Something would
[SPEAKER_00]: have kept us a little bit cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right I am rambling now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank my buddy double door big
shout out to Matt Matt kind of inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode He's like hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do an episode on how to save a
few bucks in the grow I think I gave you a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of ideas some of them for smaller
grows some of them of course for bigger
