[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm ready to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it so much, it's so goddamn lame.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I buy some hash and that shit don't
melt, it just turns into a black biscuit
[SPEAKER_04]: on the nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got the No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know we got so much fucking
No-Melt fucking Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the No-Melt Nebraska, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got that fucking big jar of No-Melt
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got the No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to fucking get rid all of this
No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes me sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to get rid of all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody please take my No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-Melt Nebraska, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: This PSA has been brought to you by the
great boys at Terpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can catch them on iTunes under Terpy
Boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their new album will be out soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it Terpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to start the show with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I've got an intro song and shit,
but I'm just going to roll with it from
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited that you have that
recorded because I'm going to use that in
[SPEAKER_01]: our store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play that in the butter room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you're going to play my podcast
a lot because it's the only version of it
[SPEAKER_01]: that will be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only going to let me have that one
I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm flabbergasted and thrown off pace by
that, but that's the greatest way to start
[SPEAKER_01]: a podcast ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much how you've got to do it
in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to do something unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't know my voice had voices like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like true sirens of the 710 world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got all kinds of emotions going on
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not want it to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all, ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing we want to stop- We could
do that for about four hours and we
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't done it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do the outro for four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got our special bread song that we just
made up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Special bread song.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about a new strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exclusive genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want to know the cross?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say before we get off topic,
we do want to make sure we say- No,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're cool man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to end the no-no Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nebraska needs to stop in this state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have stuff that melts.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just need to stop making no-melt
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about the no-melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get back on the J-Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get back on the J-Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the J-Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need to make a glossary of
terms to go with the podcast, but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not with it, you're not with it
today, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, let me explain what no-melt
Nebraska is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start it off with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's introduce you before you explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, speaking on the mic
right now that is about to give us a
[SPEAKER_01]: lesson in no-melt Nebraska is Jordan from
Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know about Turpex,
you've got to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been dabbing mad Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the past two or three weeks,
Turpex has put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dabbed some chem-dog nectar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'm going to turn it back over to
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No-melt Nebraska is basically any hash
that doesn't melt, essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if you were to imagine making
hash in Nebraska, most of it would
[SPEAKER_03]: probably not be very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was just we were thinking,
where's the state that has the least melty
[SPEAKER_05]: hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is exactly where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It ended up being Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the hash that doesn't melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just call it Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_05]: The song was derived when my friend Jordan
here came home with a bunch of no-melt
[SPEAKER_05]: Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had someone come down back when we lived
in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Came down from Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was talking for weeks about this awesome,
amazing granddaddy perp bubble hash that
[SPEAKER_03]: he was going to be bringing down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, when he brought that
down, turned into straight biscuits on the
nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drop it on the nail and instead of
getting a bubble, you just get... Nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: really happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the funion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sits there and goes to a light
brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really get any smoke in the
piece or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The face I'm making does not convey on
radio at all, but I'm making this face.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever smelled burnt hair,
I'm making the face that happens when you
[SPEAKER_01]: smell burnt hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our buddy John John just walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting... I fucking love this group
of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a dab for you over here also
after you take that full melt dab,
[SPEAKER_01]: or mostly melt dab, kind of melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say this for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't understand all of the
verbiage nomenclatures going on today,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely write in to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast and ask for a definition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my name is Richard and I don't
understand what that nomenclature word is
[SPEAKER_03]: that you just said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frankly, I'm offended.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody can be on the level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it's verbiage,
not verbiage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Verbiage?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's verbiage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Verbie.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a... I stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Captain Grammar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the nature boy, Ric Flair.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my mostly left over here, I'm going to
say, what's that, like 11 o'clock?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the 1130 position over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say... 1137.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you 1130 because that's
420 plus 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my buddy Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Grammy gaffer over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am ecstatic to finally be on the podcast
after months of fucking talking about it
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting called out by my boy,
Irie, for not listening and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen and playing it at our shop and
doing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally am fucking here spitting Grammar
on the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, finally here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in the Terp Mansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it the Terpy Trap House.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of a pigsty.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you haven't been to my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've invaded their dining area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stepped on their dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made myself home here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He literally just walked in, kicked the
dog, grabbed the email, and set up a mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog is asking for a kicking,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dog came right back and tried to hump
your ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want everybody to know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes it rough, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably smelled the ham wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you had to sneak in the word ham
wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get points for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want any more ham wallets,
not pocket, moose knuckle, ninja foot,
[SPEAKER_01]: spitting viper.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a grimy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we brought our friend,
the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only bring me for a reason,
and that's to not act my age.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you for getting ... You
set this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your fault that all this chaos is
here on the show, and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to give a huge shameless
plug to Green and Healthy Cannabis on 212
[SPEAKER_01]: South 21st Street in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I do work for a dispensary in
Pueblo, but they don't have the turpax,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I come up to Green and Healthy
Cannabis to get the turpax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the Shula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's Shula.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Shula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shula is raw, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Shula.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost as raw as the Brink.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're ever in Colorado Springs,
212 South 21st Street in between Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: and Cimarron, we're always there waiting
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stop on by.
Great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ample parking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all your freshest buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: John John's a sweet dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll hook you up real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always treat everyone very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good timing, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on for showing up right as we
started the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was glorious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a great timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to stall to wait for you,
but then that song happened, and I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: just...
[SPEAKER_05]: The song just lured me in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to grow with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got called in by the song.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if I can put this guitar
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're playing the guitar,
introduce yourself, dude, because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember your name, and I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go around the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys just merged out of the video
game room a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh shit, you got a real
podcast, and they came and joined the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gigi Fam is thick and thorough,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome to the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce yourself to the show,
please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm Daniel with Turpax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad to be here on the show tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one they call Flair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you like Rick Flair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, woo!
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that Flair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like that Flair.
[SPEAKER_01]: He like the nature boy, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throwing figure fours on them,
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, dawg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over here smoking a blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I barely smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happens when you're in the trap house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you got to take it back to 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we're going to get lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joints, blunts, dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down ... Well, Hunt wrote down a
few topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be the OCD guy in the group
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could read your writing,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to hit my inhaler?
[SPEAKER_01]: Beat you all to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get it to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so ... Yeah, Hunt is a ... That's
another topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hunt was recently diagnosed with asthma.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that going for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't walk upstairs that fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temporary asthma with bronchitis right
now, so I'm like off all the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a hand wallet problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely part of the spinning Viper
club.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is your hand wall getting a little sandy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got dehydrated from all the ... I was
wheezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wheezing in coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those ... Yeah, the Nebraska will get
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you were up in a helicopter,
jumping out of a helicopter onto a 1,400
[SPEAKER_01]: foot mountain on skis.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,400?
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,400.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two weeks ago I was ... Yeah, I might be
high and not know how to count zeros.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only 1,200 feet high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Ohio, but I think it's higher
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was just in Silverton like two
weeks ago doing a bunch of heli drops and
[SPEAKER_01]: skiing.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13,000 foot cliffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: With bronchitis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had acute bronchitis at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, still jumping out of the heli and
getting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you did last week, you're a
pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Hunt was on top of a 14,000 foot
mountain jumping out of a helicopter on
[SPEAKER_01]: skis and fucking five feet of pow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he has asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try this at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hitting an inhaler.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does three or four dabs and goes to the
inhaler.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cheating, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting ahead just like Schwarzenegger
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I hit that, boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to hit that shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me hit that nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that Arbutinol OG player.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it help you out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lace up another fucking hot nail for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mark Wahlberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually Mark Wahlberg is coming in
later, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming to the show.
That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt, since you invited me here,
I want to definitely make sure to take
[SPEAKER_01]: some time to rep all your companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're with the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me, give you a couple seconds to hype
up the Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I own a company that's called
Grammy Gatsby, TheGrammyGatsby.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check it out, it's a media
and lifestyle website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that's been started years ago,
there's now like a large portfolio of
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome people and brands that make up a
gigantic network all across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have Green and Healthy Wellness down
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Dispensary, Apothecanna,
Cannabis, Topicals, and Lotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apothecanna, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the dudes in the room, the whole
Turpex squad, how I get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own moniker here called The
Gatherer with the Turpex crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brought a party tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brought the homies in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's what, 50, 60 people in the other
room?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like 34 down here, and the VIP is
sold out at 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call this the Turpex labor camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all just up there packaging grams
is all they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, there's like the Cannabis Grand
Crew is a big, super high echelon,
[SPEAKER_01]: limited to 500 people in its event that
travels all over the country that I help
[SPEAKER_01]: produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Smokey Brand, which is Smokey
Socks and Smokey Clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta rock the Smokey Socks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Custom sublimated socks and sublimated
clothing plus knitted stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we source stuff for all kinds of
unbelievable brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get just about anything we want
printed on some socks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you want on a sock,
anything you want on a shirt, pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that you want in concentrate
form, anything you want in topicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything you want on a shelf, anything you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just now working on this 3D printing
company that's going to start up in Denver
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like whatever comes
through and how we can do it to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole network.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a personal request for
some Apothecanna.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend who she's got bad skin
and she would love a cannabis product or a
[SPEAKER_01]: more organic, healthy product to help her
clear up her blemishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get Apothecanna on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Super Salver Body Butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I didn't realize something was
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we made some already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does rashes, irritations, cuts,
burns, blisters, any of that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll do what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you touch that nail like a Wook
would, you know, you get that burn on your
[SPEAKER_01]: finger, go stick that sucker in some
Apothecanna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, you need a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a rig for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Mad Rob Rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked for a dab a minute ago and I
just shined you on because I was talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you were just like, you know,
keep eating my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just keep talking, keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you a dab when I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're good, when you say something
worth it, I'll give you a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a good dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, it's if you go to the
website, you know, follow us on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: at at Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a it's just a gigantic network of
people, much like Iry and Turpex and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, trying to be as community
based and making sure people are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: forward and being positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's tons of brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the guys that are in the room are
probably the most important ones because
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how we all make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bread, that bread, that bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear there's just we're just waiting for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about the key?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody know about the key?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can talk about the key.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2010, I started Grammy Gatsby in Aspen
and we only have about twenty five hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: locals in Aspen, something maybe three
thousand now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've left since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Aspen, it was this thing where like
all these people always had parties and
[SPEAKER_01]: cool shit happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Grammy Gatsby, I wanted to be
something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would throw a party every week
called Gatsby's Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, you know, big up all the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would do Gatsby's Garden every
Tuesday at a revolving bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that were like truly homies
and people that like were respected,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would hook them up with the skull key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open your parchment right by the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right by the bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know we had the skull key made that
we got like three thousand skull keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the guys in the room all
have one of the skull key.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thought was is that, you know,
the skull key opens up every single door
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Gatsby mansion allows you to go to
all the parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So initially it was started that the
bouncers in Aspen, if you showed them the
[SPEAKER_01]: key, wouldn't check your ID or make you
stand in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our parties were instantly a little bit
more hoity toity.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the locals, because they could just
walk right in and shine off in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, it's now evolved into,
you know, people all over the world have
[SPEAKER_01]: this little skull key on their key chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very nice connection point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when we have events,
there's a lot of keys in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the keys are out by themselves,
at least they know we're all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's admirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a neat little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stumbled on it on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does one earn a key?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, where's my key?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't going to ask that,
but I'm glad they stepped up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the keys now are only handed out
at the dojo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoes off, secret knock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoes off, secret knock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drum circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Famous fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoes off, secret knock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dojo temps down, turps up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drum circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turps down, temps up.
[SPEAKER_05]: All day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grows before hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was like marketing and
branding and this cool little thing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's, you know, I have,
I've broken one since then and have people
[SPEAKER_01]: send them to me and all kinds of just
crazy bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool to like, you know,
I think you have a key, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have a key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll get one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know where the dojo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to your new house,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You moved and I haven't been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we live a hundred and something
miles apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We meet up in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven one nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven one nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get down on that C-O Springs, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: West side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming atcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag white people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aliens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aliens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag no free time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you guys, everybody in this room is a
social media monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody likes to sit down on
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys, I feel like social media is
what brought my business, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm going to start a little
seed company and I put it up on social
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly it was like,
you've got one of the known seed companies
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys notice that from like being a
hash company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys see that a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram's a huge platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many followers does Turbex have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: 21,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, see that's killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've probably at 13,000 by the time this
airs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still close to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've been building that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That number for almost two or three years
at this point, three years almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, definitely about three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the exact Turbex account so they
can find it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Turbex Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: T-E-R-P-X-E-O.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an underscore anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just at Turbex Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great hash pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also make sure you follow Green and
Healthy Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys changed that Instagram or
something, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at Green and Healthy 719.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters gonna hate, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters gonna hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters gonna ain't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got kicked off twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we actually, yeah, we had three
accounts deleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're up to like, you know,
1,500.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd you get your accounts deleted?
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram's all about that non-life
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't do it to me, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been posting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a new camera and my picture,
my game has increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't squish me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of haters, dude, you reminded me,
you asked me when I got here why they made
[SPEAKER_01]: me change the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you again, because a lot of
people are new to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Grow Culture, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Grow like based on the iPhone and the
iMac and the iCult that it all is was I
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow Culture because you listen on your
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an educational entity that
does agricultural educational seminars or
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of shit for colleges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he goes for the inhaler.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole room looked at me like,
say something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that that Albuterol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that Albuterol OG player.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting all fucked up over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want me relating cannabis to
their organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kindly were like, please don't,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to steal someone else's
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all grown from our heart here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ups and respect for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to do what you got
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't want to, if that's their
name, I don't want to steal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That new logo is fucking crisp with the
readouts and the, you know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to a website called Fiverr,
F-I-V-E-R-R.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some young kid in Bangladesh made the
avatar of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another guy in Bangladesh pieced
the two together and made me the logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: 40 bucks for everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like all those callers that you get
telemarketing and whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably does tech support by day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does someone from Bangladesh even
sound like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about to look at you and be like,
are you going to throw out a Bangladesh
[SPEAKER_01]: accent?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not know how that would happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to, but it was just going to
sound like an Indian.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's racist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not racist over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we already got racist just by
talking about the cheap labor wages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not racist over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the one paying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just run a labor camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many, how many social media is the
Grammy Gatsby have around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in medias.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many followers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably like 3,500 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run about 10 different accounts for
other people as well that are probably way
[SPEAKER_01]: larger than we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, you want to look at
like, it's just like having a website or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to have, you know,
content is king as they say, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have the right branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have your shit together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not trying to put up pictures of
brick walls or other kinds of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or all kinds of weird things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you really want to have it together
so that it actually looks like what the
[SPEAKER_01]: brand needs to be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that way you can expose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I will tell you the one
thing that I've learned over the years
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it often is that your audience needs
to be able to watch your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how you said, you know, you blew up
on Instagram or how these guys have gone
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, Santa Cruz to Colorado and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be a part of that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew of Turbex before they ever had a
Colorado presence because of their cup
[SPEAKER_01]: winnings and Instagram stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Turbex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?
[SPEAKER_01]: Turbex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turbex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Turbex, somebody just passed a
rig to me and I've got a big chunk of Kim
[SPEAKER_01]: dog here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, uh, what other topics did I open?
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got all choked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I brought a bottle of Dr. Pepper into
the room and hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like collapsing with, with Wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's with the Dr. Pepper?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I will let some of the
other guys in the room talk about first,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's, I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do a lot of things, but there's
one thing about 23 flavors that makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: get a chubby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what I'm saying,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first, when I first moved out here
and met hunt, this guy pretty much most
[SPEAKER_03]: every time I saw him, he had a Dr. Pepper
in one of his hands, but then he,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he had to start getting all
healthy and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's eating kale salads.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually got me on it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we, we, we put the Dr.
Pepper's away for awhile, so it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: hard for him to sit here at this table and
watch you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jelly beans, lip balm, fucking drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make all kinds of stuff with the 23
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who saw that shot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anybody see that perfection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Left-handed bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lefty shot right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've looked at my bottle a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can even, it's like orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just smell it and be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long has it been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, probably like a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've cheated, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only had like two Dr. Pepper since
we, we gave them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, they had that fucking luxury
Dr. Pepper Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one I had was that, uh,
the W W E smack down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you though, if you go to Sonic
and get that cubed crushed ice shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: you get some Dr. Pepper special,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: That ice is something great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our partners is hooked on Sonic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hooked on Sonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag fueled by Sonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fueled by Sonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fueled by John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fueled by street tacos.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but that 23 flavor things is like a
nice, easy topic to get into though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because yeah, get your nail all fired up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we got to talk about Terps anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was going to give Terp,
you got to talk about Apothecanna and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to give these guys some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear in just in random conversation that
there are several bad-ass new products
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out in the future through the TerpX
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of them got my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I asked this while Jordan's
taking a mean dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pass that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and cough out some answers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, you know, we're, we've been
doing some experimenting lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, definitely got some cool new things
that we're going to be bringing out here
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have some, uh, some
electronic cigarettes that are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out pre-filled and not the
standard, you know, poly, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: PG or VG or whatever the fuck people are
cutting their, cutting their oil with
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want to call it, you know,
but it's just going to be- Do you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: tell us what you're going to use?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's going to be a couple of
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely going to be some,
some just regular BHO pens, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: that are available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's all going to be stuff
from the garden that we have, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: connected to our processing center.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll all be stuff that we're,
you know, cultivating specifically for its
[SPEAKER_03]: end purpose of, you know, being a
delicious electronic cigarette product
[SPEAKER_01]: grown for extract instead of just being
somebody's rejected material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that we're, we've got some
edibles that are going to start coming out
[SPEAKER_03]: here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a couple of people working on
them pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things, there's some things I
will even say we cannot say on air about
[SPEAKER_01]: the edibles coming out because there's
shit about to hit the fan one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I can't let him talk about all
those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another, another, uh, big thing is that
we're going to be going rec soon too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's, uh, that's one of the
biggest things that we've been working on
[SPEAKER_03]: lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you got Turpax is not available
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, as of right now, our processing
centers and, uh, Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_03]: which obviously, as you know, is banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any recreational businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get you guys down in the,
at the spot in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be a great addition to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're hoping by April 1st to be
processing recreationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we'd, we'd love to be running your
gear, your gear too up there for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetic, Colabo, Turpax,
get down, Glavi, Slavi, keep it,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it gangster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys actually have some of my
genetics in the garden day Turpax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to throw out hashtags,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to just say as many hashtags
on the show as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I am the sound bite gatherer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you guys trying to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it too heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it too loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get in the mic all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag advertising, hashtag Turp team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag bring the stash back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just got called out on my beard,
yo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you missed the Flanders mustache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all crushed when he shaved that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your badge picture is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't take you seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alec Baldwin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have sweaty balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have, I have a straight,
handlebar, curled mustache up in that one
[SPEAKER_01]: that I grew for months to try to get it
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best story about that one,
I told the boys, but when I got my picture
[SPEAKER_01]: taken at the MED, the little lady that
works the computer literally looked at me
[SPEAKER_01]: and she was like, how long?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was like, can I touch it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, she reached over and combed my
womb room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look like a man's wreck softball
coach.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to let it fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't going to touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are better if you just let
them pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hyped up Turpex a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's, you mentioned a bunch of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite one that you're most
excited about that you want to hype up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this mean give me a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what that sign language is?
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Hunt was giving me sign language
to say which one of these things he was
[SPEAKER_03]: most excited about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll throw you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to wipe your fingers off after you
do that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to touch you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a dab over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have everybody in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say we're pretty excited about the
edibles coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that we've been working
on for a while, but we just didn't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly some turp drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't want to hit the market before we
really had everything figured out,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially with how restrictive everything
is out here with the rules for making
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules keep changing every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's trying to shoot ropes like Peter
North on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They hit edibles pretty hard with that
hologram thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I win.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to dab on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely time into the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's it at?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The edibles are going to be on point once
we can actually say, and I will say it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go a little bit more in depth on some
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: My troll hand is fucking big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me on comments because I'll get
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but we're going to have some great
edibles coming through at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously with all the new products they
have coming to you, you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable way to get a comprehensive
medication on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ingest, you can smoke,
you can have something for the go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially with us being able to
cultivate strains specifically for
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hunting through some new CBD strains
here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already got a couple, but we've got
some that are going to be truly,
[SPEAKER_01]: truly unique terpium profiles on a lot of
shit that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw down something I think should be
high end CBD if it comes through for you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Toroboracross should be high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The uglier plants will be higher in CBD is
what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more of that like bamboo hemp
rope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people that are at home growing
hemp rope calling it cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's okay too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mids, mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpex edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long until you think I can have some
Terpex edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it going to be like chocolatey
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we even tell them about grandma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we tell them about grandma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't spill any beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job's to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't wear your headphones and take a
dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say like ... You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just fucking with you because it was
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like turning down the radio so you
can see better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a few things that we're making
this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sending everything to get lab tested
before it actually hits the shelf because
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't want any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to give me 500 milligrams
on accident?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch me do a merino doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can handle that, but most people
can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most people cannot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys can take the 1,200 milligram
challenge in a day, we'd love to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain the 1,200 milligram challenge to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like No-Melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a little bit of guitar behind
the background?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 1,200 milligram challenge is much like
No-Melt Nebraska in a sense where the name
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of gives it away, but there's a lot
more in depth about your passion for the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual event.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start off probably with maybe
400 to 800 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And slowly work your way up to 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, you go outside and
put your hands up in the air and scream up
[SPEAKER_01]: to John, thank you and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically like any other mental or
physical challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that you need to work
yourself up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just jump in at 1,200
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a couple of days at 2,500
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get a sponsor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get a sponsor for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need somebody to throw down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need 1,200 and then I need 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're at 2,500.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need 2,000 and then I need 600 for the
day before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to step yourself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do a 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done 350.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've eaten a 350 milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you that the way that I have
found best to imbibe the 1,200 milligrams
[SPEAKER_01]: is straight capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you open the capsules up and take them
while they're half open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just pretty much jump right
in like a land's carpet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time we were preparing for the
1,200 milligram challenge, I was actually
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was talking hell of shit on
everybody because I had been training
[SPEAKER_03]: really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was waking up every day and just eating
1,000 milligrams for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then having another cup of honor for
lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time that happened, everybody else
had been eating so many capsules too,
[SPEAKER_03]: training for the challenge that it was
just like, shit wasn't going well
[SPEAKER_03]: business-wise for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely have a very relaxed state
of mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one homie in Washington who was going
to be doing it with us, he broke two
[SPEAKER_03]: mothership minis in a week or some shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the exact story was that he
knocked over his mothership mini bubbler
[SPEAKER_01]: while he was trying to go to sleep and
also had a tornado of money blowing around
[SPEAKER_01]: on his patio or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you want to go straight to
the black diamonds at the mountain and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw yourself down a mogul.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,200 is serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,200 is no joke at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to make sure we were over 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really want to get intense,
you try to hit 2,500.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just silenced the room again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the gram dab of edibles is
what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't smoke, those are obviously
good ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really trying to get some sort
of sedation, for me it was just the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't have anxiety and I'm
extremely focused.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to never get sick,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we know, cannabis can cure everything
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you eat that shit, you're going to be
fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the other thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: We figured if we could do 1,200 milligrams
for a month, there was no way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: would ever have any pathogens,
cancers, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way anything would even get
into us because we're just super saturated
[SPEAKER_01]: in our cannabinoid system and our lymph
nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody throw down 2,500 pills or 2,500
milligrams of pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to figure out how that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take care of you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between all parties in the room,
I'm sure we've got this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have 2,500 one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not liable for what happens after
you hit 1,200.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as none of them are real high CBD,
have I told you guys about my CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: adventures?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you listened to the episode with CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are all extract artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys call yourselves now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is extract artist the term anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a word to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, everyone goes silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember extract artist was the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that term, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not crazy about that term.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are just hash guys, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're turp ex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are hash guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started doing this shit because we love
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the appropriate group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed if I smoke too much CBD,
I can't bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go full drunk wolf dick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still fucking ... Yeah, it just won't
... There's no end.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's birth control for fucking men.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not been smoking enough CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just nut too fast?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he just gets it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't smoked enough CBDs to really
perform that kind of research on myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I went to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a chick friend who was actually on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy should have go smoke a bunch of
CBDs and beat his dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the dispensary and bought a
bunch of CBD medicine and we smoked out
[SPEAKER_01]: and we went to the house and tried to
fucking shag and there was no ... It was
[SPEAKER_01]: fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both like, yeah, but like an hour of
just sweating on each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at her, I was like, I don't think
... She's like, Jim, just two wooks
[SPEAKER_01]: walking around in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wooking it out, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice little wook out for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think that smelled?
[SPEAKER_01]: About as good as his story about shitting
in his buddy's VW bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another podcast for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never found that with CBDs,
but I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I think it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't tend to lean towards the CBDs as
much as I'm looking for THCV and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll tell you what, I'm going to
try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once in a while, smoke a bunch of Sativa,
go jerk off, see how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait 24 hours, smoke a bunch of CBD herb,
go turn the whack one out and see if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just like three quarters of the way there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what ratio is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this might be something
patentable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually the Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 21% CBD or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 to one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring in the opposite of ... What happens
if GW Pharma is patenting a 21 to one?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are actually state cannabis
caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: G Pharma was like, oh, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's patent that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one will ever come again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what happens if you hit like an
81 ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if you just like turn into like
titanium Superman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to a nurse and she said,
I think she's a paramedic or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: and she said that there is an electrical
response in your brain that causes a
[SPEAKER_01]: seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that same electrical response in your
brain is responsible for your orgasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an electrical firing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smoke CBD, it turns that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you don't have a seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they code that receptor probably,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you're coding your fricking cum
receptor too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you're literally muting your cum
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just putting like a cover over it
so that it just can't ... It's like
[SPEAKER_01]: getting an elevator with no 13th floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The government's going to get a hold of
that and use it for fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: overpopulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just something I discovered
that we'd share.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you, if you do the ... I know
they grow a lot of hemp in China and they
[SPEAKER_03]: use that shit and it ain't working over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give John John a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: John John.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying CBDs will actually make
you last longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't come at all, to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to smoke more CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people need to be getting on them
CBDs then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a minute man, then get up on the
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get up on the fucking CBDizzles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all been under the minute before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's been times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: First one's always easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about getting back up after you fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a warm up run.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just take a Viagra.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you, if you do the 1200
milligram challenge, you'll probably have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'll be able to pay
attention long enough to even care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tug, tug, tug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play Xbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you're getting old and you get
bored jerking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again and again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one was easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten way off course here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been told that there is a
cannabis cup booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is some things in the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we talked earlier about all the
different brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokey Brand, one of the big badass
clothing companies that I have worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've decided to kind of do this road
show every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be manning up and running their
production for the Denver Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle, San Fran, LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll be doing, what is it,
Agenda and Magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: AEG, Big Gallery.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be doing varieties of high-end
fashion all the way down to cannabis cups,
[SPEAKER_01]: to glass shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this cannabis cup in Denver,
we will have a Smokey Brand booth that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be a really large island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's probably like four or five
brands that I'm not able to say yet
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll be in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be appearances from the Turpex
Boys and Apothecanna and Irie Genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think there's going to be a...
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys will be appearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be your booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if we're going to do a booth,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The MED, unfortunately, is... We're
waiting for some rules to come out about
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the brands that will be in our booth,
the Smokey Brands, they won't be licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have all kinds of clothing brands
and glass brands and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No smokeable, consumable cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will have their own smokeable,
consumable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't, as an MED licensed
business, I don't believe you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to have anything going on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think High Times just canceled the
medical side of it, too, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hearsay, but... There's definitely a
bunch of different rumors going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm saying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of brands that I will say
once they announce, but it won't be any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the staple cannabis brands that we have in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be more of the fashion, glass,
vape pens probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different stuff like that that'll be at
the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the homies and the Gigi fam
will be there dabbing out and having a
[SPEAKER_01]: great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of cool homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a great booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people in the room right now,
while we're getting down, along with some
[SPEAKER_01]: suicide girls and some other people like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look who's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just keep strolling in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to more Turpex crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be at the cannabis cup booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be at the cup roaming around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find me, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be at the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your booth called?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the Smokey Brand booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have our location yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't come out with the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you get there, if you want
to grab... There'll be Smokey Socks all
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a big pot leaf as a logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have Smokey Socks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a bunch of clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a bunch of all kinds of shit
set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there'll be a VIP inside,
GG fam, shoes off secret knock type party.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross and Jeff will be up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably won't have any seeds because
honestly, I'm going to a... I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to sound like a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a private party Friday night
between a bunch of seed breeders and
[SPEAKER_01]: traders and a bunch of invite-onlys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my seeds will probably be eaten up
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only seeds he'll be giving away are
the ones he's picking up for me on Friday
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean you've got a surplus of Irish
seeds somewhere?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a couple of packs in my
backpack when I start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there might be a couple in there
right now, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely... The Dubwise, the Black
Cherry Cam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we supposed to say the other ones that
aren't... Oh, you can talk about... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've given you anything, you can talk
about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Toribora Grape Snopper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Toribora Cross II King Snopper
Grape... King Cam Grape Snopper OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that's the mouthful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much, if you're in a new state,
if you're in whatever you're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can find the way to get some beans,
Irish Genetics is probably a company that
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work hard to keep stuff going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually working on the Black Cherry
Cam F2 right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually harvesting... I did the
phenohunt to find the female that I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to breed with, and I'm harvesting them
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I chose the right bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a purple one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need anybody else to help you
verify that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make selections?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that one of the biggest ones
that we all talk about is the Lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffery, because that's the one hitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaw-Free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've crossed the Lemon Jeffery to the
Grateful Dog, and there are arguments over
[SPEAKER_01]: what the name is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody want to throw out some?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: King Jaw-Free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give John John a mic for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, King Jaw-Free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag Game of Thrones.
Yeah.
See?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what... Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what my buddy said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else told me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get the reference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jaw-Free Chaucer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a real dickhead king.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they ended up... I'm a dickhead and
I'm a king.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag spoilers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up poisoning him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I slung him out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoilers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controversy on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tons of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon is so prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying... We got to taste
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love a taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll let you taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hanging up right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get that final trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of days in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's looking like that 70s bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to make some Fulmel or some
Nebraska?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I don't fuck around and it's
going to make some Turpex Shatter or some
[SPEAKER_01]: Live Resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Garden of Weed and Live Resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I flux with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not... I can make my own hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have my own vac oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I've got friends that let me use
their vac.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make some decent hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Garden of Weed and shout out,
boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live five minutes away from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make most of my hash for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since nobody's had a harvest for a
minute and we are hash heads and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked all our hash, it's been Turpex is
my second reliable source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Garden of Weed and Irie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody coming up from Pueblo that comes
to the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we send a lot of people up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to work out some sort of affiliate
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to start getting some credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we need to figure out a hashtag for
them to use when they come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fueled by Jah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fueled by Jah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sort of got to get that rec stuff
going for your spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them down there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I sent on another show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are in Denver or if you're in
Pueblo, drive to Springs and go get this
[SPEAKER_01]: hash because it's worth the 45 minute
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm up here once a week, usually on a
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to start coming on Fridays because
it's donut day, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that is... We do Dilla donuts
every Friday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dilla made us do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We play hip hop all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Amy's donuts in the lobby for all
the people that come through while they
[SPEAKER_01]: last.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got there quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got there early and they were gone last
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have waited to deliver that new
drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I delivered a new drop of flavors over
there at Close tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have came right when they opened
tomorrow so I could have got first pick of
[SPEAKER_03]: them damn donuts.
Fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, big ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Amy's donuts in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amy's donuts is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep us laced up with everything from
that Elvis with banana chips on it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry icing with the rainbow stripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to quit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a cookie butter one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a cookie butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a cookie butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half cookie butter, half chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have cotton candies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're on that healthy tip,
but you'll eat the donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: John John is my proof here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only had one donut this whole month.
[SPEAKER_01]: One donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that healthy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting all swole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got bronchitis and inhaling you
guys make fun of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually eat about two of them though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag sad face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag fatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag no shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you, we as a staff,
we get in there early on Friday morning
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's Dilla donuts, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put on some J Dilla and you let
Quasimodo and Doom play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw the music up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wolfing down some sugar at eight o'clock
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things get productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are doing cartwheels when I get
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slam a red bull, get after it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop in the shop, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to like three dispensaries on the
planet and this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate all the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys down there in Pueblo and
especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come down because that boy be on that
shula.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got that shula boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shula that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for our masterfully grown
crop to come in and that'll be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then probably like two
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now we have great flowers and
everything on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an unbelievable concentrate
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we're up to like 24 different
flavors of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I think we're at like 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't even say it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Durban poison wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck Norris is gone, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gone in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have the Gary Busey OG on the shelf
right now though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary Busey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duck butter coming soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the one that I want to know about
this name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Drake's hankership.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should probably put the Nature Boy Ric
Flair on the mic because that's his name
[SPEAKER_01]: that he came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear about this Nature Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually knows what's up with the
turkeys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get up on the top rope and tell me about
this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead silence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put him on the spot and fucked him up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This blue dream and white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually based on the video game
Uncharted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, because Drake is an adventurer
and he has a handkerchief.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real story.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got it out of him though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got it out of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some fucking, it was some flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some flow and some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we thought, you know, people are
going to cry when they fucking hit this
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just said, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who's like crying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, Drake fucking was playing
maybe on Pandora or something and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not playing on Pandora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say, I think that's the only
concentrate we will ever see that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: word hankerchief in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the name Drake, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pretty much said what I said and I saw
the drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, wow, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got to explain what genetics Drake
hankerchief is to everybody that comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, because hashtag fuck
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys out there with that
fucking DJ shortcut and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit and whatever else and talk about
that blue dream shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about that for a second because
since moving to fucking Colorado,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen more flow or shit that smells or
tastes exactly like fucking flow than I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen ever in my fucking life.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the bomb shit out here?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't, they don't like kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: The dogs trying to go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I mean, I think a lot of it is
the fact that like that blue dream just
[SPEAKER_01]: blows up like a balloon for people that
don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flow is super easy to grow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows outdoors really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say any dudes trying to get laid
with your chick, buy them the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girls love the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking love blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're, if you're a mediocre grower
and you need to pull some weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never grown weed before and
you're about, I think the flow,
[SPEAKER_01]: the flow that goes around here actually
came from DJ short, gave that cut to Ed
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosenthal, who passed it around to a few
people out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend, Tom, uh, had a dispensary
here and a dispensary in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he spread that out through his
dispensaries a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also went through other sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying he put it all over,
but that cut, I actually think is DJ's
[SPEAKER_01]: flow to cut and not flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think back in the 1940s, when they were
at somebody back in the day, they should
[SPEAKER_01]: have done that to blue dream.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dream should never exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I crossed the blue dream to the
grateful dog and I call it the blue
[SPEAKER_01]: healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it fixed blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made the, uh, made much larger grateful
dog nuggets and it comes out a lot like
[SPEAKER_01]: grateful dog, just better harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can polish a turd.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the part that sucks is I have to keep
a mother plant of blue dream in the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually we should get off a blue dream
and get onto some other strains that are
[SPEAKER_01]: probably better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know that we all dislike certain
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got that's coming down the
pipeline?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on this F2 of black
cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think you see the, I'm going to say
a name that I've never said on the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think if I say it, then nobody can
steal it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it'll be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit a dead head OG plant with
black cherry Kim pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to call it cherry Garcia
because I think that's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll spell it different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would definitely be down to
taste those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll run those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find a name for that lemon
Jeffrey grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on, I want to work for,
I'm looking for an arise male plant right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start using the arise as my
breeding staple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be my next boy that goes for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like my new stud for the next
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the terms like on that guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a golden goat crossed a daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sweet Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daybreakers a great plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, anything you put to the golden
goat makes resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just resin comes out of that
bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that male will make everything
resiny and stanky.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about something real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new thing going on all along
the social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about this rosin text.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually I have an interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ahead of ourselves in recording,
but I've recorded an episode that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: left a blank spot to throw in an interview
with soil grown so that I can learn a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully in the last episode that got
tossed in there, but the interview is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to happen tomorrow when I get
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is awkward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're traveling in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what CBD can do also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hold on with the rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's been around since like the
fucking sixties and the seventies,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like a lot of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily going to,
you know, they say that, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm out of the loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to know what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You take your weed and you put it in a
piece of parchment paper and fold it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a fucking nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hit it with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either hair press it or people are
using a t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sixties and seventies,
that's what would happen back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: is they would take that shitty weed and
t-shirt press it and be able to extract
[SPEAKER_01]: something they wouldn't call bubble hash
that would sell for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that from my time being a
cultivator in Tijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a story for a different day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get on that note after the asthma
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no solvent in there,
not even water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a neat tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's activating and expressing it as it's
heating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are still losing some potency if it
gets hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had a hair straightener I'd try it
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you activating it though?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is becoming decarbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're heating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're using like a hundred
degrees or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a hundred and six is where
decarbing starts right around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have nothing against it,
but it doesn't really do much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it does, it melts and it gets high
and all that stuff, but it's not the same
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: As an marijuana R&D specialist,
I think we should try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see some locals do it so that
I could take a dab of it and talk about it
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then there you have it obviously now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody go to the beauty supply store and
pick up a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at Walgreens today and I saw like a
whole fucking aisle of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be gone in the next
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took a couple of seconds and looked at
them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when Bed Bath & Beyond put the
dab torches, the little no stick mats and
[SPEAKER_01]: turkey basters all in the same area and
Pyrex dishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all in one little, they're like dab
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a computer program.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what people buy at the same time
and then they put it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to buy a controller,
a game and a headset.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it seems like people are buying a
lot of torches and turkey basters at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should put them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn Jews.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allowed to say that because I'm a Jew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you are Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested to see what happens next as
opposed to like going back into like the
[SPEAKER_01]: rising tax and all the other shit and the
CO2 and all the ice water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a call from a friend today.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is working on some sort of large scale
version of a hair straightener t-shirt
[SPEAKER_03]: press situation because he's like,
dude, this shit's dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been the big thing lately on the
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all people want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: His page is blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got mad followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mad, mad followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I just randomly thought
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a note in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday to Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode drops right before your
birthday or yeah, like right around your
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, Rob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening to this episode,
but I know you don't get a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're out there at the bowling alley
playing with your balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday to Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get back to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been way too much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took some show notes and Hunt wrote
down the phrase getting globby and put
[SPEAKER_01]: little marks by it or no, slabby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting slobby.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting slobby.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are getting slobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's congregate and get slobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pass you the rig so you can
get slobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it work?
Did it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get you slobby over here,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't look slobby enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can actually kind of tell that story.
[SPEAKER_05]: You trained him like monkeys.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I met Mr. Hunt was at a
cannabis cup in Denver and he came up to
[SPEAKER_05]: me and my partner Shane and he's like,
what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I think we should congregate
and get slobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: People all over the world are going to
say, let's congregate and get slobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually kind of turned into a joke at
the club.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually kind of turned into a joke at
the processing facility too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever, you know, cause we run stuff for
70 different centers or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some, you know, sometimes we get some
shit that just yields terribly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the guy, the guy, whenever,
whenever we run like a thousand gram
[SPEAKER_03]: column and there's just basically,
you know, there's virtually nothing in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking homeboy yell out from the back,
we are getting slobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and then, you know,
it's kind of like, you know, when all the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooters chicks come up and sing happy
birthday to you and all the same stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you got to have the same shit
going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago I went to guitar center
and I bought a piece of equipment called a
[SPEAKER_01]: compressor and I've never been happier
that I bought that because you did not
[SPEAKER_01]: blow out the rest of my equipment just
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not know that that was even
something I had to be worried about.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my job to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fucking, this compressor just paid
for its damn self.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, compressor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't let that, all that
microphone get to all of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're getting slobby, you do want to
get it up on like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get slobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slab time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sports fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can go steady globbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slab fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right before the show gets off the
rails, I'm going to do two commercials
[SPEAKER_01]: because I actually promise everyone I'll
do these ads really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go like this.

[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Alan and Jay and Sean and

[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be on point with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On point.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Alan and the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about you all before the
show, too, because I was saying that's
[SPEAKER_01]: some impressive shit that you guys got
going over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pun intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good shit over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're JT and the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: JT and the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lookout boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got lost there, but I'm just going to be
a blonde about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to dab on the dabber here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys get slabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over all your notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to let it get a little bit
looser.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I read the commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have been sitting over here
like little kids behaving themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got two, four, five grown men in the
room, plus a guy that snuck away because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's too shy for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play some guitar, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's get the guitar back going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe it's time for another song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a song while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk for another few seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll break into song.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll break into song.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like Joey P, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is probably time to give a
little shout out to Dr. Pepper for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsoring that they do for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they didn't pay shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pay for this bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shout that out at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever talk about Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until they're paying, they'll get a shout
out on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, we need to give a little
bit of a talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: stick-to-it-iveness and wherewithal of
everybody.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes out there we're noticing
that some of you wooks are slacking,
[SPEAKER_01]: slipping on your pimpin', as they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep your pimpin' strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go like this on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ashy pimpins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to bring an ashy pimpin'
for the low down, low ball price,
[SPEAKER_01]: you better make sure that bitch is frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the fuck that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I say half the time,
Hunt saying shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, whatever the fuck that means,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be a long episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fucking hang in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to touch on this wook chic
stuff that I've been seeing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these dudes with 35 hatpins,
homeboys that don't have no girls but
[SPEAKER_01]: drive a rental car and have slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, you got seven
motherships and a coil rig, but you got
[SPEAKER_01]: 8,200.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still up in mama's basement asking for
bacon every morning, but you got 35
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking rigs in the basement that you kick
it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get on the forums and get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking mad pendies with fucking opals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to harsh anybody's mellow
on the west coast or the east coast or any
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get down on the
motherfucking pendy rigs and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: wear all that crap, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that when you become a
grown ass man and you want to get grown
[SPEAKER_01]: ass man pussy, you got to put that shit in
a box and move it to the left like
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyonce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever the fuck that means.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Joey P. If you ever heard of
him, look him up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are getting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing the whole wedding,
cross your arms together and take each
[SPEAKER_01]: other's fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cute.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's illegal at Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be jealous, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peanut butter and jealous over there,
are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, peanut butter and jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting all up in your turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking jelly monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight up cooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All up in your turps, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been one of my favorite episodes
to record, and I hate to say that to all
[SPEAKER_01]: my homies back at home that record with
me, but you guys brought something to the
[SPEAKER_01]: table that hasn't been brought to the
table for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely a weird thing in this
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually sitting next to my business
partner and my father.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit just got weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking around the room and there's
nobody here old enough to be your father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there's an urn in the room,
that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's your father?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been nicknamed dad by pretty much
everybody in the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you the turp ex king, basically?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wouldn't say the king, but I would
say the fatherly figure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The godfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's little Anthony Junior from Brooklyn
that comes in every now and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: More like the guy who you call when your
battery's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need your car jumped.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need your car jumped in Fountain.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the good son.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the good son.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but you're the good son, but I've also
had to sit there and have discussions
[SPEAKER_03]: about birth control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got shouted out from the other
fucking room, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like the Brian Epstein of turp ex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag Beatles reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the manager of the Beatles and then
once he died they all fell apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: blamed it on Yoko.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the dude in the other room want to be
on the show at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting down on some turps over
there, but I would say hopefully,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to put together a star
studded cast for this so we could get a
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you guys will be back, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, we made it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hunt for helping me carry my
gear because this shoe's too heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get it out of the car by
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you need production or you need me
to line up some talent, bro, you just give
[SPEAKER_01]: me a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of talent you got, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you can bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shout out a name and I'll try to make
it gathered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get them all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get them all here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't call him the gatherer for
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get Addy back on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on episode number two and I sucked
at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be in town for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the guy that doesn't want to
come in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still getting some love.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me one time, he's like,
no, I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell he was like, nope,
I want to be in the back growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's about 17 dabs in relaxing after being
under lights all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, he deserves the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, we're going to get serious for half a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking today at the shop about
being under high intensity discharge
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt taught me something I never thought
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, cover your skin up in the grow
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in your own personal grow,
you're probably all right, but if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in a room with 20 or 30 or 40 or like I
work with, there's 120 lights in some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover your skin up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover the top of your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear some glasses.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting melanoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are seeing weird shit on their
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting like signs of sunburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their hair's falling out and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go blind in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some good glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only think about the glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover up your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely, you got to think
about exposure.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about sunscreen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that where?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's ... Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a dermatologist or a sunscreen
producer, so I don't know really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys aren't scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put one on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely something that's
been talked about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's the exposure rate that
you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a grow room for six to eight
hours a day, it's definitely great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have tattoos, so that's why I choose to
use ... I use long sleeves and hats and
[SPEAKER_01]: glasses and all that stuff because then my
ink doesn't fade and I don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about all the other stuff, but I have
heard from some of my homies that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cali early in Aspen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get down, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are tatted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're tatted up, it's one of those
sexy tattoo models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such sick tats, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, he is tatted up, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's tatted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shirt up.
[SPEAKER_01]: His pubes are tatted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shirt up is a lot of man meat for ...
Where his pubes should be, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: tattoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a Thursday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tattoo of pubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see the difference though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the difference in your arm
tattoos and your body tattoos from having
[SPEAKER_01]: a shirt and where you're exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude's tatted, guys, and you can ... I
know what you have to go through at the
[SPEAKER_01]: MED.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually like, do you think you
should formalize this?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just writing it on a piece of paper,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ask for all of your tattoos and what
they are and all that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, I literally had to sit down and
figure it all out, so I just went by body
[SPEAKER_01]: part and I just told them all the body
parts that were tattooed, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than a couple ass cheeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a $100 bill in my dick because I
like to play with my money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you want to find out if that's
true, come to the Cannabis Grand Crew in
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspen this November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag wiener tattoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I can say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next Cannabis Grand Crew is May 30th
in Seattle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: CannabisGrandCrew.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check it out and come
party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I can't make that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't ... It's captured 500 people and
it's going to be a great panel with
[SPEAKER_01]: different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless the Grammy Gatsby is paying for
that shit, you know, if I'm flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather go to the crew, so you fly me
out there and give me a hotel room and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get sponsored on that 2,500
milligrams, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'll donate my 25 over there and then
I'll just go out there to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting worked over on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag fam is fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fam is fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grammy Gats all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I hear a guitar just went
brink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're promised a song after a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the bread song going to come out today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the first global release of the
bread song?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I did this one on Call of Duty for
like an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, there's some people heard it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some 12 year olds on Call of Duty
that got the brunt of that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone got the live stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, we haven't practiced it in a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can try to lay something down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I probably got muted like five seconds
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I quit using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even play anymore because it's
just everyone trolling everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't even playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just singing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually, you know what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you get into the song though,
I mean, you guys did like a nice little
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty facelift over Turpex with the logo
on the website coming and all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did.
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually just got to me today and
changed it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I think it's definitely a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the website is going to have all
the places where we sell Turpex,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to ask if there was a
bunch of places you guys knew of where
[SPEAKER_01]: folks can get it, but it's only medical,
so I didn't want to tease you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll still tease all out of Stater's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll still tease all out of Stater's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says homeboys sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well just say Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there for ... They're in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hung out for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 30?
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hung out for somewhere between an hour,
30 and 40 minutes, maybe an hour today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And half the customers that showed up were
recreational people hoping to shop and you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to turn them away and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope Colorado Springs ... Yeah,
got to pass that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in Colorado Springs,
we would really appreciate it if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell the people that you can about the
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you feel like it and you're in
support of the cannabis movement,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously tell your local representative
what's going on because we don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: rec cannabis other than Denver and some
other places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or just get your card for now,
which sucks, but that's ... Or just if you
[SPEAKER_01]: need rec, go drive down to Pueblo and see
Mr. Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go down to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on down to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're trying new stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sports fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd get a chorus of monkeys,
but it wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just taking a ... Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you opened up the paper,
was to drop the getting slabby?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't want to say getting globby
again on accident because I wanted to read
[SPEAKER_01]: slabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you, if you're in the right
situation in an event and you yell out
[SPEAKER_01]: getting slabby, you will find out where
the terpy crew is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens to me often.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be at the cup and some random kid
from fucking no melt Nebraska is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go, getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my homies in distress and
you guys will go run and just be some
[SPEAKER_01]: Nebraska kid with 45 hat pins in a
mothership rig, walking around saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: knock off mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knock off mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knock off mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's with the mothership hype anyway?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I just sold mine for
almost three times what I paid for it back
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2012, so I was pretty happy about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hype is the fact that they're hard to
get and a lot of the people that are seen
[SPEAKER_01]: as the top OG, triple OG, OG of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be heady, bro, you got to have a
mothership, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of ... This rig hits pretty
well and it didn't cost my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit that thing numerous times and I
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you had to use your inhaler,
sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bring that fucker back over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sold my mothership for 10 months
rent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a pair of Jordans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that little rig was.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one named Eleven Breds?
[SPEAKER_01]: From the blower, instead of getting it
from some random distributor, Mad Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Mad Rob again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out 719.
[SPEAKER_05]: 719.
[SPEAKER_01]: 719, coming at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of the Gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not my shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was passed to me and I was told,
here, hit this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that and there's the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll make it all work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to TASC, highly educated
titanium.
[SPEAKER_05]: TASC Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly educated titanium, number one in
the biz.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about all the verbal diarrhea over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not my hash, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see you glob that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not taking you to the ER tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already told you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to get you an oxygen tank,
along with that fucking inhaler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be Mr. Burns and all the way down the
hallway with this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody know CPR in this room?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my inhaler.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was certified like four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably hadn't changed that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just stomp on that middle part of his
chest until he breathes again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, grandpa gas, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't CPR be like, I need that bad moon
and rising in that CPR?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, different band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's CCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind, that's CCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nice try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe you actually grabbed the
microphone for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to say this, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love kicking it with Jeff because he
goes to comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an awesome sense of humor,
but the homeboy's timing is impeccable
[SPEAKER_01]: with most of his shit when he's dropping
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The take out your retainer bit,
I wish we were recording for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was about to take a little hit of his
albuterol because he was choking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was wheezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him if he had to pull out his
inhaler to hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's trying to psych.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or pull out his retainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a psych out like baseball right
there, little bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good when I'm on it, but when I'm
not, boy, it's sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave you a compliment about timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that fucked everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting globby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ruined it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting globby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That rescues it all right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget when you're out there by
yourself and you don't know what to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: temps down, terps up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temps down, terps up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that nail cool down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop that dab on the nip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop that nut on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop your nuts on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put them in apothecana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put those in apothecana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you know the nail is just
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apothecana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put the dab on there and you
get a little pubed taste and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, it's delish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like no melt mixed with Terpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ball Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ball Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag sac terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sac terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wook terps.
Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you I was going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's verbal diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, it's a symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to cue the guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to cue the guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've had enough dabs that it's
probably bread song time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've smoked more in this hour
sitting here talking to you guys than I
[SPEAKER_03]: have in one sitting in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how the Grow From Your Heart
podcast happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dab it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's all my dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody has got to hoist the microphone
in front of the guitar so that we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: some audio.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember this one, Pops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless somebody's got a- You know it,
son.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a quarter inch cable,
I could jack you straight in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get me on the sexual in here,
jacking him straight in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just mic you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mic him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd turn up the gain and mic you up
a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny with the banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag super puns.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a turbtastic episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's AZ up in this room now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get out of control with music,
I'm really going to thank you guys truly
[SPEAKER_01]: before we get all ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, fucking thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my better episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get a lot of listens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get this fun vibe on the show
when we get everyone too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this many people, it was super
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, being high or whatever,
I just had a fucking dope time kicking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever want to come back over to the
fucking turp trap house to get down,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're here.

record again tomorrow.

[SPEAKER_01]: Pause for the slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag slabbing and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was by far the hardest I've laughed
in a fucking long time on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he went in, did you hear what I said?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just snotted out my nose into my fucking
mustache.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be a fun one.

Police soundtrack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the best things I fucking
heard all week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to turn my microphone off because I
was laughing so hard I was snorting into
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Told you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That first one you hit, I fucking blew it
all over my mustache.

his tears in.
