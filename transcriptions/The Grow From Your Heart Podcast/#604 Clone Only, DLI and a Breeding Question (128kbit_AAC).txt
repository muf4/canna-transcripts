[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is episode 604 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a few
Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a few shout outs to a few members
of the 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 club are the folks who
support us on Patreon at the $7 and 10
[SPEAKER_00]: cent a month level or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's start off
with the big grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you shout out to our friend 13 spark
13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
dab squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shot at the
Zoso J.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a special thank you to Noah
and let's send a big grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I did include that link in the
show notes and in the video description,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know a lot of you are listening
while you're driving to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself in a car crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can support the show later at patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm talking about Patreon,
let me talk about something I posted to
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been brought to my attention that
sometimes when I do shout outs,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not shouting out the name you would
prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm doing the wrong name,
because that is what you signed up for on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like me to give you a shout
out at a different name, all you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is send me a Patreon message or an
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just say, Hey Rasta Jeff, I signed up
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using 13 spark 13 on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer that you call me this and I
will make sure to use your preferred name
[SPEAKER_00]: for shout outs on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, one person has already corrected
me and Hey bro, I lost the note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where I put that note.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to send that to me
again and let me know what you'd like me
[SPEAKER_00]: to call you for the shout outs on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just send me a message on Patreon or
send me an email at grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make sure to make a spreadsheet,
make some sort of notes that say this
[SPEAKER_00]: person wants to be called this and I'll do
my best to remember when I give you shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to respect people's privacy and also
give you the shout outs you asked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me I'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to read a few Patreon
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the Patreon messages
for this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one comes from they want their
name said they didn't sign it with their
[SPEAKER_00]: full name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to read their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Hey Rasta Jeff, I hope you're
doing well brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am great and thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I was wondering about
Durban poison seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always told it was a plant only but
I'm seeing seeds for sale online could
[SPEAKER_00]: imposter seeds be a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said plant only but the actual
phrase that we will use in the industry or
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis scene in the community
would be clone only Durban poison was what
[SPEAKER_00]: was known as a clone only there are plenty
of plants out there that are clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: and I talk about clone only plants all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what clone only plant
means in my definition in our scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that say I breed a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that I took I want to talk
about something I've never released and
[SPEAKER_00]: never put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's actually clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I took a golden goat female and
reversed it made a male out of the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pollinate the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got golden or L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush to golden goat at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fem seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a plant that I really really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant then I don't grow any more of
the seeds or I toss all of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that I grew that one L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush to golden goat is now clone only
because it's the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't release any seeds of it if I
don't have a male of that plant the only
[SPEAKER_00]: way that that plant is available is
through clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that becomes what's known as a clone
only strains like Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a clone only the form cut the thin
man cut whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a clone only gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's got the number four at the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josie Wells had a few gorilla glue
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He selected the number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't any more seeds after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be no more breeding to make
more of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there was another number that
was a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chose to go with the number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gorilla glue number four got spread
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no male of the gorilla glue to
breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to make seeds of that
that are not a gorilla glue out cross or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than something I'll talk about in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a clone only is something that a
breeder made and never released seeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only released.
[SPEAKER_00]: She may have also only released a clone of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no seeds put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to talk about things that
make it possible for you to have that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat is a clone only until I came
around and made feminized seeds of the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really easy to make unadulterated
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seeds that are not imposter
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did, I took the original golden
goat clone only popular clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat it with a solution which I talked
about in a very recent episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat it with silver thiosulfate a
number of times on a schedule and a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific ratio and dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That creates feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then put that feminized pollen on
another clone of the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not adulterating the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is golden goat to golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that come out are unadulterated
golden goat as swans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have self to that golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible to make feminized seeds
of a clone only strain that is possible
[SPEAKER_00]: and very likely, especially with something
like Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much Durban poison was
clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a an African land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of rumors and myths and
legends around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are a lot of seeds of that
available if you're privy to where to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for those sort of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know who to ask, especially if
you're from the Durban area, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds are abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could be imposters, but it is
impossible that they are feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are true Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it is likely that they are real
Durban poison seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ed Rosenthal was putting out
Durban poison seeds through Sensei Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed might not have been involved in that,
but I do remember Ed and Sensei Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company or somebody putting out the Durban
poison seeds a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My memory is a little foggy on some
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be real Durban poison seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another option is it could be a back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about back cross for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made golden goat feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are not fond of running
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that they are going to be
problematic or they are just more into the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural male female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people also wanted golden goat seeds
in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best thing for me to do was to make
golden goat BX, a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is attempting to make a replica of
the original golden goat, but I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterate it by introducing a male into
the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a male plant that was vastly
different in every way from the original
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pollinated that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated the golden goat with that
male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got something that is basically,
if you're going to think in colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: one was red and one was blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we cross them, when I'm looking
for the red phenotype that represents the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat, it was going to be very easy
for me to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their traits were so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were red and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very easy for me to tell the
difference in the progeny when I grew them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew out the plants that came from
that cross that it was a daybreaker male
[SPEAKER_00]: is what I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a different daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to avoid that whole rabbit
hole there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the daybreaker to pollinate the
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made the first round of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds then made, I found a male in
that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lost for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male in that batch of seeds that
looked identical to the female golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So daybreaker male pollinated the golden
goat female seeds came out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used those seeds to search for a male
that looked exactly like the original
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew the same height, the same width.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the same branching structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves were exactly the same size and
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The serrations on the leaves were exactly
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reacted the same way to Kalamag
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reacted the same way to being topped
and manipulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant was basically a mirror of
the female golden goat, but it was a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point I took that boy and
pollinated the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intention now was that these boy
genetics and these female genetics are so
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly golden goat that what I create is
going to be a large percent golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: very dominant, very, it's like a replica
of the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was successful because the way that
I went about that first crossing was by
[SPEAKER_00]: making a very obvious out cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would know what I was looking for in
the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a male, you adulterate the
original cross, then you find a male from
[SPEAKER_00]: that progeny and pollinate the female,
the original female in an attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate the original cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I've done with the golden
goat back cross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next method would be to run those seeds
again and find another from that BX one,
[SPEAKER_00]: run those seeds and find a male that again
represents that golden goat female and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would increase the likelihood of
getting that perfect golden goat phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very likely that those Durban
poison seeds are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would check with the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's a reputable breeder that
you are working with, but the Durban
[SPEAKER_00]: poison has been around in a commercial
environments and the underground
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation scene and the gray market and
the free market for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is quite possible that that one is
out there and available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you see people trying to sell you
something like golden goat number four,
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seeds, that's when you need to
question things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them selling Girl Scout
cookies, regular seeds, that's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: question things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are clone only plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a clone only is something the
breeder only put that clone out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never put out any other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never put out a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clone only, not available in seed
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got a good flow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question comes from,
it says use the name Baz.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Baz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Oh, they've got a, this one came
from the website where we've got a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you about the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to iregenetics.com, there's a
tab that says grow help click on that tab,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill out a few short questions,
tell me what's wrong with the plants and I
[SPEAKER_00]: will do my best to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one of those questions from the
grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Baz is growing a strain called
crystal candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing it indoors under led
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've got a lot of details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those details are not going to matter
because I already know the answer to your
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem it says the leaves are
drooping the last few hours of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights come back on, the plants
seem fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a thing known as the daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants know that the light is going
to go off in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of programmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know the light comes on at this time
and the light goes off at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're starting to say, Hey,
Hey bro, Hey sis, it's probably bedtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start calming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should get some tea, start reading a
book and settle down for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start finding a blanket and a pillow and
start chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that the daily light integral
they've got, first of all, they know the
[SPEAKER_00]: light is going to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is they've gotten enough
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, Hey, that's all the light
I'm going to take for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need more photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't photosynthesize anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken what I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants are getting enough light
and they also know that sleepy time is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just getting lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking a little bit of a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nothing to be alarmed about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the reason that it looks good right
when they wake up is because now they're
[SPEAKER_00]: awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to start working again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to dial back a little bit
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to reduce the amount of
PPFD that these plants are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants, if your lights are
dimmable, you may be able to dim it just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, maybe raise it just a little
bit, or maybe reduce the amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: hours you were giving these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't want them to go into
flower too early, but that may help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out because they are getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to waste electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're already telling you,
Hey bro, I'm ready to go to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like a solid hour before you turn
off those lights, you may be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like 30 minutes, then I may just
leave it the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're saying, Hey, I know it's
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go to sleepy time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you got a healthy garden going on
and they're on a good schedule and they
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Baz hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just adjust a little bit of lighting
so you don't waste any electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend,
Alabama man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one was from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a two part question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one says Mr. Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff, most of your strains share the word
tall and their description, starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: your shortest variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you please name the five shortest
plants in your lineup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a shortest, a short ish
arthritis pain killer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is a really great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I replied with unfortunately most of
what I breed is like a, uh, a sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant kind of a skinny leaf to a thin
leaf, uh, kind of a hybrid of mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa dominant genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are going to get quite
tall on you for shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably recommend Prana morning
dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I may say something like,
um, what was the other one I recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana and morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the orange gas almost stay
short if you don't veg for too long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's, oh, a sun kiss is the other
one I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those are what I've got for shorter,
although they are going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to prevent too tall of a
plant, that's when you got to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep anything short if you scrog
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to work a scrog canopy,
uh, maybe a two or three layer scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the first one is to spread them out
instead of getting them growing up tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put that scrog down and make them
go straight out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you let them grow up a little bit
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second one is to kind of support the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one is to really give
you some support for tall colas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can run anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scrog it down, learn to work it,
manipulate it, bend it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can figure that part out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, arthritis, I think the arise is great
for arthritis, although it's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe try morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be a great all around
Indica sativa hybrid that will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some nice pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't get too tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a second part of the question and
it says, Mr. Jeff, would there be any
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit realized if a grower saved the
pollen from a male plant of a regular pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of iry seeds and then use that pollen on
selected buds of a female plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get free seeds for my trouble,
but would those seeds be stable mirrors of
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so they are asking if they took pollen
from a male plant, from a regular pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a regular pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find a boy, you collect the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are on the path to breeding already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, later use that pollen on select buds
of a different female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how we start making new crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you may make gold or you may make
something that isn't gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may make something that is mediocre
and okay, or you may make a bunch of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that you end up wanting to throw
away a likelihood of that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using iry crosses, you're very
likely going to have good success because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done good work before you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've set you up for success by selecting
good breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred with them, sent them along to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are good breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yes, basically you would get good
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question here is, uh, would those
seeds be stable mirrors of each parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of depends on the breeding
stock, which you start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started with, if you start with pure
iry genetics, you may breed yourself into
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I breed has got a rise in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that King Solomon in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you breed, uh, if you bred the arise
to strawberry starburst, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot of arise dominant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed strawberry starburst and blue
raspberry truffle, there are two arise
[SPEAKER_00]: parents in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get some arise dominant
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take that, uh, the male and put
it on something that doesn't have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: parent in there, yes, you are opening up a
lot of options for great breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you going to get mirrors of the
parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find some phenotypes that look
just like the mommy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find some phenotypes that look just
like the daddy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will find some phenotypes that
are the perfect 50 50 mix of both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to find everything in
the middle of those also, depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: large of a population of seeds you can
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to start seeing
the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make quite a few seeds in very
small plants just by pollinating one
[SPEAKER_00]: branch or growing just a little tiny
plants and pollinating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make plenty of seeds for yourself
to experiment with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stable mirrors of each parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see phenotypes like the
mom, phenotypes like the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see 50 50 mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to see everything in
between something that's a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: mommy, but looks like daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's a little bit more daddy that
looks like mommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on which traits in those plants
are dominant and recessive in which pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you're also going to see is
representations of the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mom plant also has a mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dad plant also has a mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see varieties of those
popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know what the grandparents are,
it's more obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see those things because I've got the
whole family tree going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've created them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with them for so long that I can
identify grandparents and great
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents and the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will see, uh, yes, stable parents,
stable mirrors of each parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to see random
representations of grandparents and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about which plants you select.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things give you wild phenotype
variation and some are very uniform from
[SPEAKER_00]: the first cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get wild variation, pick your
favorite female and your favorite male out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the population and breed them and then
do it again and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll narrow down to the traits that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you may find stable mirrors of
each parent, but you're also going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find, uh, outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find things that look like
mommy, things that look like daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep saying that 50 50 and then
grandparents and then maybe just maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: will find some grandparents there in that
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
