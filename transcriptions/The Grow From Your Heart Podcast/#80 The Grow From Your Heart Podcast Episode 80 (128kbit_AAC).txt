[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of news articles for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the news articles,
I want to talk about something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to go, but I definitely
jumped on the internet and saw some
[SPEAKER_00]: replays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead did some shows in Santa
Clara this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a
huge Grateful Dead fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead has a lot to do with who
I am and why I am who I am and what I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a Grateful Dead fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a Jerry Garcia fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a Jamrock fan since the early
90s, probably 93.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to say 95 because I moved
here late 94, early 94, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, my first fish show was 69.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been listening to The Dead,
Fish, all of that stuff heavily,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily since 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole bunch of fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my best friend, Rob the Dude,
did a whole bunch of widespread panic
[SPEAKER_00]: shows one summer, summer tour 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did about 20 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The Grateful Dead is a huge part of why
I am who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot of things on fish tour
lots and further festival parking lots and
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I watched these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The Grateful Dead got back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Jerry Garcia is no longer
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been gone for several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So filling in Jerry's shoes was Trey from
Fish, which you would think that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: most of Fish and Grateful Dead fans
biggest wet dream, but it almost it was so
[SPEAKER_00]: overhyped and so big that it just seemed
weird to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a big commercial thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey was the dude to choose, but it was
almost it put up so much hype and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation and so much pressure that it
was just weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watching the I didn't I didn't go to
the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have gone, but that was it's
hella expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel like it'd be right to go
take a week off to go to some shows right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did watch them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first two shows that they've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys have never done a show
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the first two shows they've done
in public and they've got three more shows
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up over the Fourth of July weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was totally satisfied with what I saw,
but it seemed really weird watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like watching a Grateful Dead cover
band do Grateful Dead songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't feel natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something wasn't meshing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a leader to that band is
something that I think I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That band doesn't have a solid leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby's trying to lead the band,
but it doesn't seem like he's able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: control because no one wants to listen to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey seems timid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to let loose and solo like
he should.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the end of the second show,
it felt like everything was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the end of the second show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the end of the weekend and
everything was wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that by the time they get to
the Chicago venue, by the time this show
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out, they will be in Chicago and
they will be setting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have already even played.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this will come out on
Thursday or Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how things go, but I hope I can
get it out for you by Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some improvement to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they talk about what didn't work
while they're on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they figured out by the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that they saved up the better
songs that they practiced for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying the set list over this
weekend wasn't amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the songs were great, but I'm
hoping that they saved up some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more...
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey didn't sing, but for one song this
whole weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping they got more Trey songs
lined up for the Chicago shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that we get to hear Terrapin
Station with Trey on vocals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several that I would like to
hear Trey sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably boring the hell out of a
lot of my fans with my Grateful Dead talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people listening,
but the Grateful Dead is a big part of who
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead, they're going to
Chicago over the Fourth of July weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend named... His name is Tim
and he actually has a company that sells a
[SPEAKER_00]: product called a Torchless Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it Torchless Dab Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been very curious about this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tim was passing through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim does not live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in another state, but he was
passing through my town and he was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim, if you're passing through,
dude, you're always invited here to come
[SPEAKER_00]: take some dabs at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't have cool toys with you,
even if you don't have top shelf extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, you're always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not purchase one at this time,
but I will in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's in my budget or
my need right now, but when I'm ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I'm going to grab one of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Torchless Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a dab nail that attaches to any rig
that is basically battery operated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a battery pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The battery pack is kind of big and kind
of cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, it's the size of a
remote control, but it is heavier than a
[SPEAKER_00]: remote control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you used to drive RC cars, it's like an
old RC car battery is what it reminds me
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you plug in, this thing has a plugin
that comes undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't always have to have a cord
hanging from it, but you plug it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the coil attaches to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the coil attaches to a bowl
piece, which fits onto your bong or your
[SPEAKER_00]: rig or whatever you want to call it,
whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attaches to your glass piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the battery pack has a button.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hold the button, it heats up an
element inside of the bowl piece that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes your hash, your shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we tried on it was shatter and butter
and wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not try solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't try anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only know how this works for shatter,
wax, and some buttery type hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put plenty, and you can stuff this
thing with plenty of hash too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of hash on there,
like probably a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you push the button and hold the
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as you push it, the hash
starts melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes like, it's a very little delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start toking, and once you start
getting smoke into your lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you start feeling it, then I started
kind of feathering the button,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like let it go, hold it, let it go,
hold it, let it go, hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like to take a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I noticed is as soon as you let
go of the button, it stops cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as soon as you let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really control your dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the part that I was concerned with,
and it did pass my inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that before I go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that I was concerned with is
we've got a wire that goes to a bowl and
[SPEAKER_00]: that bowl is heating something inside of
the bowl where I'm keeping my extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was worried about heating polyurethane
wiring or whatever was inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Tim gave me the liberty to
take this piece apart and inspect it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside of there, it's a glass bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks kind of like you're in a normal
bong bowl, or if you've got a health stone
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe, it's very similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glass bowl with basically a
titanium screen inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wrapped around that titanium screen
is, and we weren't sure if it was copper
[SPEAKER_00]: or brass, but wrapped around that titanium
screen is a copper or brass coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like an alligator clip or
a battery clip for your car, like where
[SPEAKER_00]: your car battery goes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like that wrapped around a
titanium disc placed inside of a glass
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you press the button,
that copper or brass element essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: heats up around that titanium disc because
of the electricity flowing through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It heats up and that's what melts your
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as you let go of it,
you can touch the glass and it's not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hold the glass while you take your
dabs and it won't burn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to maybe think about
dabbing in the car on the road and you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to use the torch, this device
would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just push a little button and you
inhale and you get pretty healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty chunky rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say the torchless nail is Rasta
Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it at least a solid four
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could play with it again,
I would give it five full stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done a real full rating test or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a rating scale, but on a
scale of one to five, I'm going to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: a solid four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I get to play with it a couple
more times in and learn the button
[SPEAKER_00]: feathering, the technique, how much to
push and let go, that sucker just might
[SPEAKER_00]: get five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to compare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take my normal rig with me for a
day and take the torchless nail with me
[SPEAKER_00]: for a day and see which one I end up
hitting on the second day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like day one, maybe I'll get tired of
torching, maybe day two or day one I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get tired of pushing the button and just
see which one I like better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's enough ranting about the
torchless nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in the torchless
nail, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put you in touch with my friend who
distributed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get you the best deal
possible since I just advertise them very
[SPEAKER_00]: well on the podcast for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not pay me to say any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought the nail to be kind to let me
check it out because I told him I was
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening, thanks for bringing
that big shout out to Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy late birthday, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope everything's going well for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some news articles,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On two podcasts ago, our buddy Mike was
here and we talked about a rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rate where the police officers used a
battering ram to bash in the door of a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary that the dispensary was open
and the door was unlocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they proceeded to treat all of the
customers like criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nobody was committing a crime,
they were actually there to serve a cease
[SPEAKER_00]: and desist order is what they should have
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead they went in, they treated
everybody like criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They destroyed most of the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cops were complete assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I thought they did was completely
disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently some other people did too,
because there is a news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This news article comes from abc7.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this on a lot of different places,
but this article was the best written and
[SPEAKER_00]: the most understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kept to the point the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it mentioned some things that a couple
of other articles did not mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse my coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into the news article
here right after I take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was a long drink, but shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This news article comes from abc7.com and
it is written by a man named Greg Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article was posted June 15th,
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Long Beach, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lawsuit was filed Monday by attorney
Matthew Pappas on behalf of Sky High
[SPEAKER_00]: Holistic accusing Santa Ana Police
Department, the city of Santa Ana and
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Ana mayor Miguel Pulido of taking
bribes from marijuana dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange for favorable treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This following a controversial police raid
at the marijuana dispensary on May 26th
[SPEAKER_00]: that was caught on surveillance video and
shows police playing darts, an officer
[SPEAKER_00]: making demeaning remarks about an amputee
and another officer eating what appears to
[SPEAKER_00]: be potlaced edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you listen to the podcast,
we watched the video last time and I'm 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that that dude ate an edible right
off of the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two cops ate edibles right off the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it's deplorable that city
officials and people seeking financial
[SPEAKER_00]: gain would use the police to accomplish
their self-serving goals, Pappas said.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a news conference in Long Beach,
Pappas outlined the lawsuit he filed in
[SPEAKER_00]: federal court.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suit alleges that Padillo and other
city employees favorited certain
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries over others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Santa Ana used a lottery
system to select 20 pot shops to operate
[SPEAKER_00]: legally under a new voter approved plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawsuit alleges that at least one
dispensary which paid Pulido was selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dispensary paid for their fucking
spot in the lottery, which is shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dude allegedly, allegedly,
I have to use the word allegedly,
[SPEAKER_00]: this dude allegedly took the damn money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky High Holistic did not win a spot in
the lottery and its patients allege that
[SPEAKER_00]: because Pulido and other city employees
had financial ties with competing
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana dispensaries, they use their
positions to close down the competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: including shutting down power and water
services, the suit said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pappas released an edited surveillance
video last week showing what the lawsuit
[SPEAKER_00]: describes as excessive and unreasonable
actions by police officers during the
[SPEAKER_00]: raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will agree with both of those
statements, excessive and unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suit said officers caused more than
$100,000 to video surveillance equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: safes, furniture, doors, and other
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: An internal investigation by the Santa Ana
Police Department is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retired LAPD Deputy Chief, Stephen
Downing, echoed the accusations at the
[SPEAKER_00]: news conference Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police officers should not behave that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unprofessional, Downing said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulido released the video statement Monday
afternoon in response to the lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These allegations are unequivocally false
and the city will be responding to this
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said he has no financial interest
or stake in any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article was from the Associated
Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Associated Press did contribute to
this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to mention that part at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are suing, they are going to file
a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have filed a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Against the cops that did this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully they don't get away with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this sets a new standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe this will make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have cops raiding places and
eating edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did over $100,000 in damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they sue these guys for what,
like three or four times that because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have to recoup
your losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to catch up from all
the business that you've missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hope they sue them for at least
three or four times this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to another news
article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is next?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from, ooh, right here at home,
the Pueblo Chief Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Colorado workers can be
fired for using pot off duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is from Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written by Kristen Wyatt of the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says pot may be legal in Colorado,
but you can still be fired for using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state Supreme Court ruled five to one
months ago that a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: patient who was fired for failing a drug
test cannot get his job back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case was being watched closely by
employers and pot smokers in states that
[SPEAKER_00]: have legalized medical or recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado became the fourth state in which
courts have ruled against medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients fired for pot use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme courts in California, Montana,
and Washington state have made similar
[SPEAKER_00]: rulings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump in here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article kind of frustrated a lot of
people, but honestly, nothing has changed
[SPEAKER_00]: with this new ruling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado has always been an at-will state,
which means you can be fired for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be given a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your boss can walk up and say,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your last paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at any minute, you can be fired for no
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an at-will state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if they did find cannabis in your
system and it was legal, they could still
[SPEAKER_00]: fire you if they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could just say, ha ha, you're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all right, let me get back into the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado worker, Brandon Coats,
is a quadriplegic who was fired by Dish
[SPEAKER_00]: Network after failing a drug test in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company agreed that Coats wasn't high
on the job, but they said they have a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats argued that his pot smoking was
allowed under a state law intended to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect employees from being fired for
illegal activities off the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats didn't use marijuana at work,
but pots intoxicating chemical THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pots intoxicating chemical THC can stay in
the system for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, these guys used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the word chemical is
appropriate there, but we'll just let them
[SPEAKER_00]: do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go on with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado justice ruled that because
marijuana is illegal under federal law,
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats' use of the drug couldn't be
considered legal off duty activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no exception for marijuana use for
medicinal purposes or for marijuana use
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted in accordance with state law,
the court wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats and his lawyer said after the ruling
that the decision at least clarified the
[SPEAKER_00]: matters for workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm very disappointed today,
I hope that my case has brought the issue
[SPEAKER_00]: of use of medical marijuana and employment
to light, Coats said in a statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorneys for Dish Network and the state
of Colorado, which filed a brief in
[SPEAKER_00]: support of the company, were not
immediately available for comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 states and Washington DC allow medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington
state, and Washington DC have legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational sales, though court cases so
far have involved medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado constitution specifically
states that employers don't have to amend
[SPEAKER_00]: their policies to accommodate employees'
marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coats was paralyzed in a car crash as a
teenager and has been a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: patient since 2009 when he discovered that
pot helped calm violent muscle spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a telephone operator with Dish for
three years before he failed a random drug
[SPEAKER_00]: test in 2010 and was fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he told his supervisor in advance
that he would probably fail the drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon Coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the guy's name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Brandon Coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did lose his job, but he tried to stand
up for himself and he took it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: champ, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, shit, at least we know now,
at least it's not an ambiguous law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump in right now and say
something to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on Periscope while I'm recording this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on an application called Periscope
where it's a video app where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: just watching me record and they're
throwing comments and questions at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to tell them, I'm not
watching the comments right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focused on this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need some questions to fill in some
part of the show, I may look to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: for a question or two, but I'm keeping
away from the Periscope chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if it feels like I've been ignoring
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty focused on the podcast over
here and getting this part done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to move on to one more news
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been recording
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got time for one more news
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys for watching on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are watching that, I do appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to be rude and make you
think I'm ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to stay with the show
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this next article,
I found this, I apologize also for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I do fat dabs and I drink
caffeine and then I talk for 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: straight and then the throat just goes to
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big chug of water and
hopefully it'll help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this article comes from The
Cannabis and it is written by,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, it's written by our good friend
Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got my attention because it says,
Oregon police compare piles of weed to a
[SPEAKER_00]: voodoo donut as visual aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, If you're in Oregon and
passionate about marijuana reform,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday is legitimately a mammoth day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting July 1st, adults can possess and
use, grow and share cannabis in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shops won't be open just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes in the fall, officials think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But July 1st will represent to many the
beginning of a new era in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much marijuana will a person be
able to legally possess in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: As our handy Oregon Marijuana Guide says,
anyone over 21 in Oregon can possess up to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight ounces of usable marijuana,
such as dried buds at home and up to one
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce outside of the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially since weed is coming out of
a very dark grow closet in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: an average Portlander might not know how
much cannabis makes up an ounce or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, sorry, this article is written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all squished into one little frame
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to read it right though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps they don't have a laboratory
grade digitally calibrated scale in their
[SPEAKER_00]: desk drawer either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, everyone's got a
digi scale now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it says, Fear not, legal weed
aficionados.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Portland police are here to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very straightforward and almost
sweetly maternal blog, the department
[SPEAKER_00]: encourages community members to be
responsible and considerate with
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell people that stone driving is a
crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public consumption could result in a
citation and bringing Washington bought
[SPEAKER_00]: weed into Oregon is a federal no-no.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that last note being a bit of a
turnaround from the department's previous
[SPEAKER_00]: statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they must've went back on something
they said earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to research that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best part of the Portland police
memo, the visual aid that compares a pile
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed to a voodoo donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the state's most celebrated
edibles, which is not, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most popular snacks in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever go there, you have to have a
voodoo donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends in Portland always talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate you guys that are eating them right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so it says, so how much weed makes
up an ounce?
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal amount you'll be able to have on
your person in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: About the size of a donut, if not a little
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that you guys in Oregon,
you're allowed to have a donut pile sized
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get pulled over by the cops and
you got some weed on you and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much weed you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that cop going to go to his car and
pull out his donut and fucking set the
[SPEAKER_00]: donuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, the cops got a donut in
the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he going to go get a donut and set that
donut down and set it next to your urban?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, eh, I think you're cool,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, what about eight ounces?
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal amount you're able to have at
home in Oregon, about the size of a pile
[SPEAKER_00]: of donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't completely dwarf the donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be able to climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he'd be able to climb that pile of
weed if he could climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have eight donuts worth of weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could have eight ounces,
you'd have about eight donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have a dozen donuts plus two
extra worth of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just visualize that next time you want
to know how much weed you can carry around
[SPEAKER_00]: in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say, it's a genius
ploy on the police's part and the
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusion of donuts inside the official
police marketing material surely isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: lost on anyone checking out the truly
modern graphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes us back, in fact, to when
Denver's police had some 420 friendly fun
[SPEAKER_00]: on their own, when they dropped a smart
hip hop reference on their official
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter account on this last 420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I remember that they said,
we see you rolling and we ain't hating,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they talked about all the rules
that you had to follow to smoke weed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article goes on to say,
Portland and Denver will share more than
[SPEAKER_00]: just legal weed on July 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: In December, 2013, the city's beloved
Voodoo Donuts opened its first shop
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of Oregon and Denver, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time I'm in Denver,
I'm definitely going to go grab myself
[SPEAKER_00]: from some Voodoo Donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's not a line, there's always a
line at that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me read articles from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful, you guys, if you go to
Oregon, make sure to get some donuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you can measure how much cannabis
you can legally possess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have one donut on your person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or eight donuts worth of weed at your
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might start wrapping this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to start closing up the
show, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start closing this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some notes somewhere here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me something that really
stuck to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said a good ganja farmer will never
put something off for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see it needs to be done today,
get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference between growing top
shelf buds and mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never agreed with a statement
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely something that I agree
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, Spencer should be on a show
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a show about improving
your garden pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do, I'm going to try to
find a photographer to come on here and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to us about cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in, if you're local to me and
you're a cannabis photographer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for you to come on the show
and teach my listeners how to take better
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of their ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take pretty decent pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think I am an experienced
enough photographer to come on here and
[SPEAKER_00]: teach everybody how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to talk about ways to
improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that Spencer will be on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll probably be an episode or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about what we're going
to do, trying to schedule that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is heavily scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie invited me over tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie made blueberry muffins that were
freaking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie actually ran a batch of hash for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took some of my nugs and she made me
some beautiful shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you what she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on Periscope,
I'm going to hold this up to the cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maddie did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made some super fire shatter for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of shout outs to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to the
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to
everybody that has started listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found me on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to everybody who is
listening on Periscope and watching on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's super kind of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to come out on
Thursday, so I will be back Monday with
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole fresh episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple more news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some things I want to talk to you
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, big shout out to my ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: See
[SPEAKER_02]: you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smoking all your hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
