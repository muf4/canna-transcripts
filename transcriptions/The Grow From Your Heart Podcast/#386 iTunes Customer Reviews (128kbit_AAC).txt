[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 386 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www

[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog
from our friends at Apothecary Farms in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says it is 64.7% THC and 76.4%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love the Stardog and they did a
great job on this batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, in this episode, we are going to
do iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I'd like to make
one big announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to announce that iReGenetics will
be at the Indo Expo on January 26th and
[SPEAKER_00]: 27th in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Indo Expo is in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the trade show for people who really
know cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at the Oregon Elite Seeds booth
representing Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come find me, grab some iReGenetics,
shake my hand, take a selfie, come say
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at booth 414 and I look forward
to meeting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, podcast world, let's jump right
into these iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to leave a review on the
podcast on iTunes, I would appreciate your
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to the podcast on your
phone, simply open up the podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: scroll like you're looking for new
episodes and it will go right past the old
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will give you ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the top of that is a little
window that says write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you an opportunity to give me
an amount of stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the amount of stars you feel I
truly deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then type in a review and let me know what
you think of the show and I will read your
[SPEAKER_00]: review on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump right into the most recent
iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first iTunes customer review comes
from a listener who calls himself
[SPEAKER_00]: iReArmy619.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the iReArmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen and learn everything you need or
want to know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the main review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is a very knowledgeable and humble
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says follow his guide and grow the
best in your town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said I'm knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me some credibility there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says I'm humble, which makes him
sound like a decent human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he recommends you follow the guide so
that you can grow the best in your town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not have asked for a better
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening and thanks for the
support, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate that five star
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next iTunes customer review comes
from a listener who calls themselves Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: at True North.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we got a five star rating and the
review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way Rasta Jeff combines humor
and information to teach the listener
[SPEAKER_00]: about best grow techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walks the fine line between take this
seriously and don't be afraid to make
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also walks you through the details a
new grower needs to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also conveys a ton of credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust he knows what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have purchased from iReGenetics and
the product is world class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like I may have read that
review before, but that's worth reading
[SPEAKER_00]: again if I did read that on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric at True North.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you notice a little bit of
humor in there while I'm trying to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm glad that you're learning from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before, but I was not a good
student in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to learn, but I did not like
being at school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to educate in a way that I think
can keep people's attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to put some jokes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it entertaining and funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say I walked that fine line
between take this seriously and don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing brain surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing rocket science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to make a few mistakes
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't learn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things go smoothly every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do some experiments and challenge
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how you learn the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you also say that I walk you through
the details that a new grower needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I want to get everybody up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that not everybody has experience
in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grab everybody by the hand and
walk them right through a grow and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you mentioned is that,
you know, I have got credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you trust, you know, you trust
that I know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you also say you have purchased from
irie genetics and the product is world
[SPEAKER_00]: class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm glad that the irie genetic seeds
worked for you and I'm glad that you found
[SPEAKER_00]: it world class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last words were keep it up,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you know, I will can't stop won't
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, true north, thank you for the
great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, keep listening to the podcast and
I will keep teaching you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next review comes from a person who
calls themselves Mountain Man Drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Man Drew left us a five star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five star review and the review goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff keeps it cool and classy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could come hang out in the
studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, some of my favorite episodes
feature Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems like a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mountain Man Drew, thanks for the five
star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for saying that this is one of your
favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious what your other podcast,
what your other favorites are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you think I keep it cool and
classy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be cool and classy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you can come hang out if you're not
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a creep, if you're not a
psycho and if you don't smell like a pile
[SPEAKER_00]: of dog shit, you can come hang out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come kick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my dining room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as fancy as you think it's going
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, bro, you're invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the review goes on to say,
by the way, some of my favorite episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: feature Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, dude, thank you for saying that
because in a recent review, we had
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody bashing on Mike and saying they
did not enjoy Mike on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention that that review no
longer exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scroll through my iTunes customer
ratings and reviews, that review from Yolo
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower where he bashed Mike, it is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was taken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back to nothing but positivity in
the ratings and reviews section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, Mike, I hope you heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this guy's favorite episodes
feature Mike and he says, you seem like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mountain Man Drew, thanks for shouting
out the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for shouting out Mike and thank you
for listening and thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep moving on with these
customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one comes from a person who
calls themselves smoke and art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke and art left us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of their review is great show
and the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a must for any new or old grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to every show at least once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much good info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, smoke and art, it sounds like I am
hitting my target audience with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the shows multiple
times and you're finding a lot of info and
[SPEAKER_00]: you are finding it educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfect, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening and thanks for saying
it's a must for new and old growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels good knowing I'm hitting my
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, our next review comes from a
person who called themselves Ridge Monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is GFYH equals dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left a five star rating and the
review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a desire to learn about
cannabis in more aspects than simply
[SPEAKER_00]: learning to grow, then this is a good
podcast to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although Rasta Jeff does focus most of the
podcast time on the cultivation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, it still has a has savory nugs
of the culture in general on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is very thorough and has made me a
believer in his capabilities to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent quality, knowledge and
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: His arise is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike occasionally comes on the show with
some great information regarding the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and also how to fight for your
rights in the city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect and much love to White Mike
and Rasta Jeff for his amazing podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of that, Ridge Monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do focus mostly on growing because I am
a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of grow experience and I
feel that that was what was lacking in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis podcast area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed somebody to talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of market reviews and
politics stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't somebody out there talking
about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to fill that niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of growing experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of teaching experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I would be a great person for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do focus mostly on the cultivation
part, but I'm glad you find that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets of our culture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also am glad that you appreciate
Mike being on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that you said that my arise
is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also appreciate that you said I have
made you a believer in my capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that support and thanks for
shouting out Mike and for my and shutting
[SPEAKER_00]: out myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for all of the love and
respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for saying the podcast is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Ridge Monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review and thanks for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there are more reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is genuine and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we got a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review says Rasta Jeff is both honest
and knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't push sponsors and doesn't hate
on others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be let down by an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every show has a genuine tone and you can
feel the care and time that has gone into
[SPEAKER_00]: each production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five stars is a perfect rating for this
podcast in this genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn something new every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I said your name because I
think it's Talluna12 is how you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the great review Talluna12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You called me honest and knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't push sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a product that I really
supported that wanted to sponsor the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no need to have sponsors on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just all for you guys to learn,
not for me to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hate on others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's no need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to get either one of us
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be let down by an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say that you can feel the
care and time that goes into each
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thank you because I do put a lot of
energy and time into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad somebody notices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for mentioning that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then five stars because you learn
something every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you were learning something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for learning with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for becoming a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for the great rating and
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is headlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re army for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is left by Ivyzilla and the
review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs to me that I have heard every
episode at least once, but I don't think I
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever left a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five stars all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stumbled upon Rasta Jeff through an
internet search for local suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a weird way to find a cannabis
podcast creator, but that's how it worked
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how that worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have some friends who were in
the suicide girls group and we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: little thing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a photo shoot and some cannabis
things happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand how that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes on to say I also enjoy
listening to Jeff and his friends as they
[SPEAKER_00]: get lifted and talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently moved my family from Colorado
to a state that is in the early days of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially love the episodes that talk
about standing up for the creation of new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis laws in your immediate area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel strongly that the entire country
needs to have avenues for responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: adults to acquire cannabis legally and
safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting a new year and while the
political climate is unpleasant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely time for the ivory army to
stand up and be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safe cannabis for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the inspiration and happy
new year from our friend Tied Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Tied Up, thanks for the great review,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some fun together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been around for quite a while,
so you are absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely time for you to leave a
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for all of the
appreciation toward Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to hear so much support for
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you like listening to Mike and my
friends and I hang out and get lifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, thank you for all of the ivory
army support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to have you as part of the
ivory army.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bro, the next time you're in Colorado,
let's get together and let's get elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we've got more customer reviews
to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one comes from a person who calls
themselves Ogres Organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is great edutainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left us a five star review and the
rating goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a great range of topics and covers
each subject really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having Mike on as he has helped me
get ready for when my state finally goes
[SPEAKER_00]: legal to start growing my own happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Ogres, thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love having you as a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate the range of
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I love hearing all of the
support for Mike on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks and big shout out for the
great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we've only got two more,
so let's get right through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, the headline says surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said no Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple episodes back, I said I probably
would not put out a Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike ended up coming over and getting high
and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did put out a Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome for the bonus content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also a huge shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, thank you for coming out and
doing a long episode that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're invited back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do more shows like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the listeners really enjoyed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue with this episode
or with this review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I liked all the info about how to
behave when driving dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I missed all but the last 15 minutes
of your live show last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great to put a face to the all
knowing voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all you do in the cannabis
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really welcome for all of what I do
for the cannabis cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a great listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five star rating and
thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person mentioned he missed all of but
the last 15 minutes of my live show last
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is referring to my Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on Instagram live and I do hour long
rants where I just take a few dabs and I
[SPEAKER_00]: answer cannabis questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's really serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gets really goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what he's talking about in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hanging out in the Instagram
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys let's move into the last iTunes
