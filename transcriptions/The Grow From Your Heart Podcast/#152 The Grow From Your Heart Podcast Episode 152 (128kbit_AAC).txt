[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 152 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a news smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends, Call Me Ross or
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
we're going to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: revegging and reverting your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to take their plants all
the way through the flowering phase and
[SPEAKER_00]: then return them back to veg and reuse
those same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will talk a little bit about that
later in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get that far, I want to talk
about some cool shit that I got to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of teased this on a past episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take a good friend up to Colorado
Springs on Thursday and we saw Jeff Tate,
[SPEAKER_00]: Emma Arnold, and some other opening
comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Ben Verbeck was an opening
comedian up at the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did their Good Cop, Bad Cop comedy
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with Jeff Tate and Emma
Arnold and they treated me like a rock
[SPEAKER_00]: star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Jeff Tate several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my first time meeting Emma Arnold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Jeff Tate several times with
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So him and I have become comfortable with
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has recently become a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has made the switch from alcohol to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emma Arnold do some comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Verbeck opened the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy whose name has left my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew his name until right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy went on second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Emma Arnold went on and her set
was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Jeff Tate went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a comedy set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then toward the end of his standup
routine, he said, I'm going to light this
[SPEAKER_00]: joint and start smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point in this comedy show,
I'm going to become too high to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: doing standup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he lit his joint and he kept doing
his bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point he obviously got
too high and he said thanks and walked off
[SPEAKER_00]: the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday, I took the night off, got some
rest, hung out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday and Sunday, we went to Denver and
I saw my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite band is Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Fish at the Dick's Sporting Goods
Arena, stadium, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: a gigantic, big ass soccer field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw Fish there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three nights were sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he did not have tickets, it was a
challenge getting tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky I got into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, Fish was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Played some of my favorite songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played a really amazing version of a
song called Maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played Tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Played some great, great music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safe drive, which was great because it was
a busy holiday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday morning, we head back up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get some food up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to see Doug Benson at the
Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite podcasts is the Doug
Loves Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joined once again by his friends,
Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a guy named Trey Galleon joined
them for the Doug Loves Movies taping at
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I got to hang out for that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Baker for
getting me front row all the time at
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great taping, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest that you listen to the Denver
show of Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this podcast comes out,
that will be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this podcast,
you have access to Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see the live taping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the podcast taping,
we're all hanging outside in the alley
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking because Doug and his friends love
to come and just smoke out with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made friends with Trey Galleon almost
instantly, like instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy and I are homies now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be friends for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I left, all four of the comedians
were standing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hey, you guys, it means a lot
to me that you come and do comedy because
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy is super important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all like sincerely felt my
thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of cool to see all four
of their faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, holy shit, we made this dude's day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my weekend, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of good comedy, a whole
bunch of good music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Ben Verbeck from the Dab
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Dab Lounge in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge shout outs to Emma Arnold,
Jeff Tate, Trey Galleon, Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to Fish and my fishing
buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a grow update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a grow update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that's been listening to the
show knows that I've been working on a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one light with a very small
breeding project happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I went in there and pulled
out the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected a little bit of pollen from
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I cut the plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I hosed myself down with a
good shower because I don't want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the male plant is out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant has dropped his pollen and he
is now gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five Arise female types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are number four, number five,
number seven, number eight, and then one
[SPEAKER_00]: that was labeled E.
[SPEAKER_00]: E was the remaining phenotype from another
phenohunt that I liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: E has been around for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: E is the Arise that you see a lot of
pictures of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones are really good competitors
that have great traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got those five female phenotypes
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one Golden Goat, one Grateful Dog,
one Lemon Skunk, all of those are females
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are eight females that have all
been pollinated by this one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're currently 40 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about 25 days since pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got probably 20 to 30 days
before I can harvest these plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently the seeds are visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the pollen worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants took the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeded now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're developing nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other day I grabbed a bottom bud
and just pinched one of the seeds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're white still, but they are starting
to develop an embryo inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shells are getting a little bit hard,
but they are still white.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste weird also if you're curious,
but they're not quite ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got a little ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're ready, my plan is to let
them go until those seeds are really well
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to cut down each plant
and label each plant very carefully as to
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will hang each plant in its own
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a bowl underneath it so that if a
seed does fall out, I'll catch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you guys, I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use a drum head, flip the
drum head upside down, put it underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant so that if a seed falls out,
it lands in the drum head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they dry, I will take each plant
individually and crush it up into probably
[SPEAKER_00]: a Tupperware dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like I'll take off the fan leaves
and I'll crunch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the buds will get just like hand
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to roll joints and then
I'll just, all the seeds will fall out at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull out all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jar them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As to which phenotype that is,
like Arise F2, like it'll be Arise 5,
[SPEAKER_00]: F2, Arise 7, F2, whatever plant it comes
from, I'll make sure it's labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to grow a bunch of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my friends are going to grow a
bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to see which Arise
phenotypes I want to continue breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll see if this golden goat,
the grateful dog and lemon skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see if they do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stabilize this Arise a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is actually in the long run to
take this Arise all the way to F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take me a couple of years,
probably two more years, maybe three more
[SPEAKER_00]: years to get it there, depending on how
selection goes, depending on how stubborn
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, depending on what the F2s and F3s
show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my breeding update, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys sticking around for
the breeding updates with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions on my breeding
project, please send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to answer your questions
about my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some listener emails and
this will segue me into the reverting and
[SPEAKER_00]: reveging topic that I teased about at the
top of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of great messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came on Instagram and this was
actually, this guy had no idea that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use this as podcast content.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a personal conversation between
him and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to call this the
seeded herb question, email number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy says, quick question,
I pulled off almost all the fan leaves on
[SPEAKER_00]: an early flowering strawberry cough plant
from Sagamarta seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at five to six weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the strawberry cough plant threw
bananas before I saw them because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in all the plants fully mature now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only plant that had bananas was
the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he says he saw bananas,
he means that he saw male flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: developing on his female plants,
which means that this female was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it was stressed and it caused it to
panic and cause male flowers so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could try to keep itself alive by making
more seeds and then continuing its
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he continues with another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, will these banana pollen seeds
make mostly plants that have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: toss bananas easily or at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the thing is the main thing here,
we don't know why that strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_00]: plant threw those bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why it hermaphrodited out on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's got herm traits in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's one of its parents
was a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if that specific phenotype
is a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why that plant threw
bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that would have caused it to throw
bananas would have been a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things I've seen, light comes in
through your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you're ducting those hooded
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got ducting running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running it out the window or
wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light comes reflecting into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant that is right underneath
that reflector, I've seen those
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite because they are getting hit
with light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that could cause that plant
to hermaphrodite could be heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing could be over-nutrienting
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much nitrogen toward the end of flower
could absolutely cause a plant to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too dry, too moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of weird interruption on some
strains can cause them to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now the main question is did that
plant herm because it's a hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: itself or was it an environmental factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it's herming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna hermaphrodite on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I would keep in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go ahead and get rid of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the seeds that come out
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have something else to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that every plant that is now
mature has seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me think that you could have a
light leak in there and all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants all produce seeds because of light
stress and only that strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_00]: showed the hermaphrodite flowers just
because that's a phenotypical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones may not have shown you the
hermaphrodite flowers, but they could have
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded on their own just from being
stressed, even if you didn't see flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that strawberry cough is the
only one that you actually noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers, maybe it produced them to
where you could see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all could have been seeded by that
rogue hermaphrodite strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that strawberry cough was a
hermaphrodite, you may have created some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may grow some great phenotypes,
but you may also run into a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing could be true if you got
your seeds from stressing those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: from light stress or from overfeeding or
from underfeeding or for overwatering,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever caused that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have produced some amazing
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also may have produced a bunch of
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main piece of advice is don't share
those seeds with anybody until you've ran
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do give them out,
make sure people know that they do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency or at least a likelihood to have
some hermaphrodite traits in there because
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want people wasting their time
growing herms when they could be growing
[SPEAKER_00]: quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy that sent me this message,
you have produced some quality stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's just stick to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my throat's burning out for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously need a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was taking a drink and a couple of
dabs, something dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our listener in his message said that his
plant was an early flowering strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cough plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that phrase early flowering indicates
a couple of things to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that plant flowered more
quickly than the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, did it show flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like day 10 when the other plants waited
till day 14 or 15?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did it flower on its own while it was
in under veg lights under 18 or 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you mean by early
flowering, but that says something to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant that wants to auto flower like
that is probably a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it's trying to flower early is
because a male plant wants to get up above
[SPEAKER_00]: the female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows a little taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to get up above the female plants
and it wants to start dropping pollen so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's already spitting out pollen by
the time those female plants are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plant's whole goal in life is
to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant is probably a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to get taller than everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to flower first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to have pollen falling before all
of those females are ready so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over there at the party set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already got a beer in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just waiting for the chicks to show
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not use that plant for growing
or breeding anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that you made are probably
produced from a hermaphrodite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see some hermaphroditic
tendencies in that progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't give those out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow those myself and pay very
close attention to what happens to those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever have any more questions,
send them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use more of your stuff on the
podcast because you have some great
[SPEAKER_00]: questions because you're an advanced
grower and I like where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say your name on the show,
but you know who I'm talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings us to our next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes ago, I was sent an email
about monster cropping and I told the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wasn't sure what he meant about
monster cropping because when I Googled
[SPEAKER_00]: it, there were a ton of different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked him for more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has replied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Hey bro, when I was asking about
monster cropping, I was meaning when you
[SPEAKER_00]: take a cut off a female plant,
that's about three weeks in bloom and
[SPEAKER_00]: re-veg her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy telling me about this last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that the clone goes crazy making
shoots and there's no need to top her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming you were re-vegging the
clone that you're taking and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: letting that plant flower and finish out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a decent idea if you're
taking that clone from near the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, if you're not taking it off of
the top because you don't want to disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of seems like it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of also seems like it could be a
waste of time and the amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a plant that's three weeks into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already starting to show little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones have converted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to make buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need to take that clone and get it
in the cloner or in the dome, however you
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be under 24 hours of light and
you have to revert that plant all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: back to a vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to veg it to the size that
you need it and then you can flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it takes a long time and
honestly I wouldn't even flower out that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take clones once it started
getting healthy and re-vegging and
[SPEAKER_00]: spitting out proper shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take clones of that and turn those
clones into a mother plant and then start
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of seems like a lot of work for
just a plant with some extra shoots to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the amount of time that you're
re-vegging to develop those shoots to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-veg it to get it healthy, I could
probably just cut another clone and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: happy plant by topping and shaping and
pruning and making the plant the size and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape I wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like kind of a waste of time in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to knock anybody's method
because they may have a purpose for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be working for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I bet you in the amount of time you're
spending re-vegging, I could probably just
[SPEAKER_00]: cut clones and do things the simple way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top it, train it, get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you told me what monster cropping
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has tried
monster cropping, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know more info about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how it goes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking about re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did kind of bash it and say that it's
sort of a waste of time, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: times when re-vegging is a very useful
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are reasons to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you forgot to take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about when you grow from
seed, make sure you take clones because
[SPEAKER_00]: you may grow the best shoot you've ever
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have a clone,
you're going to be angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you didn't take a clone of that
plant, re-vegging is always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you did take a shit ton of clones
and maybe you fucked up and maybe all your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you don't have any clones of that
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has happened to me before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're even more like me and my
friend Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you grow too many seeds and you
don't even have any room left to take more
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your only option is to revert those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about
re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-vegging is actually when you have
flowered out a cannabis plant and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to return it back to its vegetative state
so you can start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said before, I would return
that plant back to a veg state and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: take clones from it and then use those
clones as my new mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't try to flower that one back
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels to me like you would just kind of
wear that plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it, but it's going to stress
that plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to get weaker as it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't guarantee that, but I wouldn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take, I would re-veg it and then
try to take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like your second chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully your clones live this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't kill them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you remember to take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to re-veg your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really speed up your re-vegging
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sounds crazy, but this will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you begin to flush approximately 10
to 14 days before harvest time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully recommend that you turn your
lights back on to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more 12.12.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them on for 18 hours and off for
six hours a day for the last 10 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: of your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you're flushing, change the timer
back to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That two week period isn't enough time to
revert those plants back to veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: since they are so far along in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may see some of the buds start to
try to revert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harvest time anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cutting those plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 10 to 14 days before harvest
time, put your timer back on to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your veg schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it back on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get the plant sped up back into
the re-veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut your plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're harvesting, leave the bottom
three buds on the bottom branches of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a single stock plant,
if you did not top, if you've got a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with one stock coming up, there's a little
intersection where it makes a peace sign,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the main stock going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a branch coming off the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a branch coming off the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up the left branch and up the right
branch, there will be little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave the bottom three buds on
those bottom branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the bottom of the plant up,
find the bottom ones and then go one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave those three buds and harvest
everything else on the bottom two
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you topped it, you've got four
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on those bottom four, leave the bottom
three buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going to revert into a
vegetative plant and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've harvested the plant,
move it to a room with 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either use a T5, you can use a
metal halide, or you can use an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more light you use, the more quickly
your plant will return back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage and you can start taking
clones from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use one of those clones as a new
mother plant, veg that one out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: take clones from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those clones can be your next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you have now solved the
problem of a flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fixed the hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten it back to the way it should
be as a vegetative plant and you're right
[SPEAKER_00]: back where you began.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is while you're
waiting for your plant to revert,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should feed it with kelp and
vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use your basic veg newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: More nitrogen will help speed up the
process, but don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to speed up the process,
there is one thing that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add 200 particles per million of
GA3, that's gibberellic acid, to your feed
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will really speed up the reverting
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this will do, now earlier I talked
about taking that flowering plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: reverting it back to veg and then taking a
clone from that and using that clone as
[SPEAKER_00]: your new mother and then cutting clones
from that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the gibberellic acid,
I feel like you can take that plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was flowering and you can revert it and
then take clones from it and those clones
[SPEAKER_00]: will be completely fine to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep one of those as your mother plant,
flower out the rest of them and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: back on track with vegetative plants and a
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not lose your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can grow that strain forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you take clones from here on
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you do reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I hope you learned a lot from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
