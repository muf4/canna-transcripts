[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, ten, a big disaster in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bombs are going off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We whip the batter till it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my butter on another matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the tip of the dabbing tends to chip
the shatter in my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikes, I'm set to scorch, but get the
dormant well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm a vector torch and the
microphone's a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the truth, all you liars go to hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I grab the mic, it's like a
giant show and tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've been doing this since way
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get A's until I blazed them,
my great slack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to college and acknowledged that I
hated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make
it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the way you act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's fishy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I smell a rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our house, but we ain't got to
tell them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's leave them at the front door yelling
at the welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on everybody, get another dab pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same routine, slightly different from the
last track.
[SPEAKER_00]: A million songs about we, but where the
dab's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like my dabbing songs,
you can kiss my ass crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on everybody, drop another huge bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 games, 710, it's time to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upgrade your tolerance, downside your new
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite way to medicate, I don't think
it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my fans, I'ma make them bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my checks from my bank account.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to TaskRock for letting me
play some music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to TaskRock, TNL,
Linus.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Task and Linus, TNL, The Movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm a little distracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting here trying to open this
edible that I bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to eat a Mountain Medicine 350
milligram active cannabis delightful
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate peanut butter bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain Medicine, get your goat on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new rules say that these packages have
to be child-proof and goddamn.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the microphone with me is my buddy,
Adam Gaskins.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna do just kind of a fun episode
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing super planned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say what's up, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sitting here watching him struggle
with this packaging and he's bid at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's starting to grab instruments and
trying to cut it open.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a pair of scissors, probably 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there scissors over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right over there behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That reminds me part of our talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may talk if I even get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna eat this edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to episode number 22 of the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're joining us on another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do sponsors in just a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Adam for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my friend that helped me
trim tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening to the podcast,
short person with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You helped out a lot, saved me a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just dropped a bunch of weed into
this edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just picked up scissors that we were
using to trim to open this package.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're package compliant, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: This company, there's an expiration date
on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a barcode on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a made on date.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then inside, yeah, inside of here,
this is like bulletproof, Kevlar,
[SPEAKER_02]: fireproof, bombproof plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took Fiskars scissors to get through
this shit and they struggled a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiskars are your lawn scissors,
just to let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Fiskars are the fucking diamond tip
trim scissors, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna do, read an ad for a sponsor
while I struggle to get this open right
[SPEAKER_02]: quick.

for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is also brought to you by
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit the Denver store at 8271 Beach
Street, Unit F, or stop by the new Pueblo
[SPEAKER_02]: location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection on indoor growing
[SPEAKER_02]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check out www.hygrodenver
.com, hygrodenver.com for current store
[SPEAKER_02]: hours and special sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're running a special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the paper in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is $550 for one tote of supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tote of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about this last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tote of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's if you pick it up at the store,
it's $550.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes in one bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's roots organic soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is a tote?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is approximately, in my measurements,
I think that is about 28 or up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 48 to 50 seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can run an eight light setup pretty
decently with this one package of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need it delivered, it is $600.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes on a FedEx truck to your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like the Hydro shop has shown
up with a truck or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually FedEx.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you got a package that's
fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully they can haul it right into
your garden area or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have to deal with
moving that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check out our good friends at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to Jesse
and Bernadette.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got married this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bern actually works at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what made me think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got married.
[SPEAKER_02]: They threw an awesome party.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to give them a quick shout out
of congratulations at the start of the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk a little more about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a few minutes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you got something to say,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just going to say
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, their wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oil Slick is next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil Slick's a loyal sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been a long time sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use an Oil Slick product every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's almost one in every room of my
house, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most used products in this
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carb caps, dabbers, Oil Slick pads,
and a rig and a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a torch sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vector torches, come hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if somebody's got another email for me
because this one's starting to lose its
[SPEAKER_02]: luster.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email company wants to sponsor us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's review your product and shit and
we'll shout you out on the show all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough pandering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our friends at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tools to help you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out oilslickpad.com for more
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, go find our friends Oil Slick on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I say that every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But go find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're at Oil Slick pad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send them a tweet and let them know that
you're listening to the Hygro Culture
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know you heard this ad and that
my advertiser advertising is effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know that you're paying attention
and that it's working for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know right now you're probably in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be driving in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're on a treadmill.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do when you're listening to
the podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually game.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're playing video games?
[SPEAKER_02]: A slow game.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you don't have your hands
available to go and tweet me something,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to remember it later, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tweet us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I ask for a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's all I want is a simple tweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Oil Slick just, I mean, dude,
they're constantly coming up with good
[SPEAKER_03]: glitter pictures just alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm following them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're dabbing, the reason I have
them as a sponsor is because I use their
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff because it's necessity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're dabbing, you need some Oil Slick
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need something to keep your hash in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smoking the live resin that
we've got now, you don't want to carry it
[SPEAKER_02]: around in parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your live resin to be kept in a
nice, smooth-looking Oil Slick container.
[SPEAKER_02]: My red, gold, and green Rasta-colored Oil
Slick container on the table with my Oil
[SPEAKER_02]: Slick pads.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got these things here with the
magnetic sides, too, where you can just
[SPEAKER_03]: put your slab in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to fucking Google that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that's actually their
product or if somebody's making that
[SPEAKER_02]: modified version because I can't find it
on their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Oil Slick, if you're listening,
no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to find out because
that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a miniature-sized slab,
you can take two of these Oil Slick mini
[SPEAKER_02]: pads, slick pad minis, and you can rubber
band them together with your slab in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can find other ways to stick them
together and just have your slab right in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle and make it easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually use it almost as a,
I wipe my dabber off on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's all sticky on this edge
near me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take another dab, wipe it off on
there, and my next dab doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: residue of my last dab on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every dab is fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, but I've seen you use
them to set pipes down on just for... I
[SPEAKER_02]: usually try to have it like a coaster
because the table's wood, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just a little better than fucking dropping
my glass onto the table, have that little
[SPEAKER_02]: pad underneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all the glass is heavy and thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and my domes for my dome rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's one dome rig on the table
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dome sits on there because you
leave... I made an ad that said,
[SPEAKER_02]: stop leaving sticky rings on your mom's
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody's table's got those
little rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell who's a dabber and who tries
to hide it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a huge shout out to our friends
at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, Oil Slick's been a huge sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally represent that shit all day
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sponsoring us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, go to their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say it already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it written?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oilslickpad.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have to give one more ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to treethugger.com.

[SPEAKER_02]: www.treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was like, treehugger,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, treethugger, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got seven Facebook messages in a
row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the internet's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think your phone was not working earlier
because the internet was down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what the problem was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the internet is back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, we might be able to read some news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the internet's back, I wasn't able
to research much news because the internet
[SPEAKER_02]: was crooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got the ads out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect to all those sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to give a big shout out to our
friends at Natural Mystic, Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Caregivers, and Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelly, you're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big digital hug to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you get to listen to the
show, but either way, I'm sending you out
[SPEAKER_02]: a big, digital, thoughtful hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Joey, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I should say that on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't give me a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, thanks for that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really needed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps me out in a big, big way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge shout out to Natural Mystic,
Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all the ads I'm responsible
for this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this thing open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's eat an edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we all started 10 minutes
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 6 ounces, 168 grams of chocolate
and peanut butter is what it looks like to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: 350 milligrams active cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicinal product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep out of reach of children.
[SPEAKER_02]: The packaging is quite fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read you the back just
because this is a really, they did a hell
[SPEAKER_02]: of a good job on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the outer box.
[SPEAKER_02]: This product is infused with medical
marijuana and was provided without
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory oversight for health,
safety, or efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may be health risks associated
with the consumption of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep out of the reach of children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Processed in a facility that may contain
nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's peanut butter in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be additional health risks
associated with the consumption of this
[SPEAKER_02]: product for women who are pregnant,
breastfeeding, or planning on becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: pregnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much anyone in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: This product is unlawful outside the state
of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: The intoxicating effects of this product
may be delayed by two or more hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not drive a motor vehicle or operate
heavy machinery while using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a phone number and an OPC license
like it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ingredients caught my attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eggs, flour, baking soda, salt,
cocoa powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading all the whole fucking wrapper
I know, but I've got a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peanut butter, butter, powdered sugar,
chocolate, hash butter, 0.5 grams,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis weight, 0.5 grams dosage,
50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is supposed to be a seven dose
edible here is what they have intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to eat the whole damn thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I have planned right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a napkin, I got a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is going to go down well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's got my attention is it lists other
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has P, 51.9%, K, 38.1%, and 11 point,
sorry, I should back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did them in the wrong order,
but that's, you know what I mean now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the nutrients used in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium, magnesium, sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that one means.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should, but I don't know the table of
elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can't do it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: The periodic table of elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading these, sugar, malt extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they list also what it was grown with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the bottom here, organic neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they also list some of the stuff that
was used to treat the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty interesting that they list
that on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know almost everything that went into
this product that I'm going to eat,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of nice to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get down to the fucking point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put this edible in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn up some task rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to hear me chewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bit it open, and as soon as my mouth,
my teeth broke the seal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled like old school pot food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really smells like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a smell-proof, vacuum-sealed
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tear this wrapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to open it up a little more to
slide this out easily, and it fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: won't rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make parachutes out of this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouse material.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm almost to the first bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 350?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can taste all 350.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chocolatey and peanut buttery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it almost like an ice cream type of
bar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it have a softer texture?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top layer is straight creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peanut butter, the bottom layer is soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like almost a soggy brownie,
but better.
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that texture is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost a fudge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a nougat?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's harder than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give you some, but I want to eat
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You eat it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to fucking experience this 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, I think they have these down
here at the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of shops, it's a peanut
butter bar, so whatever they make a
peanut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature's Mystic is, dude, public is a step
of their game up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, their bud down there,
I feel like driving to Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we went to Natural Mystic Cannabis
Caregivers to pick up some shatter because
[SPEAKER_02]: we were low on shatter, and we were just
waiting for things to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam doesn't get to go to a lot of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took Adam with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been shopping at Pueblo shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers blew
your mind, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their bud quality, they were big,
hard nuggets of joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like they love those plants
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, oh, let's see how quickly we
can turn this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: For number one, I think it was still only
medical, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that shop is only medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the, you know,
one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, there's still medical
shops that don't give a damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a lot of chocolate and peanut
butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like, if you're actually sick
and have like cancer or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that this, I'm not knocking
the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get acne from chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this would break out in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like while you're eating it, you get zits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bag of M&M's the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's supposed to be seven doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's supposed to be seven doses,
I'm a good four doses in by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see, that last drink that I bought,
that's what I thought too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was like, I was like,
I marked lines on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, goop, goop, goop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was down to here and I was
like, oh, well, you know, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're talking about the chai high?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a chai high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have been that chai high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that what it was called?
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed me the bottle in a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so worthless to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our little trimmer friend that was here
earlier, who used to work at a shop,
[SPEAKER_02]: she said she used to drink those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it would wreck her and
sometimes it wouldn't do anything to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may have been, that's what she was
saying, the lady at the shop, she said,
[SPEAKER_02]: next time try a fruit flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like an apple cider type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, that's me,
dude, all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Southern boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went, all they had was some
cappuccino.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, it was like watered down
you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he said watered down you,
who did anybody else think of the Beastie
[SPEAKER_02]: Boys song?
[SPEAKER_02]: Professor Booty is a song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody else knows what I'm talking
about, tweet me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tweet me a hashtag Professor Booty at
I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you an irie genetic sticker or
two.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm begging for attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of, remember the little
Debbie Nutty bars?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like, or a peanut butter bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy those for the kids, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, remember those?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had those last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hippie made this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hippie made this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of those snacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to buy another brand
because they're delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reluctant to say the brand I was
opting to buy that I chose this over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going, I asked for a monkey bar
because the monkey bars, I love a monkey
[SPEAKER_02]: bar, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love from Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The monkey bar is delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the girl that works at, the lady that
works at the dispensary is a friend of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine and also a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a cancer survivor and she uses these
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, I know you like the
Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're $10.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Mountain Medicine peanut butter bar
is $11.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like three and a half of those for
a dollar more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the businessman in me
didn't take a lot of convincing to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's three for one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just handed her money and thanked
her for being such a great person.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor so far, I am happy with my
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I'm going to be wrecked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we better get anything out of the way
that we need to handle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you want to eat all of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to eat all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying because you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: High five and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if it got melted and all 350
brand of this bite and all 350 brand of
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're saying, there's a, it's almost
like a different kind of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would almost kind of imagine that it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how right there, there's like a
big splatch of like, that's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate chip or something inside of some
peanut butter batter stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the works, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a layer of semi-dark chocolate over
peanut butter with this peanut butter
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thick mousse, a light fudge sort of
a texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, I can eat it quickly and it does,
it's not so peanut buttery that I'm stuck
[SPEAKER_02]: while I'm trying to talk, but it does take
a little effort to clean up the face while
[SPEAKER_02]: you're grubbing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the summertime, eat this in the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to take this out anywhere
because she told you to kind of put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fridge for five or 10 minutes
beforehand, or she said actually put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the microwave or warm it up first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, she did.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this would have been a, I don't know
that I'd recommend that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would just be a puddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't say long.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said like one second, two seconds,
you know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna take a couple more bites out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe just putting it in the
refrigerator would be even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a strain at natural mystic
cannabis caregivers that got your
[SPEAKER_02]: attention?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they had some great looking herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smelled a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was only one of them that I really
knew what the smell was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that was my only comparison.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had harlequin there that was,
I haven't smelled that yet and it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, it was really potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the, what was the other one that
we got or that you got that day that they
[SPEAKER_03]: had the strain there?
[SPEAKER_03]: The torobora?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, not the torobora.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the super lemon haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember which one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had one that just stunk to high hell
and it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the one I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one where it's, that's what we got
some of the shatter was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the guava.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the guava.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really impressed me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that, she opened the jar and it was
like a punch in the face before she handed
[SPEAKER_03]: it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, like I said, there was no
small nugs in the jar and everything was
[SPEAKER_03]: frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was right to that point where I
feel like I could have brought it home and
[SPEAKER_03]: kept it in my jar for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would have been like, you know,
I could have judged where, how dry or how
[SPEAKER_02]: wet I wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam tends to like his weed a little
crispier than most folk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam likes it a little drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like, so we'll cure it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then give it to Adam to destroy for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still it's, it's nice to have that
option instead of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you get something wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all in now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put the rest of this thing in my
mouth up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't about that final thing filled
with butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that last bite tastes like butter,
not even like chocolate or pot of butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paula Dean made that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've never had a chance to say this on
like a public platform, but fuck Paula
[SPEAKER_02]: Dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, here, here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, fuck her before her racism,
but extra fucking for her racism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get this chocolate peanut
butter mix in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had an Italian girlfriend and we
would watch Giada De Laurentiis and Paula
[SPEAKER_02]: Dean back to back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Alton Brown was on in the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wiping my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got fucking chocolate, peanut butter,
butter all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate, peanut butter, butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could feel the butter on my lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, it tastes like movie theater
popcorn on that last bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paula Dean one day, she's making a meal
and she's like, this meal got a little sum
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, except the vegetarians, but screw
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can go outside and eat grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Paula Dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go outside and eat grass
while your show's on and never watch your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking show again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go outside eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not going to go down that road in
your podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go outside and smoke grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never really done a fuck you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel almost a little bad now,
but fuck you Paula Dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're racist and you're fucking rude to
vegetarians.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do, I sent her a letter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I will go outside and eat
grass until Giada De Laurentiis comes back
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you have a correction or something
that you needed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get to the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can drive the podcast today,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I wasn't trying to drive the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're totally right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate an edible and you're going to have
to keep me on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we've been smoking live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Unicorn Hash and Butt Naked,
also known as Bear Naked, depends on where
[SPEAKER_02]: you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know about the Unicorn Hash,
the live resin or the Butt Naked,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't even know, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That love resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The love resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard all that shit here first on the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to ask questions later.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: A correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did an episode about veg growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point in the episode, I said,
keep your veg plants on 1212.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said something wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was me being a man and telling you,
I fucking said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm correcting myself right now on the air
where I have the chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the captain of this ship and I almost
drove it into the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, now I feel kind of like an
asshole because I forgot it was about
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was something else because I
thought you corrected about that last week
[SPEAKER_03]: or the last podcast episode you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was correcting my... Now you're
pointing out that I fucked up twice,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just edit this shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm leaving this in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I said I'm being a man about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just be like, no, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just keep talking like that didn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we got to correct it because I am the
captain of this fucking pirate ship right
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my ship that I'm driving and I got
to guide you guys into the right way or
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all going to fail together and I
want you to win is why I'm doing a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to improve your growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to adjust the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Task got a little loud for me,
but I want to make your growing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, my first mistake was I don't even
know if I said it on the podcast or in a
[SPEAKER_02]: personal conversation, but I mentioned the
red light spectrum and I got it totally
[SPEAKER_02]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my second mistake was saying to
keep your vegging plants on 1212.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your vegging plants on at least 18
hours of light, at least 16 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 would be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 is what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be perfectly fair, you didn't say it
like, by the way, put your plants... No,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was at the end of your sentence,
at the end of your lesson, at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: your ramble of how lights work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would definitely back from... I've
probably been doing a show for an hour or
[SPEAKER_02]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, but I admit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucked up and I'm driving this boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just telling you from a listener's
point of view, tighten your shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be buying more of these edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so good, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this chocolate peanut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate peanut butter is a pothead's
treat in my mind and I've got it in my
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth and it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a peanut butter fudge dude from Sonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This song that's popping up right now is
called Hashtag and You Can't Get Enough
[SPEAKER_02]: Though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect because chocolate peanut butter
and you can't get enough though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like I said, I would have
definitely been like, yo, 11 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did a correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate the edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should talk about Jesse's wedding
reception.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a big shout out to Jesse
and Bern, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Witt, I got to meet Jesse's father.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a character there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can party harder than you and me and
then if we cloned each of us, and set them
[SPEAKER_02]: next to us, he would win.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would out dab us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would out whiskey us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he would look at us and be like,
why are you guys so fucked up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a professional and he's a man to the
man's man world.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he listens to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big handshake, Mr. Witt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wedding reception was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bride looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The groom, well, he was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about halfway through the night,
he decided to wear a young lady's wife
[SPEAKER_02]: beater for the rest of the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each nipple stuck out just a little bit
and he's quite a hairy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looked great in the beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You looked great through the start of the
night, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you donned the wife beater,
I threw up in my mouth a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Garden of Weeden crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody showed up looking classy as a
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you say classy as fuck,
that describes him perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence looked sharp as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maddie has always looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Mike was fucking dressed to the nines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe even brought a skateboard to skate in
this cool place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, my homie Slappy
looked sharp as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fong, we wish you were there, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fong is out of town.
[SPEAKER_02]: We miss you, Fong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a somber note right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the wedding reception, I didn't go
to the actual wedding.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pothead crew, as I was calling us,
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We chose to just go to the after.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like a wedding and then a
reception and then kind of an after party
[SPEAKER_02]: that started about 830.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the kids bailed out, we set up a dab
bar and spent Spence from the Garden of
[SPEAKER_02]: Weeden and myself, with also the help of
Maddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I missed anybody at the Garden of
Weeden listening to people, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like 9,000 thoughts in my head at
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to miss anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all you guys at the Garden of
Weeden, Siroc and Nana included,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even Honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Spence and Maddie and I were pretty
much giving out dabs to the entire wedding
[SPEAKER_02]: party that was over 21 and stuck around
after the old folks and the children left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, some of the old folks got down
better than the youngsters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had an e-nail, we had a regular
rig, and we couldn't keep up with the dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: that people were wanting because Jesse
handed me his live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me a nice chunk of live resin to
dab out the wedding party and he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: guard this with your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I volunteered to go there and be the dab
tender.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we set up a little dab bar and I needed
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I know you'll fucking give
out good dabs and I know you know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: manage dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dishing out dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting buzzed, I think, from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My head just swirled.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take a dab here in just a minute,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll slowly watch Jeff deGrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start melting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's got that weed, if you've seen
that commercial that that girl smoked and
[SPEAKER_02]: she fucking melts into the couch and
becomes like Play-Doh, if you have any of
[SPEAKER_02]: that weed and or hash, hit me up at
iGrowCulture on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're lying to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been lying to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Photoshopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did she Photoshop that chick?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some of that weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like some great shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that pink stuff in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we dished out probably seven to
ten grams of live resin last night to the
[SPEAKER_02]: wedding party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people kept coming back and coming
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably broke the dab record for
Pueblo County in one building at one time
[SPEAKER_02]: with a certain amount of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the fucking the
logistics were, but dude, we won.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing on an average day and people
are going to shit their pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take 25 dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: On an average day, maybe 30 or 40 on a
heavy dab day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone to secret cups and we've had the
judge 42 samples and I've done those all
[SPEAKER_02]: in one day and was OK and went back for
seconds on a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm I'm in the 25 to 50 dabs per day
range, which I don't know if that's that
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you see the size of dabs he does,
it is a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and what's odd is all I'll wake up and
I'll rock for a few hours before I take a
[SPEAKER_02]: dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to do a couple of things like I try
to get food and water in my body and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking check my email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you haven't taken a dab yet because if
you take that, if you get up a reasonable
[SPEAKER_02]: time somewhere between eight and ten,
you know, do your day, get some food in
[SPEAKER_02]: you, get functional, get your blood moving
and don't take a dab till seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: ten in the afternoon or the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get fucking higher than you would.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I was going to say is I wait
until like six or seven or four twenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lately, it's been too hot to get dabbed
out all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to wait until fucking six and
the sun starts going down and then by 90
[SPEAKER_02]: and get dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll take fucking seven dabs per
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sit down and take six dabs in
succession, you know, in 20 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're shaking your head because I
ruin you doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I feel bad for you, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel bad for your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sitting here shaking my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if I was doing bong hits of flour
that much though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what I'm thinking though is,
you know, I smoke flour most of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not sitting there smoking,
you know, ten bong hits of flour or if I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: just sitting there smoking by myself,
it's two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then another four or five hours later,
two more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go slower with the dabs than I do with
the flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your lungs probably your lungs are like
any anything I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a smoker too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a certain amount of inhales
and exhales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your lungs are going to give you before
they start to burn out, just like any sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of equipment or fucking device or moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that moves is going to break
eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I've only got 72 billion ins and
outs, I'd rather spend half of those on a
[SPEAKER_02]: dab than three quarters of them trying to
smoke herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should just get half of those on
oxygen, at least half.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm turning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, no, I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: My vapor to smoke ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, tonight would have been the night
that we would have done that event at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Jane's and at the hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give an apology to everybody
that was excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself was excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some bureaucracy discrepancies
and some stuff that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm no longer a member of the Citizens
for the Responsible Regulation of
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that even exists anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: To tell you the truth, I've backed out of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going to stick with being a breeder
and a podcast host and doing what I know
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go to city council meetings and
stuff when I was with another dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like being in that realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little uncomfortable to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one thing going there when you have
to, but when you're just voluntarily going
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still feels like court.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've been to court, going in the
courtroom type building, it still feels
[SPEAKER_02]: like court.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're judging you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I backed out of going to those meetings
because I felt like I was a hindrance to
[SPEAKER_02]: the group because I'm just a cliche
looking pied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't speak any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had spokespeople for the group,
so I just quit going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to know the worst thing that
I think about courtrooms is you can't wear
[SPEAKER_03]: a hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: No hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your long hair, you can't hide it from
anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hide my dreadlocks, anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no hiding these dreads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about the wedding reception.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got away sidetracked, but that's
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just having a fun episode this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Side track, dab track.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just having a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to try to do a whole bunch
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may tell you how I dry trimmed some of
this weed, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to tease about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a lot of people that I haven't seen
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Bullheaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Con.
[SPEAKER_02]: Con performed without Booger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why Booger didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he still killed it by himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Despicable Dialects rapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else performed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm going to miss somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse Witt grabbed a microphone and
rapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of people did a lot of cool
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put in the request for next
growth lesson then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw it down freestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the music's fading out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the music back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it going again.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: See?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went off without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody got home safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made sure everybody got home safe,
because they got kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people got a little bit goofy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to make sure to give shout outs
to the Garden of Weed and Crew for running
[SPEAKER_02]: the dab bar like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout outs to those guys for getting
married.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get off the topic of them getting
married, because I don't have a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: left to say about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: LiveResin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep talking about LiveResin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's tweeting me, messaging me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: WTF, LiveResin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes great, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Less filling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a very light, light love resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent Adam a text message saying,
hey bro, I got some LoveResin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I actually meant to say was
LiveResin, and so he's been laughing at
[SPEAKER_02]: that ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a pretty chunky dab of
some LiveResin right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some friends that were kind
enough to gift me a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: LiveResin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heat the torch, or I heat the nail a
little bit less heat, and make sure to use
[SPEAKER_02]: the carb cap with the LiveResin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to burn it up, because it's a
lot more terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more terpinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know about terps, that's what
mostly gives you the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flavonoids and palliates that
contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly, it's the terpinoids that you
want to taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can see the cleanliness and the
clarity in the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might have talked about it a
little on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go doing a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a dab of LiveResin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, take that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to TaskRock for making super
awesome nails and carb caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly Educated is not a sponsor of the
show, but they should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day they will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Task and I have been talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Highly Educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just took a mean dab,
so words are complicated right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to say that you can pick up
Highly Educated products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heat it a little more, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have your dab ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over here rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick up Highly Educated products
at AqualabTechnologies.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend, if you've got a rig with an
18 or 14 millimeter male joint sticking
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it, I recommend the dualitye nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a 10 millimeter,
there is a 10 millimeter domeless that
[SPEAKER_02]: works perfectly as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm catching my breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get yourself a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carb caps are the new shit and they're
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to heat your nails until
your nail is hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drop your dab in there, you let it
puddle up a little bit, you cover it with
[SPEAKER_02]: the carb cap, and it requires less heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you choke less and your dab tastes a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll need a little more heat next time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a dab, but a little more heat will
be better for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying not to heat it up because of
what you just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually heat it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I counted to 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually heat it for you when you're
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once your nail gets a little bit
older, you'll need to give it a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that you guys will learn
once it starts getting too worn out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to replace it, by the way,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving him a big old ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't even sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Task is a badass.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a pioneer for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a hell of a rapper, too, we're
listening to in the background,
[SPEAKER_02]: also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So multi-tasker, multifaceted,
ingenious man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much take a plant that is growing,
chop it down at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can flush it for 10 or 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a couple of days ago, he went
through and pulled off all the big fan
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, hang the plant upside down and
take off all the fan leaves right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it dry for like, and you know,
some guys are leaving the fan leaves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guys leave the fan leaves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially frosty strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it dry for like three to four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then chop it up into buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other guys are, this is one method
I've seen and it varies a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is basically it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop the buds off the sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just have buds and leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have all the stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, you got like a fucking five
gallon bucket or so, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to use bags, put them in bags
and put them in your normal freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a fancy freezer we'd be using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So freeze your buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them nice and frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been put them in a deep freeze is
what I've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's ran through a closed loop
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not there for that part most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll emphasize that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let them hang for like three to four
hours and take off the leaves and then
[SPEAKER_02]: freeze them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they hang to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chopped down frozen and then blasted in
the closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taken out of the closed loop system and
vacuum purge really, really gently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the process I have observed and
gathered from hanging out with all of my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are extract artists.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rush out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sound like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't have access to the
machine you need to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of specific machines
that you need to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are only a couple of brands and I
don't know exactly which two everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: would recommend to fight over.
[SPEAKER_02]: If one of them wants to sponsor the show,
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start talking about your machine on
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe someone close to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe where would they even start to look
once this develops?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would they look for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver is the only place I know of you can
get live resin right now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, and it's gone now, so I'm sorry
you guys, but it was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went fucking quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Tangy live resin at the clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 250 bucks for three grams for one
of our friends that bought some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's $85 a gram is roughly what
that comes to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you got to thank your paying for
the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's, kind of the hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of, I mean, how many people
have you seen on Facebook or anywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's our crew pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Denver crew has got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Denver crew is smoking the live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure who came up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Giddy up is one of the
first people that I ever saw smoking live
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it online, but it didn't look
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give Giddy up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do I even want to say the other
people?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like Giddy up, Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some greener side empire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That crew, I'm going to give them credit
for inventing the bare naked and the butt
[SPEAKER_02]: naked right here on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure those guys invented that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was their idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giddy up was definitely one of the
pioneers of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that I've recovered from my dab,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that smooth?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the live resin, people are arguing that
it's not cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can't be as good that the fucking
weed isn't as good because it's not cured
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's blasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the taste not incredible?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more flavorful than anything,
any shatter that I've had here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If an apple tasted like some dank weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Girl Scout Cookies weed we're
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had a Girl Scout Cookies flavored
apple and you bit into it, you know how
[SPEAKER_02]: apples take a second for that juice to
come out of the fiber of the apple and the
[SPEAKER_02]: drip into your mouth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what a weedle, if you had a
weedle, a weed apple, is that what it
[SPEAKER_02]: would taste like?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that is where compared to
shatter would be like buying slices from a
[SPEAKER_02]: bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already pre-cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that air on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not downgrading.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not meaning to downgrade shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just upgrading the live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Upgrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the upgrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 2Ds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Upgraded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a double dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're from the South if you got 2Ds and
upgrade, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never seen that movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody will get it out there and tweet
it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to shout out your Twitter
address?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Overgrow the Gov. That's my buddy
Adam over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from the South so excuse some of the
shit that he says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be changed to Adam with no
filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Adam with no filter over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just rambling, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're having fun on the podcast
this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking about maybe talking
about... Talking about maybe talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about...
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for you to catch that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I paused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to toot some horns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So live resin, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we explained that enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're blasting fresh frozen plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blast them fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vacuum purge it really lightly because the
vacuum purge fucks up your turpenoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: it collapses a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing this process, you should
know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the vacuum purge lighter and a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go lighter and longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't expect to get shatter through the
same process.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not supposed to come out like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it came out shattery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it is what we're calling sugary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like old school hash that we
fucked up, but it's almost clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes so fucking good, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm higher from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't cough from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do because I smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I could do a half gram dab
of live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because I like dropping half gram
dabs of fucking regular shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kicking the dick kind of feeling that
it gives you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess on my level, sometimes it
takes a half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube video in the making.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much live resin is on this little
sheet right here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even big enough to be
impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a lot of live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking, dude, $85 a gram at the
clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to drop a $45 gram or $45 dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: This coming from the man who has burned
quite a few things that I don't even want
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post that picture up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post a picture somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking about me burning things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a $100 bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post that picture one day somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was afraid to post it up because I
thought that I may get in trouble for
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an actual form of protest that's
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a political protest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that random, you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: I burned a $100 bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a story behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there were $200 bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a story behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a really good story behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to edit that part out,
but you never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also sent somebody's last name that
I may have to edit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to repeat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys didn't catch it the first
time, then you didn't catch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to toot my own horn,
but also I'm going to recommend that you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys go and check out Cannabis Sativa,
The Essential Guide to the World's Finest
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana Strains, edited by S.T.
[SPEAKER_02]: Owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: The name is Stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is volume 3, released by Green Candy
Press.
[SPEAKER_02]: This book is $20.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be released very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to Amazon.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that it's even out yet,
but when it comes out, you got to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking book, dude, because on page,
I think it's 45 or 54.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suffer from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 54.
[SPEAKER_02]: Page 54.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some glorious photos of Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those photos are by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took those pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took those pictures with an
Olympus.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it called now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the fucking...
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little Olympus camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a digital camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Panasonic Olympus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little 16 fucking... It's got
a real good zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a 16x zoom on it, is what's real
nice about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that thing took... All the pictures in
this were taken with that cheap... It was
[SPEAKER_02]: a $200 camera from Best Buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's published in a book, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be... So thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for putting me in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want you guys to look at the book,
support these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out great...
[SPEAKER_02]: Strain guides.
[SPEAKER_02]: The description... I wrote some of it,
and then it was given some liberty,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't write that the way that it's
written there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also am not taking credit for
creating Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not create Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: A guy named Mr. Dank from Kansas created
the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I simply put it into seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, right now it's sold out,
but there will be more made.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went so fast, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a test batch, and they went pretty
quickly to all my test crew, and they
[SPEAKER_02]: showed fucking huge potential,
and they looked like Golden Goat mommy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I made more, and I put them
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bang!
[SPEAKER_02]: They were gone, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Nature's Green Remedies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those boys know how to hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Cannabis Sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be available on Amazon if it's not
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do great work over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strain guides are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we're getting into the medical
marijuana stuff, and it's getting to be
[SPEAKER_02]: legal everywhere, people are going to want
to know about these strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be growing all this
crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we've actually got a book to kind
of document it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, the picture from Subcool on page 72
of Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never sneezed on a podcast before.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, my eyes got so heavy when I sneezed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That edible is fucking working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot all about it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't forget about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have the taste of chocolate and
peanut butter in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a cool book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that picture of East Coast Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever grew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Illuminati Seeds.
Huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's also got some of your other guys
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The La Plata Labs picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, La Plata is in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember which strain it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their picture will be easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they take amazing photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to La Plata Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Josh and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their photos are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember the name of the strain,
it'd be a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, the picture of White Diesel is
glorious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to want this book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody did a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these are better than my
Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, La Plata has a lot of very black
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Lemon Alien.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all alphabetical, so they tried to
help out the pawheads.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that amazing picture,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a lot of color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to La Plata Labs on page 86.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The coupons that I give out are good for
every brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked me if that's only good for
irie genetics products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's weird, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people don't realize that I
am irie genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So irie genetics is the largest sponsor of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never get a promotion or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first time I've ever done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to irie genetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out iriegeneticscolorado.com for
great cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some information on myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't updated the website in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a forum there if you want to join
the forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a fun little thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Nature's Green Remedies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those coupons expire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say that the fuck seed I'm
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those coupons expire this month,
but I'll give you another code.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're good for any brand,
not just mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to get some La Plata Labs,
if you want to get, there's so many good
[SPEAKER_02]: brands on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Alpha Chronic is on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gage Green is definitely on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly recommend Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Gage Green in my breeding projects
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daybreaker F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daybreaker F2 times plush berry is
actually black cherry chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see it on my face?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could definitely see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting fidgety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally fidgety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a dab and try to calm me down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, let's go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go for a walk?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I would make it far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be like, wow, that grass is really
wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I got you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said I was going to talk about trim
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We better do that because we're 49 minutes
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a long episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've needed one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do them structured, but this was
fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a Joe Rogan quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually hey is followed by a statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ending sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: A statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you're wondering what Adam looks
like, all you got to do is watch this
[SPEAKER_02]: cartoon called King of the Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a character named Lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: In about 10 years, Adam's going to look
just like Lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in the truck, Lou Ann.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to give a shout out to anybody
while I do a dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't really want to give a shout
out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is that this stuff that you're
dabbing is 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want one of these next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I damn sure don't want to split it
with her.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just eat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And make her extremely jealous.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who I'll give a shout out to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give a shout out to my wife because
she's sitting at home while I'm sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: here dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just his wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, Christy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just dropped the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought that was a rig, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: My heart dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it at the edge of the table because
it was hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had it face down right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It scared me, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fat dab of live resin after how high
I was from that edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a fun end of a show
section.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if it ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we just podcast indefinitely?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we could do a live feed,
couldn't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever Google hang out and just then
release it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever eat an LSD where you got into
that bubble where you don't want to leave
[SPEAKER_02]: where you are because you're just like,
I'm here and I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how the podcast has me right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm secure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my little station right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a book to read if something goes
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my little station.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm secure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the internet's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the internet is back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet was down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concast, come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't even going to say the C word.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Concast?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they should work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should work past 12 o'clock to 4 o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because unlike them, other people do
things at those hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I'm not going to say what
people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say that people need to
do that on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I finish this cough, here we go with
a miniature grow lesson on dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bear in mind, I ate a 350 milligram
edible that is highly effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get them to slow down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Adam will help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll even turn on the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's highly distracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I love these songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Task Rock's awesome, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wear rubber gloves for almost all of
everything that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the blue nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got them at Walmart and Walgreens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pull the plant out of the room,
I guess, and just chop it down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hang it upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that bottom branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very bottom branch where the first
fucking set of buds are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hang that over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you could string up a line
across the room or maybe use like a coat
[SPEAKER_02]: hanger, depending on how many you have
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wherever you're hanging it,
that's your new little hanger.
[SPEAKER_02]: That little Y, that first intersection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll grab like a fuzzy stick,
a pack of fuzzy sticks from Walmart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a pipe cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking the thing around your bread bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a bunch of those kind of things,
little twisty tie sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrap that around the stock and just kind
of secure it onto whatever you're hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: it to a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes that branch will break
if you got a heavy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go to the second branch,
go for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secure it on there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to secure it either way,
just because I'm fucking OCD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want my plants falling on the
floor after they've been growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking 125 days or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to be all right,
Princess?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're turning colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, don't call me Princess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be lucky to talk, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This edible works.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want to buy an edible,
I recommend the Mountain Medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But know your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat half of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, don't even do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat a quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high, and I'm a professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: If something's working for you,
I know it's going to work for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say I'm a professional,
and this is fucking me up in such a good
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I bought that 315-milligram drink,
I thought that it was going to fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you literally told me,
I want one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we could play some Grateful Dead
music without getting the show in trouble
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I am high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to listen to Jack Straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's a dead head out there,
you know where I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I say, I just need to hear Jack Straw,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody knows where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody knows where I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody wearing a fucking tight-eyed
shirt is out there going, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, and they're going to play Jack Straw
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got the plant, and it's hanging
upside down, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get off the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is a good time to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some growers do that a few days before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should have recommended that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a few days before harvest,
go in there and take off all your big fan
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can do that right as you harvest,
or you can do it as it's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get those big fan leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, your plants are hanging upside down
in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I should have wrote this down,
because I'm getting really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a lot of humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 25% to 30% max, maximum humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to have some air moving,
but not your fans blowing directly on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll crisp them up a little too
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want them to dry a little bit slowly
while they're hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got whole plants hanging upside
down, minus fan leaves, just hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humidity is kind of low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to go cold, but you don't
want to go hot either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 70, 75 is a good area for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like what they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you are is where they're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine hang in a work area, where it's a
little dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it dark in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine it could go to possibly
80.
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 would probably be OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll crisp them up a little faster than
you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Closet if you have to, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you're getting air to them,
if you are doing a closet or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And air, because moving air prevents mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In every grow situation, moving more air
prevents mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing is humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not even realize how much water is
involved in growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every gallon you pour in is coming
back out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to move that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to get rid of it or utilize it
somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the room with the right
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the room with the right
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's dark, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As dark as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to dedicate space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a lot of air moving,
so you don't get moldy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now just let them dry up for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some that have been hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants we trimmed tonight were cut
down on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've almost been going for two
weeks, hanging up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a little humid, because
we've had a swamp cooler going in that
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in that area, but in a room like
three, a hallway down, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a swamp cooler in there,
just because that's what that room came
[SPEAKER_02]: equipped with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got to run that fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in an enclosed area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it still makes a little humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little bit of humidity in the
rest of the grow environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while they're sitting there,
hanging for about 14 days is where they've
[SPEAKER_02]: been.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't have any fan leaves on
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to check them every other
day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start checking them about four days,
five days, six days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them a little squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when those fan leaves or the little
sugar leaves start crisping right off just
[SPEAKER_02]: by hitting them with your finger,
grab those plants and just take like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have these long bins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just take branches off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the plants hanging, and I cut
branches off and lay them into the bins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once my bins are full, I go to a
seeded area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've got to sit down to trim,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it'll drive you nuts trying to stand
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I know I'm old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stand to trim anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to sit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut one bud off at a time and just knock
the leaves off of it with my thumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now that it's dry, those leaves
are pretty much just going to fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see what your finished product
is as you're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trim it to your liking at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're selling it for stupid cheap a
pound and just hustle and wait to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: out, don't trim it worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why cheap weed is cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want connoisseur grade weed,
take your time and trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, I don't want to smoke all your
skin flakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your weed's that sticky, then
definitely wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have something to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam loves the finger hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're wearing good rubber gloves,
you can rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't scrape the fucking latex right out
of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll learn how to rub the hash off
of your fingers and make a little hash
[SPEAKER_02]: ball or a little hash tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch a video on making, what was it
called?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't, because you're saying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the hand hash when Arjun goes and
makes charas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Charas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch a video on how to make charas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll figure out real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the buds are pretty much dry,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got them in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hung.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're crispy now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hand trimming them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cut off like you got a bunch of sticks
in a bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take that fucking stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut off little individual buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just knock the leaves off with
your thumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use scissors now if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of pointless.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am faster just thumbing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you're playing Nintendo with
a bud in your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going up it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just take you a couple seconds
to get each bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see, like I said, you can see
the finished result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really cool is if you wet trim,
you've got to trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're all sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fucks up your scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time you set a bud down or touch
a bud, it's fucking sticky there and
[SPEAKER_02]: stickier and sticky here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry trimming is way cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may sound weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you're done trimming,
you can weigh your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how much I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's done at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would the leaves not pull out moisture
anyways?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's ideal to leave them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're ducks for the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're what's struggling to suck up the
moisture, not the bud, really,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's mostly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, it helps slow it down because
you want the water to leave more slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because that lets the chlorophyll
evaporate with the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the water is gone, you can't take
away any more chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you let the water come out slowly,
then that chlorophyll dissolves with the
[SPEAKER_02]: water and goes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happens in the cure process also.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gases start converting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting into cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go there later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you now, like most of the
videos that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it an hour and I'm high as shit on
that edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only took like 45 minutes to kick in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little better now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've calmed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a minute there, I was really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hands are still like on your chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're holding yourself to your seat right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will tell me you're a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, seriously, if you are not an
experienced and don't try to be cool
[SPEAKER_02]: because I smoke a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be that lady from NBC or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be writing a story about freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you'll piss your pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't eat 350 milligrams unless you're
experienced because you will piss your
[SPEAKER_02]: pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being a bad example on my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, you are an experienced
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the comfortable ability of your
own home.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a homie here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the perfect spot to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is no different than drinking a
bottle of tequila.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may troll the internet a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until your spelling goes and then it's
going to be like, who the hell is this
[SPEAKER_03]: asshole?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about the most trouble I'm going to
be tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did we get through trimming weed
because I'm hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I always say, are we done trimming
weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your worst part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell how many times a grower or a
person in the trim circle has been around
[SPEAKER_02]: pot by how fucking eager they are to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like, are we going to trim
tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like your second, third, maybe fourth
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like, hey, I got to fucking trim
a bunch of weed tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a couple of crops down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it and hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it because I get to finally check
out my babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to see like, oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get to fucking take those pretty flowers
and blast them into shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to take all that trim and make
shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one cool thing about dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you're done dry trimming,
you can haul that trim off over to your
[SPEAKER_02]: extract artist guy and he can do his thing
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've cured trim before and blasted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very unnoticeably different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't tell the difference between
batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say that's not the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut down crops, really, if I'm making
hash out of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we'll run Girl Scout Cookies
whole plants and just make dabs out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll cut it down a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to take it 63 days, usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll cut it down to like 55, 56,
right at the end of eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a mocha frappuccino.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that dirt coffee chocolate taste
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl Scout Cookies hash, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, let's put some music in the
background again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned it down to give that grow lesson
and talk and it disappeared forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you got more questions about dry
trimming weed, please let me know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I seriously am fucking high as
fuck off that edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you looking around for,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just making sure we covered
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just helping you help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like you helping me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for helping me help myself,
because you make a good copilot tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the little trim girl that
came over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have said that earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did, but it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she helped trim, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: She saved hours of the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good song.
[SPEAKER_02]: This song makes me think of Addison Demora
fucking singing it one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew like every, at the one point where
it was, he like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're running video of this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not running any video.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, it's definitely a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little lit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been this high on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like you could derail at any
moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to freak out or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just high and giddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like you've died and nobody
will tell you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I do want to like take my mic off
the stand and stand up and dance around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was a concert right now,
I would be front row and my hands would be
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I'd be screaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm ready, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad it's dark time and everyone's in
bed and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry that everybody's so
disappointing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be coming out on a Monday
morning and everyone's going to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's wrong with him?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's all fucking sloppy today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been an hour, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you want to cover?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, guys, if I fucked up the grow
tip, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've said wrong shit before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to tell you the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about correcting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about people not getting the
wrong information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want you guys to do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I said, I'm the captain of
this pirate ship.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that know you in real life,
they know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just laugh that shit off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ate 350 milligrams and took like 72
dabs today.
[SPEAKER_03]: With an I Heart Dab shirt on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am wearing an I Heart Dab shirt.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to take some more dabs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably fucking... You can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take another dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably just enough for two dabs
of live resin on this little piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: parchment right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're smoking up all your live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, that's what it's for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to take dabs of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do any good sitting on a piece
of parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to, as somebody else sitting
here at the table, I want to share the
[SPEAKER_03]: wealth and like, goodness man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You contributed to a hell of a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your close friends definitely deserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anybody out there listening to that is
one of you folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's skip this song.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little skit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to listen to a skit on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out of butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to switch to the
e-nail pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You came prepared though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the e-nail sitting on the table
right here with the highly educated
[SPEAKER_02]: infinity nail rigged up, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's impressive to say the least.
[SPEAKER_03]: The e-nail?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only the second time I've seen it,
but from the South we don't have no fancy
[SPEAKER_03]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the bong of the century.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean electricity?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No disrespect to the South, only Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Adam and his trailer park in that
small town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it enough for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: The railroad tracks behind his trailer
park.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is the power plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that why you're kind of mutated?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's debilitating is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get any government grants from any
of that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, they just want to like do a
bunch of studies and research,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, like I said, I've had the bong for
the past 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everybody would come around to
smoke my dual chamber water ice cooled
[SPEAKER_03]: bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much did you pay for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: $400?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the people that are coming here
to buy the rec weed are straight up from
[SPEAKER_02]: the South.
[SPEAKER_02]: They drive all the way out here on a
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas or Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same damn thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine driving it from fucking Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's medical and shit in other
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you can't go there and get it as
easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to prove residency,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in, sorry, I'm totally
interrupting you because I'm high and
[SPEAKER_02]: rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado and you're
on the very South end of Pueblo at mile
[SPEAKER_02]: marker exit 91, hit that exit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you come off the exit,
you need to go North just a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: from the exit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is the greener side dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a certain time period in the
early evening, right as the sun sets,
[SPEAKER_02]: the LED UFO lights come on in the
greenhouse to keep the plants from
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering early in the bloom season.
[SPEAKER_02]: From about a mile and a half away,
this fucking 120 by 30 foot greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is, illuminates this purple
blue spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't know what it is,
it is the craziest looking fucking thing
[SPEAKER_02]: ever, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all lit up last night when I was
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just driving past, but I was on
I-25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you look over, you're like,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like aliens are landing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a cool thing to like fucking
really fucking wreck her and take her out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just go to the greener side dispensary
and buy yourself fucking recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're open until like 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go out there around 7,
730 and buy, I don't recommend that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably call them and ask them
what time the UFO lights come on and tell
[SPEAKER_02]: them that you want to come check out the
purple greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll probably tell you what time
those turn off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a greenhouse, so the schedule
is going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to do it to keep the
plants from going into flower early.
Come visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fun people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of fun stuff to do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a frisbee golf park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disc golf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disc golf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you any good?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've never played.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out there and got really high for
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chase the frisbee and fucking smoke some
balls in the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, dude, if you just bring a
couple of joints, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went out there and I was like,
I got joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, nah, dude, we don't want
your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I don't blame you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a lot better weed than I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who were these guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just back in fucking Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tennessee stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like everybody had better weed than
you in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody had better weed than me in
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Loke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your shitty weed for years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Tennessee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 50 guys in Tennessee going,
yeah, you just gave me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you take a dab or did I just take one
and be stingy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something left here,
that means I didn't share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a little left here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even see you take one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I took it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it down like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I took a dab because the dabber is
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure you didn't just drop off?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the side of your computer?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like 137%, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's a big percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some accountant out there pulling
his hair out right now going, fuck you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't have 137%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, they don't come to the
agriculture podcast for statistics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't seen how many grams per watt
I pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, keep listening to the podcast and you
might grow yourself and find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard this girl say, uh, she can pull
two plus pounds of Kong per thousand watt
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was using a four by eight,
uh, fucking botanic hair trays on tables,
[SPEAKER_02]: like elevated, uh, with fucking lights
every five thousand watt lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: every five feet and rows of five lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a lot of details for this
chick's room, but she was claiming that
[SPEAKER_02]: she, and I'm not doubting her,
but she was saying that she pulls fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: two plus pounds of Kong per fucking cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be funny, a lot of details would
have been like address when she's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a fucking, that's a fat pull if
she's doing that, props.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, but then again, coming from East and
just watching videos, the only place you
[SPEAKER_03]: can watch videos of that nature,
forums and YouTube and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people sometimes exaggerate and
I'm not saying she is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some pictures that may,
that may do her justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have just eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to, she needs to send me the dick
pics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean of the dick plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like actually some dick pics because
this is the internet age.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go on a podcast saying someone
needs to send me some dick pics,
[SPEAKER_02]: like within fucking 44 seconds of this
being released, your Twitter is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: go and you're going to get dick pics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll ask for followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll ask for support for your family
with cancer and people will ignore you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ask for a dick pic on a podcast and
fucking everybody in America is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: flash you a dick pic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You let me ask for what I want to ask for.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you fucking clearly give your
fucking Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm retweeting everything to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you're checking out the
iGrowCulture podcast, Twitter,
[SPEAKER_02]: please refrain from the cock picks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like pictures of fat buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go home and I'll make my wife a
Twitter account and you can send her cock
[SPEAKER_03]: pics.
[SPEAKER_03]: She likes the penis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that's the first she likes
the penis reference on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised it wasn't from Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty dope task rock song.
[SPEAKER_02]: It bumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it time to end the podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going at it for an hour and 13
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything cool to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanted to hang out and do a random
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to fucking kind of roll with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know if we got enough random in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels random.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I fucked up a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: People count on me and I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ask for details.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we do after we got the leaves?
[SPEAKER_02]: You throw them in a bucket and let them
sit there for a couple of days to crisp
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, you put them in a jar
and start curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from there is curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if I want to get into
curing yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about that when I'm not
wrecked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to write that down and
fucking in two or three episodes from now,
[SPEAKER_02]: guess what we'll do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cure some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we went way out of order because
we're only in veg in that actual lessons,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was trimming weed tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was crispy in my range.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally think you dry it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's got to get cured a little bit
from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're sending it out of town,
you just fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to smoke yourself or
with your homies or use it for medical
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes, we got to cure it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be proud of it.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: That edible is bubbling up in my stomach
and made me burp all kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tastes like fucking weed and
fucking peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's end this podcast up while we're
still all sane.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I ate 350 milligrams of
cannabis edibles and I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't recommend that you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't advocate that type of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend this package that's 50
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say start with 25 or 50
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be technical, I dared you to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a dare.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking would have done it without your
dare, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to eat a lot of edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing got me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes in waves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it worth $11?
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's hard to say because some
people like their spending habits are
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where you choose to put your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a weird rant, but my mom will say
everything is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two pennies.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that's so expensive because she's
from back in the day when that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter of a penny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's fucking she just sees it as,
oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's just so it's kind of your
but for me, that was well worth 11 bucks
[SPEAKER_02]: is my fucking really short answer of a lot
of long words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying usually things on that
level are a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you well, an edible, yeah, an edible is
10 to 15 bucks, maybe 20 bucks for
[SPEAKER_02]: something really potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to a concert or something
and you want to get fucking high as fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: and not have to worry about smoking
through it because that's why I like
[SPEAKER_02]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to a comedy show and you can't smoke
at the comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will throw you the fuck out and
you're highly visible in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place is tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eat a fat edible and just sit in there
and grin like a tard the whole night.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be beautiful for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone likes to say pregame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat it about fucking north end of Denver
if you're driving up from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking eat that fucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop and get gas at that one gas station.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the gas station.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 196 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat that fucker in the parking lot and
then get back on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time you get to comedy works,
you'll have a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or wherever you're going in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's just my... But this was,
yeah, it was worth 11 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to... I was going to
go, at least I want to go up there and get
[SPEAKER_02]: some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That $11 included tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their dispensary includes tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 11 bucks flat out the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like fucking vegan or something,
I don't know what their option is for you
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's super chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're diabetic, you're going to
have to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course you're not supposed to eat
seven doses all at once like I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got me rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in moderation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go big or go home on the agriculture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to thank you guys for
listening to me ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't the fucking edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go find something super
entertaining to do with myself now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, thanks to all the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to you Natural Mystic Cannabis
Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big high five across the table to Adam for
coming and doing a fucking hour and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: long podcast with me.

having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got TaskRock in my right ear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as loud as everybody else hears
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it bumped up a little more on my
headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it going on over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But guys, go leave some comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that I love fucking comments on
Facebook, on iTunes, on Twitter,

[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't read any comments this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even check to see if they were
