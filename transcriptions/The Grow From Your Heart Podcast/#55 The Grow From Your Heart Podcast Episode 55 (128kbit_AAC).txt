[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks a lot for the sweet comment,
Fat Anklefoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that Soma inspired you and
started a lot of your teachings because
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hanging out with a friend who grew
weed and I had that spiritual aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that before I ever knew about Soma,
so I multiplied on it or expanded on it
[SPEAKER_01]: once I found Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you knew Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're a Soma fan, and,
dude, thanks for using worms in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, and thanks for trying to go
organic, and thanks for listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: and super thanks for the comment and the
five stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're part of the crew now, so welcome to
the crew, Fat Anklefoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I read this comment on the last
episode, but this one is from Buzzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thanks for making this for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, dude, you're super welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to send us a comment,
I'd love to read your comments on a future

[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let me know if you want your name
said or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't always tell everybody that you
grow cannabis if you don't live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feels like enough intro stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a solo episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk a little bit about the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company was kind
enough to give me a tour of the worm farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to talk a little bit about
my company, I read genetics, and I'll also
[SPEAKER_01]: talk a little bit about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a lot of emails about
feminized seeds, so I'll explain my method
[SPEAKER_01]: of making those a little later in the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's start with the Rocky Mountain
Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, I was invited to go visit the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company and they gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me a little tour of the building and I got
to see where the worm castings are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a giant facility,
but what they do have is super clean and
[SPEAKER_01]: super organized and I was pretty
impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hang out with Jay and Sean and
Alan for a few minutes and they taught me
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot about worms and worm castings and
why they use specific worms that they use
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some worms you guys only eat the top layer
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put them in a big thing of dirt,
like if it's a field of dirt or if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a bucket full of dirt, they will only
eat the top layer and they don't dig down.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys actually know which worms eat
the top, which worms eat the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that some worms will eat every
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some worms will travel through all of the
dirt or whatever your putting them in and
[SPEAKER_01]: they will eat and digest all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys knew a lot about their worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed me worms in every single stage
of growth, every single stage of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of keep the worms in five gallon
buckets and they let me open the buckets
[SPEAKER_01]: with the worm farms in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to feel the texture of the medium in
which the worms live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of airy, it's kind of fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels a lot like the soil that I mix
for my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I thought was really cool
is what they're feeding the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really cool in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parts of the worm diet is dried and ground
herb from a company called Openn Vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Openn Vape makes vapor pen cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're extracting the CBD or THC from a
plant and making oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they send all the leftover material
to the worm company to feed the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worm company is using ground up plant
stalks and leaves and whatever else was
[SPEAKER_01]: left of the plants after harvest,
after the making oil part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feeding the ground up plant matter
back to the worms and then the worms are
[SPEAKER_01]: making castings out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those castings are being used to grow my
cannabis and probably those worm castings
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully make it back to Openn Vape and
go back into their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of doing an in-house recycling
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes full circle without us creating
more stuff, without something being tossed
[SPEAKER_01]: into a dumpster for the trash guy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine when you harvest you have every
plant has a stalk and stems and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you let that dry grind it up
and had some worms to feed that to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't have to throw all that away
and you wouldn't have to make so many
[SPEAKER_01]: trips to the dump or wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just super efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was completely impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Jay and
Sean and Alan and Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like hanging out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worm factory is a cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely be back there soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys threw a handful of products my
way and I'm kind of starting to implement
[SPEAKER_01]: them in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to slowly adjust from the
non-organic bottled stuff to the organics
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't want to ruin the organic
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm learning what I can switch out and
what I can use together and these guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely moving me along quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been feeding my plants worm castings
for about a month now and I can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: see an improvement in my crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I noticed I would say that
after introducing worm castings and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Kashi is that my plants are just simply
more active.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're greener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see more growth and they also seem to
want more water, which tells me they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and taking nutrients more than
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely encourage the use of grow
Kashi and worm castings as a nice way to
[SPEAKER_01]: just start leaning toward the organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I've been talking about
them for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn more about the worm
company, I definitely recommend you check
[SPEAKER_01]: out their online presence is www
.rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you will learn a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can stop by their store,
check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them I sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that in the beginning, but go
there, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big, huge shout out to the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't get enough of that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I want to talk about is
irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a couple of emails every week about
irie genetics with questions about irie
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody just asked me why I don't
talk about irie genetics on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show isn't really about irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is about candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try not to focus too much on my own
company, but it seems like you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it seems fair that I talk about
it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to toot my own horn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a sip here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about irie genetics,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics is, of course,
my seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed regular and feminized cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, irie genetics is pretty much
sold out of seeds for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature's Green Remedies is my main
distributor, and they got most of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Left over after I hooked up most of my
local friends with my latest harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to get the locals,
all my friends, all my Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my company is called irie genetics
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is what allowed me to become this
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the local people should get
the irie genetics products first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way I get to see what they grow
and I get to take pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not trying to be rude about it,
but the locals always get served up first
[SPEAKER_01]: after I feel like everybody's gotten their
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure Nature's Green Remedies gets
what they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really can't make enough seeds to
meet the demand lately, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make more golden goat and
lemon Jeffrey seeds here really soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boys for that project are actually in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make fem seeds or seeds in
general, you got to start the boys off a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit ahead of the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the males are in flower now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girls will go in flower in a couple of
few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those should be ready in about 90 days
from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this episode will come out March
1st or 2nd and 90 days from then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have lemon Jeffrey and golden
goat seeds available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually wrote down the wrong strain and
I almost said the wrong strain and teased
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I'm making more lemon Jeffrey and
I'm making more golden goat right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be ready in about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The locals will get them first.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no waiting list.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a way to get on a waiting list
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: After my locals get served up,
they will be dished out to Nature's Green
[SPEAKER_01]: Remedies and naturesgreenremedies.com will
sell out quickly, I promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll make an announcement on this show
before they go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I make those lemon Jeffrey and the
golden goats, I'm also going to put a new
[SPEAKER_01]: cut called Kalonji Kush in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kalonji Kush is the grateful dog
pollinated the Tahoe OG and I call it
[SPEAKER_01]: Kalonji Kush after a reggae artist named
Sizzla Kalonji.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wondering where my weird names
come from, Kalonji is a reggae artist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sizzla Kalonji.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to cross the golden goat to
the Sizzla Kalonji and I want to call that
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunshine Girl, which is actually a Sizzla
song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's going to be pretty cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple more ideas that I'm going
to put in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two more females that are going in
there for sure, but I don't want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: too much about them until I've got some
seeds in my hands from those because,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, let me tell you a weird side story.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I reversed a golden goat plant,
a female golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I treated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned it into a male and I'll talk more
about that later in the show how I do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I turned this female plant into a male
and it created pollen and I put that
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen on a room full of plants and that's
how I created the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I made golden goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another cross in the room that's
never been released or shown to anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: because it only made a few seeds and those
are mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also sprinkled that pollen on
another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain was headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a headband cut that I got from my
good buddy, Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me that headband cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprinkled pollen on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that plant took the pollen,
the plant died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within 24 hours, that plant was dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other plant in the room was healthy
and happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It showed signs of being pollinated just
like it should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that headband plant died within 24
hours of taking feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never heard of that from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has an explanation for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant was healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put another headband in
there and I'm going to hit it with golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat pollen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a name for it, but I'm
hesitant to say it on the show because
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going to rip me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I say it, then no one can steal it
from me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm saying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat is going to pollinate the
headband plant and I will call it the
[SPEAKER_01]: halo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, you got a headband and now it's
gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's above your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the halo, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call the headband to the
golden goat, the halo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Kalanji Kush to the golden goat
will be the sunshine, girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are coming up, you guys,
about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll need some testers, but I didn't say
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see more about iri genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently started my work on making black
cherry chem F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: F2 is phenyl generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made the F1s, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's plush berry was pollinated by a
daybreaker plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seeds that came out of there were
called F1, the first phenyl generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I grew a bunch of them out and I
found the male that I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've recently found three females that
are good candidates for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm waiting for these plants to finish
before I commit to which females I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to use to continue the line into F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I choose one, I'm going to,
I'm going to choose two of them actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to hit both of them with the
male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will keep all of the seeds
separate so that it's phenotype number
[SPEAKER_01]: seven and eight are the two that I'm
really eyeballing for my females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll keep black cherry chem seven and
black cherry chem eight separate and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: all the seeds out and I'll grow a hundred
of each one of those and see which one
[SPEAKER_01]: shows me what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will keep that one to continue
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm waiting for these plants to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to dry them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to turn some of it into dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke some of it as flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see which one I really liked the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that will be used to make the F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really trying to stay able to
stabilize the purple trait in that strain
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really want, right now I'm getting
about a little more than 50% purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I run a pack of 50, I'll have 25
purple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make it up to closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get like 75% purple plants out
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time I'm done,
I'd like to see that purple plant come out
[SPEAKER_01]: almost every time is what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan to take it to F5 over the next few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll breed the F2s this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've seen out of it that's
really cool is some of the phenotypes look
[SPEAKER_01]: done and they're only 55 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've made a purple strain with a chem
flavor that finishes in about 55 to 65
[SPEAKER_01]: days, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my Black Cherry Chem project
that's going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out pictures of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them on Instagram and I also put
them on my forum on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to iregeneticscolorado.com,
go to the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be really cool if you joined the
forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign up and join the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't cost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing weird is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just a member now and you can
communicate with us and participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every week I go and post a weekly grow
journal of my own gardens up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Black Cherry Chem has been
highlighted quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a lot of great pictures of
Black Cherry Chem on my website right now
[SPEAKER_01]: in the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go there and check it out if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ask me questions there and you
talk to me, I really, that's my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: place to go and communicate with people
because they can't censor me because I own
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook can't shut that down or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do what you want to do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I think you're a dick, I might tell you
to quit being a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, grow weed and post your weed
pictures there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I can talk about is I'm looking
for an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise is a golden goat that was pollinated
by Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really love that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a great smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes great flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants put on super resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow in a good amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're real stout plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of staking on it if
you find the right phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking for an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to use Arise in a long-term
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will be my long-term breeding male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some beautiful things from the
strain and I'm sure that a good male will
[SPEAKER_01]: make some more amazing crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin production from that plant is so
impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll be a few months before I select
an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Feminize Golden Goat Lemon
Jeffrey project ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Black Cherry Chem ahead of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that will be the Arise male
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to find a good Arise male for my
permanent breeding stud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I plan to make 15 to 20 F1 hybrids
with the Arise to see what works when I do
[SPEAKER_01]: find that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want to see what can be improved on
or what I need to abandon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you breed, if you take a male
plant and you hit six or seven female
[SPEAKER_01]: plants with it, don't be afraid to throw
away a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take a male plant in a room with
however many females you're going to put
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, five, six, maybe 20 females,
you're going to make that many new
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to grow some of each batch of
seeds yourself before you can do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you give them to like your friend
and you say, these are untested,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, because you don't want to put out
seeds that you don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the seeds and grow at least 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say a hundred if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're limited on space and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a phenol hunt of a hundred plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really shows you what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But grow some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they totally suck, throw them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds crazy, but there are
enough strains on the planet to where if
[SPEAKER_01]: you just made some bullshit that doesn't
improve the genetic line, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we need that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be so attached to your new creation
that, oh, it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have thrown away more strains than I
have kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all talk about the lemon kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had high hopes for the lemon
kush that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That strain sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grew big fat donkey dicks for buds,
but you couldn't get high off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not make resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the phenotypes on that plant made
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just that cross did not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the seeds are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the clones are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That project has been abandoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that's a failed project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasted some time, but I don't want to
waste more time or more people's time with
[SPEAKER_01]: the same project by sending out shitty
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a rant on not being too
attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lesson in attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're too attached to that strain,
then you're wasting your time growing
[SPEAKER_01]: something that sucks, and you could have
been growing something way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have been breeding something
that was way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you got to learn to let things
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that lesson I talked about,
my rig that I dropped?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to sweep it up and move on
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I do get all these new strains
made, I will need help testing these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I like to run 100 myself,
but I will also send out a bunch of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: to reliable testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I know you're a reliable
tester is you've joined my web forum and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have posted pictures of your previous
grows on my forum and you stay in contact
[SPEAKER_01]: with me and you show that you're serious
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of how I find my testers is
off of my own website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future, if you're interested in
testing, I read genetic seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would help you a lot to join the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do play favorites that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what else to say about I read
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the head breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make 99% of the decisions with help from
my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do let the people around me kind of give
their input because they're cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, growers, smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot to say, but that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics is all Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have trim friends that helped me shout
out to everybody that's ever came and
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me trim some I read genetic stuff
or shout out to all the people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me package seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future I am going to get away
from the feminine seed market as much
[SPEAKER_01]: because feminine seeds are a pain in the
ass to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we should all eventually
step up our game and learn to just grow
[SPEAKER_01]: regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we didn't have male plants,
we wouldn't have more plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's my responsibility to put out more
regular seeds, I think, than I do
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see better shit come from the
regular crosses than I do the fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, feminized seeds are stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't improve on them too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cross that you make, that's what you
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see when I cross, if it's feminized,
if I cross plant A and plant B,
[SPEAKER_01]: they come out a little bit better than A
and B were, but you can't make them super
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I take a regular male plant and a
female plant and cross that, I see much
[SPEAKER_01]: better stuff come out of that,
much more improved plants, transgressive
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My offspring will outperform each parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that only happens when I'm using
regular pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't make that happen with my feminized
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a couple of reasons why I
will eventually abandon the feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's eventually, I'm not saying soon,
but one of these days I will stop making
[SPEAKER_01]: fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to say about
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much I could say, but I feel
like I'm just stroking my own ego over
[SPEAKER_01]: here talking about iRe a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support iRegenetics, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Rastafarian seed company by a Rasta
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having mass produced
commercial seeds, you've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every seed was touched by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every plant was touched by me,
by my Rastafarian hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a little bit of Rasta love in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that means something to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather buy products from a small
company that cares about their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than the Walmart of whatever industry
you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get on to another topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that I wanted to talk about
feminized seeds a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people seem to have
misconceptions on what feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: are, on how they're made, on where they
come from, and on what they will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that feminized seeds are
straight up hermaphrodite seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I've got a pretty popular seed
company that only sold feminized seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we came up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how iRegenetics would be
popular and or reliable if we just sold a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of damn herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with some basics here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean to have feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a few random notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminized seeds mean that the seeds will
produce all female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only say 99% female plants because
this is science and nature and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll be 99% females.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is helpful because new growers don't
know how to identify male plants in their
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing feminized seeds,
you don't have to watch for the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also makes things easier for growers
when they have limited space because the
[SPEAKER_01]: grower knows that every seed planted will
be a usable female and none of their
[SPEAKER_01]: space, soil, nutrients, water,
electricity, none of that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: wasted on growing a male plant that had to
be chopped down 10 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feminized seeds mean that all of the
seeds will produce female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here is where some people are
confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are feminized seeds made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay close attention because honestly you
guys, I'm amazed with myself that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: giving out this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my biggest secrets that I
don't usually share with anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab and a drink before
I share this, but I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: quick dab and a quick drink and then I
will teach you guys how I make reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds on a semi-large scale for
nature's green remedies and patients
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a quick second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab and a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right guys, I am back and heavily
medicated after that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to tell you how I make my
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I got to warn you that the
chemicals that I will describe here are a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit dangerous and you need to
follow the safety rules for these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not responsible for you hurting
yourself or making yourself sick with
[SPEAKER_01]: these chemicals, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm simply telling you how I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do this, follow the instructions,
wear gloves, wear goggles, do everything
[SPEAKER_01]: safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I start is I order silver
nitrate and sodium thiosulfate from a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific supply company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get powdered versions of silver nitrate
and sodium thiosulfate and I mix
[SPEAKER_01]: those two into another container and now
I've got 100% silver thiosulfate in that
[SPEAKER_01]: third container and I will dilute that to
a certain dilution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some plants will need stronger
dilutions of the silver thiosulfate and
some plants will need stronger dilutions
of the silver thiosulfate and I mix those
two into another container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some plants will need lighter
dilutions of the silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've learned is some plants I can
treat, some plants one time with the
[SPEAKER_01]: silver thiosulfate at a high dilution just
before flower, the day before flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: that will work for that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them I have to make the dilution
much weaker and spray it multiple times
[SPEAKER_01]: and some plants I have to make it stronger
and only spray it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way you'll learn this is
through experimentation by trying plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: by trying different dilutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the silver nitrate into one
container of water, I put the thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_01]: into another container of water,
I shake them up to where it dissolves,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mix equal amounts into another container
and then I take that container and dilute
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the proper dilution for the plant
that I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will, I'm gonna use golden goat
because I just did this to golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: about seven days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took three golden goat plants and I put
them in a small space where there aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: any other plants around, there's no wind
to where my spray is not going to randomly
[SPEAKER_01]: land on other plants because I don't want
to reverse other plants on accident in
[SPEAKER_01]: this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took my three golden goat plants,
I put them in a small confined space and I
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed them with my silver thiosulfate
mix at the proper dilution and I sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants to the point where they are
dripping from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants were covered in this silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful because if you use the silver
thiosulfate at a strong dilution,
[SPEAKER_01]: it may turn things purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the floor where the spray lands on,
the wall behind it, it may turn,
[SPEAKER_01]: it may leave little purple marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful or a little shiny purple
mark like shiny iridescent looking marks,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of neat the way it looks,
but it'll screw some stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want your things purple,
be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spray the plants, then I let them sit
and dry because I want them dry before
[SPEAKER_01]: they go in a flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I let the plants dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I carry those plants to the flower
room where they will go into flower and I
[SPEAKER_01]: try to spray them right before the lights
off for the flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get sprayed, they dry,
and then they go into the flower room and
[SPEAKER_01]: the lights go off and they have now just
gone into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the Golden Goat, I can spray it
one time the day of flower and in about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: days, that plant will show me male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, people are saying, how does that
work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to explain this to you kind of
slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention because I'm trying to
explain it to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any notes on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just freestyling right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is, when we spray a female
plant with silver thiosulfate solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: the thiosulfate acts as a carrier for the
silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silver isn't really absorbed by the
leaves easily, but the thiosulfate makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it get in there a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're tricking the plants into taking
the silver by absorbing the thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when the silver reaches the plants,
the silver disrupts the copper movement in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is copper in your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the silver will disrupt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that copper movement is disrupted in
the plant system, it responds by
[SPEAKER_01]: triggering an ethylene response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an ethylene production,
it's an ethylene response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ethylene response tells the plant
that something is seriously wrong and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: time to go into survival mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant's survival method is to
create male flowers that will create
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen because now all that plant wants to
do is shoot pollen and reproduce to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the species alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've disrupted the copper, the plant's
freaking out, it panics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The panic causes ethylene to move through
the plant in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ethylene triggers the plant to throw
out flowers that are male flowers that
[SPEAKER_01]: produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since those plants, that female
plant, is all female, it does not have any
[SPEAKER_01]: male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason it is showing male sex
parts is because I've stressed it and
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will now throw out male parts that
contain pollen and that pollen will be all
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, my throat's clogging up here
from the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take another drink of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that should help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got female plants that are
spitting out all female pollen and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking that pollen and of course putting
it on female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've never introduced any male
pollen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said before, 99% of those plants
should come out female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I can say 99% is
because, like I said, it's science and
[SPEAKER_01]: nature and shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also your grow room can cause issues
as well, your grow style can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not blaming it on you, I'm just saying
that environmental factors and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff plus science and nature will lead to
some screw-ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll take credit for part of those
screw-ups because I'm the one that made
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when this is done right, we get
quality, reliable, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that makes a little bit of
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make the thiosulfate and I spray the
plants with it and magically that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants turn into transsexuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not male plants, they're reversed
females is what we call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that basically is how I am making
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are not hermaphrodite seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not taking hermaphroditic plants and
using hermaphrodite pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing anything crazy ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is reliable science.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that a lot of people are afraid
of feminized seeds is because when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: started there were other less reliable
practices used to make femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma does another method since we talked
about Soma earlier in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma does not use the silver thiosulfate
method as often as I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Soma does is he lets his plants grow
too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if he's got a 10-week flowering plant,
he'll let it grow about 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when a plant goes that long,
it kind of stresses itself and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: herms out and creates pollen that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what Soma is using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard of Soma taking a mature
plant and this sounds completely crazy to
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of growers, but it'll make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes a completely mature plant and
then he will light a small fire and he
[SPEAKER_01]: will put his plant too close to the fire
where the plant panics and the plant feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's a forest fire coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant starts to create male
flowers and it's a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's triggering that survival instinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes those male flowers,
which make pollen and then Soma collects
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen and sprinkles it onto other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this explains why feminized
seeds are so damn expensive because there
[SPEAKER_01]: are more steps into making feminized seeds
than there are to making regular,
[SPEAKER_01]: true breeding male-female seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's hard for me to keep up
because I have to reverse plants and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get as much pollen from reversing
these plants as I do from a normal male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I told you enough about
reversing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should have caught on by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, you're going to have to
experiment with the dilutions and the
[SPEAKER_01]: application rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Ed Rosenthal's book, I don't have it
next to me, The Oakster Dam Course Guide,
[SPEAKER_01]: the most, I'm not even sure that it's the
most current, but Ed Rosenthal wrote in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakster Dam Course Guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that book, there is a recipe to
make your own silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That recipe does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although for some plants, it will need
some adjusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to take a fat dab and take a
drink and try to get this frog out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: throat so that I can sound like an actual
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be right back guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will give some shout outs and wrap
up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to apologize for taking so many
breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: on you this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I have some guests that can cover
me while I'm coughing and taking a drink
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, but today was just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had to bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoyed the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a big old fat dab of some Jack
the Ripper shatter made by my good friends
[SPEAKER_01]: at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked that up at the Green and Healthy
Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't shop at a lot of dispensaries
because I'm self-sufficient, but I was low
[SPEAKER_01]: on shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just between harvest right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to pick up a few grams of
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Green and Healthy Wellness on 212
South 21st Street in Colorado Springs has
[SPEAKER_01]: the hookups on Turpex shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a medical card and you were
in the Colorado Springs area, shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in Pueblo or Denver,
it's worth the hour drive to head to Green
[SPEAKER_01]: and Healthy Cannabis and pick up your
Turpex shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how much it is because
they have member pricing, they have
[SPEAKER_01]: non-member pricing, and they have quite a
few tiers of pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get you pumped up because
sometimes they run out of the low pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But dude, go to Green and Healthy Wellness
in Colorado Springs and get some Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to John and John and Jordan
and Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing like a dispensary with two Johns
and two Jordans in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to give a big shout out to my
friend, Claude the Candy Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Claude, if you're listening to this show,
bro, big thanks, much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, support Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in California, you can get your
Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's available here in
Colorado anymore, but much love,
[SPEAKER_01]: much respect to Claude the Candy Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a big hug to Melissa and a little
scratch on the head to Sticky the Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, big huge shout out to my buddy Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always owe you a big shout out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grimy Gatsby on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are having a growers meeting,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do these growers meetings in the back
of Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse gets a topic started and then I will
jump in and help him give a little grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to talk about... Oh
no, that's old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the topic is this
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should text him and find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to have a meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting is on March 6th at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: at Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grabbing the paper with the address
right now because I don't remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do remember, but I don't want to say it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were invited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were invited.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this podcast,
I think you have to be 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 21 and over event.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to the show and you're
21 and up, you can come to this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: March 6th at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good chance Sean Kingkola will
be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes Smentz shows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Weedon comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a lot of cool people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we give away prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give away prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just help out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But big shout out to Hygro indoor growing
supplies for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I'm going to start coughing
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I have a big coughing fit
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try to wrap up the show
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a short episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys seem to pay more attention when
the episodes are shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly get more listens, more
completed listens to episodes under 45
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might start doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a show idea, message me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear your show ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show came all out of emails that I
received from listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made this show just for you because of
your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to hear something,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel like you're begging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do a show based on what you want to
hear because this show is for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: not me.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to close the show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back in another week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I said that the Dragonfly Earth
medicine people were coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out our schedules kind of missed
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in Washington up near Canada
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may set up a Skype interview,
but I never when podcasts do Skype and
[SPEAKER_01]: phone interviews, I usually don't listen
because it sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless I can get a really quality
recording out of it, I won't do it to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wait for them to come to Colorado and
I will interview them in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hyped you guys up that the Dragonfly
Earth medicine people are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a miscommunication.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are currently in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you heard me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can make it happen through a good
phone interview, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not quality, I will never play it
because I hate it when I hear a crappy
[SPEAKER_01]: phone interview on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to try to get Sean and Jesse
back for a soil recycling episode really
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of cool stuff lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis cup is coming up here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's my birthday right now,
so I got a lot of fun shit happening this
[SPEAKER_01]: week.

I gave him.
