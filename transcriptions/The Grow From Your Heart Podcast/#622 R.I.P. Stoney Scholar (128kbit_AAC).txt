[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be take 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've honestly lost count of takes at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get it right this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 621 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a short episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is definitely not your regularly
scheduled program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very special episode dedicated
to a very special person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the show I wanted to deliver to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the show I wanted to record
today, but this is the show that my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Stony Scholar deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to keep it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may get emotional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to take a couple of breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some weird edits,
but we're gonna get through this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of nights ago, my friend Stony
Scholar, a very integral member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ivory army, a very huge member of the
cannabis community, a very important part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world, was hit and killed by a
drunk driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of mixed emotions about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, fuck, my friend is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got sadness and sorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got a lot of mixed emotions
toward the person who killed my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my spot to judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my spot to deal with that,
but holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is dead and it's somebody else's
fault, so that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person, I'm not gonna cast any
judgment or hate on that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to deal with the fact that
they took out my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to deal with that for the rest
of their living life, but man,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you for killing my friend is how I
honestly feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's husband is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daddy is gone and that shit sucks,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna bitch and complain on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it feels like I've started off
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of emotions going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn this into a special shout out
and a tribute to my friend Stony Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered Stony on the Embracing
Organics podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole EO crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys watch the EO podcast that
we talk about Stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we're gonna talk about him the
whole episode, so check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered Stony Scholar through the
Embracing Organics podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was EO crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was DGC, that is Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also Irie Army before he knew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just had to find us and discover us and
become part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He quickly became Irie Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a fellow grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was Irie Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a pet dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was my fucking friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cool, funny dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was cantankerous and ornery and a
little bit, he liked to push ya,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was a little bit provocative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my favorite kind of fucking
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was cantankerous is one of the words I
like to use for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had a good time talking to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did troll him a little bit, but that was
the relationship that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trolled each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We poked each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to encourage each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm trolling you and poking you,
it's a gentle way of showing you that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a better way I'm encouraging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just enlightening each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how bros and guys do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it to the ladies, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had kind of a troll-y relationship
with each other and it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hope he knows that I had nothing
but love and respect and that our friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: bickering was nothing but two old guys
friendly arguing bickering as two old
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stoney, I hope you always took me with
a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you always knew I was giving you my
bullshit with tongue-in-cheek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had nothing but love, still got nothing
but love and respect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Stoney Scholar, I think I'm still in
shock and pissed off and angry that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doing this podcast is helping me and
my boy deserves this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoney was a generous fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this pipe I've been smoking out
of on recent live shows and recent
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes was a gift to my buddy Stoney.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you how I discovered him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you how I actually met Stoney
Scholar in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grows concentration celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't remember which one it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the dude grows event at the,
what was the place used to be called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that what it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy up there in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grows with throw parties there,
events there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Stoney Scholar came there and actually
hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came with Stabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came with the whole EO crew and met me,
hung out at my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually stored his backpack behind the
iReGenetics booth the whole night because
[SPEAKER_00]: he had so much shit with him because he
was on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought me this pipe, gave me this pipe
as a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to smoke some of his
concentrates, he'd hand you the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say take as big of a fucking dab you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to smoke his flower,
he'd say pick the bud you want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude was super generous, super kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had funny laughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were grouchy old men together that
laughed at grouchy old men shit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good to, honestly you guys,
this is therapy for me and I owe this to
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend Stoney.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna hit this bowl, think about my
buddy Stoney, then we'll continue in a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure that we'd give
him a shout out for being a generous dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: being a cantankerous dude, always an
honest dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never, to me, he never seemed
dishonest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was too cantankerous and ornery to tell
a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd rather tell you the dirty truth with
his tongue in his cheek and look at you
[SPEAKER_00]: sideways and be like actually you look
like a fucking idiot in that shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would never tell you you look good in
something he didn't look good in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his style and I appreciate that
in people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of friends I like to have
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hit a bowl, take a very brief
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do a fucking hour of silence for
my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna hit a bowl, have a brief
moment, think about your friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: think about the people that are around
you, the people you don't see often
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, the people you see too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the folks you love,
the people you're gonna miss when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna think about my buddy Stoney
Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knew Stoney, think about him while
I hit this bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe hit a bowl with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't know him, send a vibe up to
him or think about the people that you
[SPEAKER_00]: miss or that you don't want to miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's celebrate Stoney Scholar with a puff
off of this bowl together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moment of silence and a rip for my buddy
Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it together you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that Stoney Scholar
showed up to the event with the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: e-nail and a rig ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plugged it into my booth and just started
taking dabs at my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is like my workspace,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have to make some room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, sure, I'll just put it
behind your booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody ended up behind my booth
dabbing and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great little home base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good time hanging out with
Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bullshit that I'm never gonna get to
do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give him compliments and praises.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave each other a lot of shit,
but it was to drive each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come on here and I seem like I am the
cannabis guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one spreading the knowledge and
sharing things with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoney taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get it twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoney never failed to teach me something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had new ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had completely different thought
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think in a completely different way,
which I enjoy and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kind of friends I like to be
surrounded by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a bunch of friends that all
love reggae and fish and all wanna grow
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and do all the same exact shit,
or we end up doing the same exact shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that he was different than me,
that he was a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if I just keep going,
I'm rambling and this will get emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing left to do but take a
big fat dab and just give a big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here, fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoney Scholar, that's for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to come on here and make sure to
show you some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You deserved a full episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short one, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in no condition to record a long
podcast about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for paying tribute to my buddy,
Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for supporting the podcast and
for being my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of people sending me shout
outs saying, hey, I heard we lost a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, I'm mad that my friend
is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mad that I don't get to troll him,
talk shit to him, get his advice,
[SPEAKER_00]: give him advice, have that dude around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm angry that somebody recklessly and
irresponsibly killed my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's complete bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not my place to judge or punish that
person, so I'm going to do my best to
[SPEAKER_00]: forgive them in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take some time, to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly how to let go of the
feeling of you killed my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: so fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to deal with it the best I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a big crew that does support
each other, but we're going to need some
[SPEAKER_00]: love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire Embracing Organics family lost
a huge team member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoney was working on some projects that
lost a huge team member, so I am okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send those love and hugs to the EO
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at EO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off on that podcast just being a
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invited me to be a guest,
and then they said, hey, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are now a panel member.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang out any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, now it's the EO family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We check on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send each other messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always saying, what's up,
making sure everybody's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get funny messages from some of those
guys in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby will message me at fucking three in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirtman Dan hits me up around five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's in different time zones,
so it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave and I talk a lot more than you guys
would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've become the Embracing Organics
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, sometimes there are rifts in the
force and groups have bickering and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, but hopefully something like this
will show a lot of the younger kids that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to put the bullshit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to love one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to respect each other,
not just in each group, but in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and the world overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys love the people you could love,
love the people that are around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be there forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're focused on the gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focused on business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focused on moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's COVID time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what we're focused on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget to focus on love and
friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a minute to thank your friends for
being your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a minute to enjoy your friends while
they're your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old ones, the young ones in these
weird times, anybody can go away at any
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a drunk driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be heart disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be so many things in this world
that could take you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's appreciate the people that are
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spend some time with those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put down the iPhones, put down the iPads,
spend some eye to eye contact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat up a dab nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a fat dab in honor of my
buddy Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm just going to let the credits
roll by or something like that while I
[SPEAKER_00]: take this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll play some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make the video too long
and redundant and obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I want to send a giant
shout out to my buddy Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did leave behind a wife who is now,
she does not have a husband who I can only
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine what it would be like to lose your
partner in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the income is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the income.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the stability, the emotional support
that person's been there next to you every
[SPEAKER_00]: waking hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a huge adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure that there will be some sort of
fundraising for Mrs. Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep her on her feet
emotionally, physically, financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that there's rent
paid, some food in the refrigerator,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that she's got the best smile that she
could possibly get while her husband is
[SPEAKER_00]: gone and she's adjusting to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be funeral costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I do know those details,
I'll either post them in the show notes,
[SPEAKER_00]: video description, or I will share them on
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to ask you guys to help my
friend Stoney and trust me, I will make a
[SPEAKER_00]: generous contribution to help out Stoney
Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoney Scholar as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to take care of the family,
take care of the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, this dab nail is
quite hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for me to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to miss you, miss talking shit
to you, miss getting shit talked back to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump, big hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you one day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
