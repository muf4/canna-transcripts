[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go, Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am ready, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Podcast World, and it's time
for episode 479 of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you just heard, my buddy Clint is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hanging out, getting stoned as shit
doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to try to talk you into doing
a dab, but I think I would rather have you
[SPEAKER_01]: coherent for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be my first and last.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Clint is not a dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoking some flowers over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure am.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you smoking, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, I actually got my hands on
some... Well, the strain I got told,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was AK-47.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Classics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I got told.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what I took a puff off of
yesterday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was floral and fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fortunately, I got a clean pipe right
now, so everything tastes a lot better
[SPEAKER_02]: through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a nice, fresh, clean pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: My rig needs a cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: My concentrate probably would taste better
had I cleaned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good job on the clean pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you grow that herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: That herb is actually a close friend grew
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they did a very good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compliments to the chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely let them know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass that on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to start the podcast off by
talking about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually talk about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am smoking something that I think
tastes quite divine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Peach Wrecker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the full spectrum extract and
I've also got the live batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peach Wrecker, full spectrum extract and
live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a blend of Day Wrecker and Peach
Oz on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor is described as peach,
honey and gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I open it, the first thing you get is
peach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is like a fuzzy navel, the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you hit it, that peach flavor
hits you first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like a white grape peach thing,
like a generic peach juice, a fake peach
[SPEAKER_01]: juice you'd get at the grocery store in a
carton.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that peach juice flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not dissing the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that's the version of
peach that I get from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the exhale, the honey comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the honey on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets sweet and soft on my tongue and
that honey comes in on the exhale and it
[SPEAKER_01]: just chills there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really digging that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gas is there but not as much as the
peach and the honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a little glob of the live batter
and got enough of that on the dabber to
[SPEAKER_01]: work as a little bit of a paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I stuck a giant full spectrum extract
diamond into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I dipped that into a little bit of
the terp sauce in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's got me fucking talkative
and rambly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're doing tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, you make me want to do dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, not tonight, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of the show, we might get him
to do a dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always putting them over,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always sound so delicious coming out
of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell these any time you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reach over and smell any of these
delicious concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a table covered in ... Yeah,
that's a good one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big jar there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll see what I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got an insufficient nose, though,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: An untrained nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll bet it's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the non connoisseur, I like this naked
nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at all the ... Am I allowed to
say what I'm looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all these crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a four gram jar of Mai Tai full
spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's untouched.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's four grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say it looks like golden caviar,
basically?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's giving it a sniff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe it at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: That smells like right when the plants get
into flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right near the end, right before you're
going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you give them that squeeze and it's
real floral still, that's what I smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because it's made from ... I'm
pretty sure that that one comes from fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be more of just ... I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you give it a smell and then maybe we
can compare on what we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a hint of grandpa's aftershave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fun game to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, do you smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do the thing that we do to
clerks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do on the movie, Clerks, where I'm
like, hey, does this smell like ass to
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that ready to rumble when he has
his finger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember that movie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting into the weeds on some
movies all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back into the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we were smelling is Mai Tai.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blend of Sunset Sherbet and
Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put Sherbert on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be ... I don't know if that R
goes in there or not, but they can write
[SPEAKER_01]: it their way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Purple Punch, it's called Tropical
Fruit Cocktail is what they describe it
[SPEAKER_01]: as.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Tropical Fruit Cocktail in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropical Fruit Cocktail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a hint of that cologne-y
sort of a smell that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like some brute old spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue one, it's blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever comes in the old blue bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old guy aftershave in a blue bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get some emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be great.
Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already like six minutes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't talked about ganja at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I opened another one real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one has a huge crystal in it,
so that's pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I already know what that is because of
the huge crystal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Headbanger, so Headbanger and HSB,
so jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, then that's the garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got the garlic banger over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got the garlic banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get trash can?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just... Smell like mashed potatoes and
trash can?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the trash can for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a terrible description,
but when you smell a cannabis that smells
[SPEAKER_01]: and concentrates, that smell like a trash
can, for some reason, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so weird what I'm attracted to when
I'm looking for weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the nose knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done a podcast called Follow Your
Nose because I feel like your nose knows
[SPEAKER_01]: what your body needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this, and this is going to be a
really random question, is there almost a
[SPEAKER_01]: sexual aroma to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something that would almost trigger a
sexual pheromone in that smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that earthy, almost kind of an armpit-y,
summer-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean like summer by the... I
mean like somebody in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like Sex Panther.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Clint is a part-time comedian,
so Sex Panther is going to be the answer
[SPEAKER_01]: we go with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a funk to it,
like a body odor sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I really think that one smells
fucking grossly good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty tight, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and the stuff that you got in front
of you is just the most beautiful crystals
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How pretty these things are coming out is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say thank you, but all I did was
hand money over for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all of our friends at Green Dot
Labs doing this good work here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm putting them over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's move on because we're going to
make people frustrated with the plethora
[SPEAKER_01]: and buffet of concentrates we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people listening in places that
they don't have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't need to rub it into their
faces that we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thing we cut most of that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something called doses and mimosas sitting
here on the table that looks like magic
[SPEAKER_01]: and some Mai Tai.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to know about all that
stuff we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint, I like the look on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the F are we in this podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're smoking on, I just hit the
peach record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint is smoking AK-47.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stoned, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's level out and get this going,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the point in the show where we
give shout-outs to our friends who support
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Patreon, I'd like to start off with a

[SPEAKER_01]: having a lot of fun, so who knows if we
will even get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what we got to do last
night, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, real quick, dude, those hoodies are
tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those hoodies smooth looking or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and bright on the front, nice and
warm.

iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the website doesn't look very

[SPEAKER_01]: Support, that's the bottom line there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for all the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that without the ire army,
without the grow from your heart crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: that this wouldn't be a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join the club, boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys listen to the show
frequently, and even if you don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll learn right now, I am a huge fan of
comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think laughter is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke cannabis and get told a joke,
and you'll forget you even got problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just be too busy laughing and it
feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It recharges your soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you got to deal with your
problems appropriately, but sometimes you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to just, it helps the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to deal with your problems in your
mind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear that through the microphone?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I tapped my head, it came through my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hollow.
That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What note do I play?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find out later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think laughter is good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think it's good to take your
friends to go see fucking laughter also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to go see, we got to go see the
fine gentleman of who's live anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the live version of whose line is
it anyway from TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure a lot of people know what that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on CW is what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been on for years on different
channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not the tall guy, not the black guy
and not Drew Carey is one of the jokes
[SPEAKER_01]: they tell you a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was Mr. Greg Proops, who if you
listen, you know, that's one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was so funny last night too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of works as a very gracious host
of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got very good hosting skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a comedian known as Jeff B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davis, a younger guy who fits in very well
with the improv group.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brings a lot of energy and creativity
and movement to the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really worked hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got to bring that younger energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying the other guys are old
cats, but they're not spring chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're older dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to have Jeff B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davis bring that young energy is really a
good thing for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To some really like experienced improv
guys was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a guy named Joel Murray,
who is really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a lot of great voices,
a lot of good character, a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: good, slightly dry humor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of has a Bob Newhart sort of a
delivery to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really played like the dad almost on
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the smart ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it got too funny, he'd have one
comment just to shut you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't say a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just what he said was correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's another guy that some people
may have heard of, a guy named,
[SPEAKER_01]: his name is Dave Foley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave Foley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave Foley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's got a lot of character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snazzy dresser.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all pretty well dressed last
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of Greg Proops's themes is how
do we dress as sharp as possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of his mottos all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they of course look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be rude to overlook a very
crucial member of the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a musician whose name,
who has escaped my head right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he brings a grand piano and a keyboard
and a couple of other small instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he provides the musical soundtrack for
the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without him, it wouldn't be a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do improv songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He provides background music and sound
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: People often forget about that guy in the
back making the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs a special acknowledgement because
he's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an amazing talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing an improv show and the
audience member is yelling out steps to
[SPEAKER_01]: the improv.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, the improv guys, and I'm not
downplaying them, they've got to do
[SPEAKER_01]: improv.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to make it funny physically
and virtually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's got to make it funny musically.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to take your idea and make music
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got to give it like a contremont.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, look at you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bringing out big words for the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like a company man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just like pushing it ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he just, he made the show,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing the score and the sound effects
at the same time, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember they said he was from Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's won a bunch of awards for something,
a big thing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to be disrespectful like that,
but he's definitely well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I was plenty stoned because we
were going to a funny comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing I was thinking about
was remembering people's names,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he deserves some acknowledgement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great fucking musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Who's Live Anyway tour is coming to
your neighborhood, I highly recommend you
[SPEAKER_01]: highly go and go highly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely get baked and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big shout out to Jeff B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big shout out to Joel Murray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, a giant shout out to Mr. Dave
Foley.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shout out to the musician guy who,
man, I feel rude for not remembering his
[SPEAKER_01]: name, but he was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second City in Toronto is where he's
famous from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That word just popped into my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to send a big shout out to our
friend, Greg Proops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we've met Proops a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proops interacts with myself on Twitter
quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls me Young Dabber is the name he
has assigned to me, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the dab fits, I'll hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we may or may not have known exactly
where Proops was going to be moments after
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may or may not have approached him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was completely kind to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thanked us for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to shake Proops' hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like we're on a friendly basis
with Proops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool to go see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is very gracious when he sees us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's such a polite man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you shake your hand and just be polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, what a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're kissing his ass a little bit,
but I just enjoyed the show a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like so fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep telling everybody, I took Clint to
a comedy show and we had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give you a shout out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, hey, bro, you want to dab
tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I got to record.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, wait, I know what to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put a microphone in front of Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, man, thanks for being a fucking
awesome road dog on the comedy show thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun with you every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, we've had some really good times
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vernon Schaub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called him Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brennan Schaub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy Buns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Segura.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we saw Who's Alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done quite a few cool comedy shows
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to see Derek Poston.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asan Ahmad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying his name wrong, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying, well, he put a J in his name
and Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was saying the J, but that's like
his middle name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Asan Ahmad, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was calling him Asanj just because
that's what it says on fucking Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to shout people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that looked him up on Instagram
found him because of the way it had
[SPEAKER_01]: pronounced it because they put the J in
there because I was saying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they did because that guy's
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's fucking funny and he's blowing up
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Derek Poston.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unexpected and very, very worth my
ticket price.
[SPEAKER_01]: He blew the roof off the place,
blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad I got to see him because now
I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then got to meet him after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you're fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just humble and want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were just so chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I don't know about all these
comedians that have come through have just
[SPEAKER_02]: been so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, we meet shop,
we meet proofs again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like we've hung out with proofs for
like an hour, you know, probably between
[SPEAKER_02]: the times we've seen him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's telling this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proofs is like holding court and telling
the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just me and Jeff and like two
other people hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gaia was there and that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we're just like, we're just all
just chilling and it's like just this real
[SPEAKER_02]: secluded little area that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, he's telling this story and it's
something about baseball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden Jeff gets hit across
the chest, like, like a Ric Flair chop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tagged me that I was out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story about, cause anybody that
knows Proofs knows he's a baseball fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves baseball stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got him lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's telling a story about baseball and he
tagged me to express that the runner was
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, he just, I looked at
Clint like proofs just slapped the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost had to step in like security
guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew that I was loving it because we
were out there smoking them out and
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd been hanging out with him for like
45 minutes by that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's always been such a gentleman
and such a great host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a great thing about that
comedian personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, a need for attention and the
thing that once you've got an audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to let it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we find them at the right time
and they're still in that pocket,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just keep going for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they see us and that club knows
who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I may be given special treatment
and get special access to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once they meet us and they calm down
and they start smoking, they realize these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are harmless.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not like sketchy fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to ask us to sign their
ass cheeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even asking for pictures and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hung out with Doug eight times
recently and there's no photos anywhere of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because there's no need for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you get to a certain like mentality
and you just realize like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, I'm enjoying this for this moment
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it happened and Doug knows it
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of got out there when we meet
these people, once you get them going,
[SPEAKER_01]: you smoke a bowl with them or two,
and then you don't get weird on them and
[SPEAKER_01]: they get comfortable with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're at a comedy club and they're
safe zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the comedy club has kind of confirmed
that we're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been given the, Hey, those guys are
all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They chill out and they give you,
they can't stop doing the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're still in a spotlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still waiting to be told the show,
the other show is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the show that they're just
performing in life today, because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, just that personality type has a
need for attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the comedians, all their lives,
they're just trying to get someone to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are, they're like, Oh,
I'll talk until you're fucking done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hanging out with Joey Diaz for that
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to hang out with him and him giving
me comedy advice back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those were just like ingrained.
[SPEAKER_02]: In me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cause I'm such a fan boy, you know,
so it's, it's some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's just exciting to like kind
of meet your heroes and they like are
[SPEAKER_02]: tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, to watch Joey talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually, I'm the mouthy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I'm the one that can just walk
my way into a situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not shy to walk up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not going to shoot me,
I could walk up to the president casually
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Rasta Jeff and stick out my hand and
shake, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if you're the president.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if you're the janitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll walk up and talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll share a joint, no matter who you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm usually the one that's like kind of
dominating the conversation sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: purposely, sometimes not to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go to meet these famous people,
I know how to be comfortable and make a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation happen and be casual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you generally stand a little bit to
the back and let the conversation go and
[SPEAKER_01]: you talk when it's necessary and let me
run my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey decided, you said, I'm a standup
comedian and Joey was like, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck this guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I was like me step back into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just stood back and let you and I
watched you and Joey Diaz have a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a light right between you guys
just shining on both of your faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just stood back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a health stone pipe with hash in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just sat there and hit a bowl a
couple of times and just chilled out and
[SPEAKER_01]: watch Joey tell you he laid it down,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember what he told you right every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, I don't care what you write
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if you write your name across
the page a thousand times, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spend an hour writing every fucking
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was fucking, I think that's part of
the, part of the key, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: just to get those magical moments and to
watch him tell you that and just to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: back was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I would have had the balls to take
out my phone and snap a shot for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's all good, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it in our memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have made it uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have broken all of the magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the phone would have ruined all of
the magic at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like we kind of just had like a,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like almost a social like barrier
where it's just like, dude, we're just
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of why they let us do
that, bro, because we don't ever fanboy
[SPEAKER_01]: out and pull out our dicks or our phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just let us go.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're just trying to hand them weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Hey man, let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell them my secret that every
comedian that comes through who gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: get fucking stoned with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's well when comedians do what they
do, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have fun in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I've got listed here on my
paper is the Endo Expo is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have been asking,
when is the next big event?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Endo Expo, January 25th and 26th in
Denver, Colorado with the Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 25th is industry day, which means
you've got to get an industry invite pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 26th is general public day,
which means you are able to attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the Endo Expo website,
this is for the Denver Endo Expo that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be at the Denver Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to come to the booth,
come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come tell me if you love or hate the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe pick up some cool iRegenetics
merchandise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just come say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check out the Endo Expo in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me warn you, that is a non-consumption
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot consume any sort of cannabis or
buy or sell or trade cannabis in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a cannabis trade show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the world's largest indoor
cannabis trade shows, indoor grow based
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis trade shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an entire CBD and hemp indoor
pavilion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it the indoor hemp pavilion,
where they've got a bunch of CBD vendors
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching about CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually do give away CBD samples
because it's anything without THC they can
[SPEAKER_01]: give away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can share with you, but nothing with
THC they can share or give away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just dispensary and Colorado state
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can check out all kinds of
nutrient companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out lighting companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be tons of seed companies there
if you need to refill your genetic status.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Endo Expo is a great opportunity for
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can meet the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you plan properly and you do it
properly, bring a bag and you can fill
[SPEAKER_01]: that bag with excellent freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get shirts, stickers, hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a fresh outfit for the entire
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to rock out like whatever
company you like, probably a iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could get a new Millennium
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can get a Veg Bloom t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go visit all your favorite vendors,
talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are giving out free merchandise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge free commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to invite people to come
hang out at the iRe booth and say what's
[SPEAKER_01]: up to iRegenetics at the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a huge event too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge event.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to start getting tickets now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome that you're in that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to finally have stepped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, I shared a booth with other
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was invited to be part of the Organ
Elite Seeds team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense to them, but the Endo Expo
reached out and they said, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a local.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a Colorado boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love having the hometown heroes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to have a booth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, hell yes, I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid the normal price for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say they gave me any
special deal, but they reached out and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, we went to Colorado, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, fuck yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a full 10 by 10 booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the booth ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a lot of great things
available at the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's my commercial for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks at
the iRegenetics booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get White Mike to be able to
attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does have two children and a family and
a lot of things going on that time of
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 25th and 26th of January, Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a little more serious because in
a previous episode, I may have said
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was not a hundred percent
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a huge mistake, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I don't like making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like learning from my mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that I've got a really good
community, the iRe Army, the Grow From
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Heart crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only did they support us well on
Patreon, but also they reached out and
[SPEAKER_01]: politely said, Hey, you gave some kind of
funky information on one of these episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: and it wasn't a major mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to kill anybody's plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I will admit that this is the
area of growing and cannabis where I can
[SPEAKER_01]: use the most education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not afraid to admit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot about most of this is
lighting and light spectrums, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I know very minimal about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should know more and I'm not ashamed to
admit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know about plants like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know about breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know about selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look at your plants and tell you
what's wrong with their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can tell you a lot of things when
it comes to lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a little ignorant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to read more books on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not shy to admit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily I said something that
indicated straight up, I'm fucking full of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit when it comes to talking about
lighting, because some of our friends
[SPEAKER_01]: stepped up and said, Rasta Jeff,
first off, you're a little bit wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they helped me out and they said,
here's the information that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to all of my friends who
helped me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I start reading this, one of our
friends will say, ha ha, he took my
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a previous episode, I kind of said
that the sun changes color as it sets and
[SPEAKER_01]: that color from the sun creates a
different spectrum that helps the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun does not change colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly hadn't done, I didn't write any
notes for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reading that question and was just
answering it from my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said that the sun changes colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may look like it changes colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The atmosphere filters the light based on
the angle of the sun in a comparison to
[SPEAKER_01]: where we are seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't change colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a filter because imagine if
you held a light bulb right above your
[SPEAKER_01]: head, you're going to see bright here and
you're going to get that other color of
[SPEAKER_01]: light down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you move it and the light's going
to shine differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's foggy, the fucking light shines
differently because you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the type of shit that's going to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I completely, obviously you can tell I
don't understand that concept fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell by the way I'm trying to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, different spectrums of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that happens because of the angle of
the sun where you are and the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It filters the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to say I did that wrong
and I am not afraid to admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you to my friend, Jesse James,
for stepping up and correcting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me that I've got a
team that will politely say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro, you sound dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't give out fake information.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're willing to fucking make your
mistakes and learn from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a podcast all about making
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you guys, I'm not fucking
bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said some dumb shit and here I am saying
I said some dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people rely on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you were close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a plant thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more of a... And so we were
talking about far red spectrums and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a spectrum that falls in the seven to
800 nanometer range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a little bit of a debate on
the internet on what range is ideal for
[SPEAKER_01]: the far red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say it is seven to 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw 730 to 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more specifically, people dial it
into the 750 to 780 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also seen people go up to 830.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little bit of a debate where
that red happens, which is most ideal for
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like all lighting pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably possibly phenotype
dependent, plant specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bet it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, where plants are from,
they're going to want different light,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern, southern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be... All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes a big difference as to where
your nanometers are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I corrected that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Jesse James for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize for kind of leading you
guys astray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here I am, addressing my mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I said that I would not recommend
cutting clones directly into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a listener saying that they were
taking their clones into cocoa and their
[SPEAKER_01]: clones were dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, that's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got several messages saying,
basically go fuck yourself because I cut
[SPEAKER_01]: clones into cocoa when it works.
Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course somebody is going to tell you
they can do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I believe you and I'm sure that it
does work for you, but for the listener
[SPEAKER_01]: who they were all dying on, it obviously
wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommended they go back to basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those people that it's working for,
that's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably got a lot of experience
and you know really well what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've dialed it in and you're not killing
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a listener killing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's not working, that's when I
start going backwards and start saying
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on, what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the engine doesn't work, you got to
take it apart and rebuild that bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just trying to take it apart and
start going back to the white belt level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll work our way back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe when they're good again,
they understand the basics of cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get them going back into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for that person, it wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't say that, no, you cannot clone
into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably not the thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not recommended for
beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're having problems doing it,
abandon that because you'll have much more
[SPEAKER_01]: success with the cloning machine or
probably easy cloner, not easy cloner,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rapid router little plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can clone into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if I upset you by dissing your
tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work, but not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, people are just coming at me and I
need to be the corrections department.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, enough catching up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: The next part is, oh, I got a really good
question on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one was a question about how do
you feel about 11-13 light schedules?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought I could talk briefly
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: An 11-13 flowering schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us do a 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be the traditional on-off
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12-12 makes your plants flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You leave them there for nine or 10 weeks
and you get good buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Short a while back started preaching
about doing... DJ Short is the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: made it popular for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Short started talking about doing 11
hours on and 13 hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has several benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first benefit is it will show more
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing from seed, you'll see
more variation in your different
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see different phenotypical
expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: More expression, I guess I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll show their variances a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just getting less light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less light.
[SPEAKER_01]: More time to express, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: More time to show what they... They say
that kids grow when they're asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the plants do the same thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They start to... If you watch a video of a
plant on a time lapse camera, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: do a lot during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get blown around and they try to stay
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: At night, they look like they're swimming
and they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves go up and the leaves go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves go up and they go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you move a jack, you move the
handle down and the jack goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it looks like the leaves are
kind of swimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up like a jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch them overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really neat to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really neat to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do most of their growth,
most of their production at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned that if you give them
that longer extended night period,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do see a little bit different
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also, in my opinion, speed them up
in their flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may save up to a week, maybe 10 days
on some phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a 70 dayer and you cut it
down to 11, 13, you may have a 65 dayer at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be plant and phenotype
dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But get your scope out and start paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may notice different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this, get them brown, that sounds
grosser than it should.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be plant and strain and
phenotype dependent on if this is best for
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want, if you're running from seed
in a small tent and you're just doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunt, I would go with the 11,
13.
[SPEAKER_01]: This also has advantages in a large scale
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you've got 24 lights and I cut
off one hour a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a month, you've got 30 days at 24
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 700 120 hours of lighting that
you're not paying for, which is also air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning you're not paying for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those bulbs are also going to last you
that hour longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just multiplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got, if you're running 24,
what are, I don't even know the numbers I
[SPEAKER_01]: started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at 24 lights, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we said 24 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just scales up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go more lights, you're saving more
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even just one hour, but is that pushing
it, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just depends on the strain,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, uh, if you're doing a
phenohunt, I would recommend it like to
[SPEAKER_01]: start off with that just to find the one
that, cause it's going to show you the,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're able to express their phenotypes
more, uh, more fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how else to say those words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tall ones are going to get taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple ones will show more purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stinky one will get stinkier in my
opinion, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may, uh, do a little bit to your
yields because we do say that light is the
[SPEAKER_01]: number one source of energy and food for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're cutting down an hour of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that may show a small reduction in
yield and in harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen a big difference in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not big enough to make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would rather do the 1113.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm really going to throw the world
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint, I'm going to imagine that several
people signed out of this episode because
[SPEAKER_01]: we were a little bit rambly at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't think they were going to get
this magical fucking grow tip,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a tip that I don't share with a lot
of people that I don't talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something, this is an advanced
tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of flowering, I change my
timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to preach for people to reduce
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that takes way too
long to flower, here's, here's one piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of advice and I'll share what I was going
to say after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that takes too long
to flower, I'm going to use lemon G as my
[SPEAKER_01]: example, because this works very well with
lemon G.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing lemon G or a lemon G
cross, take note.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a cultivar that takes 11,
12, 13 weeks, this will work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plant takes too long, you need it
to hurry up, you're running 12,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12, or you're running 11, 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toward the end of flower, you can reduce
the amount of light hours and that will
[SPEAKER_01]: make that plant speed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does the same thing that happens
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the plant go, oh shit,
fall's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hurry up and do my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts finishing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can do all that processing at
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts finishing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts speeding up that finishing
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts hardening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichomes start ripening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can slowly reduce the amount of
daylight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get down to eight hours a day if
you want to and just have eight hours on
[SPEAKER_01]: and 16 hours off and let the plant finish
like that for the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite often during flush, I'll reduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I've got something lemon G,
I'll reduce the lights to 10 hours on for
[SPEAKER_01]: a week and then I'll move them to eight
hours on for a week and for the last week,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them on for six hours on and that
plant will really finish up and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing through that time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saving a lot of money on less lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really an economical way to help that
plant finish up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can reduce the amount of daylight
hours to finish up a slower finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would temperature in the room do anything
for that too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like would dropping the temperature make
things speed up a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit colder will help you,
but you can't have too large of a swing
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's when you start promoting
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you overall lower your daytime and
nighttime temperature slowly and keep your
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor pressure deficit in line,
that is something that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll bring out purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll bring out density and that'll also
bring out some flavors and some colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about outside when it starts getting
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start seeing those beautiful fall
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll happen indoors with the
temperature and this light adjustment as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing the 11-13 and then you
start dropping the lights down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really going to see that fall
change in your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you get some really cool photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the photos come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you share some rad stuff on your
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got some good friends growing some
good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like I have refrained from posting
a lot of my own photos because if the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder can breed a strain and grow it to
perfection, good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: High five.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can breed seeds and get them to a
friend who grows in a completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: style than me and they can grow them to
perfection and snapshots of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when you know, you've got a winning
seed and a winning plant right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the breeder can do it, that's expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking required.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like if Metallica plays inner
Sandman, they better get it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we went up there and played inner
Sandman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, who knows how that's going to fucking
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I better get it fucking right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes well, it's like,
oh, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I want to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I want people to see is that
they can do this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been sharing a lot of other
people's and man, thanks for noticing that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been doing a really good job for
me lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you got some good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some people out there running
testers of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even know what it is and they
are killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want them to treat the
plant in any specific way because,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it's got this in it or it's this,
or I suspect it's this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just say, this is some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to worry about boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, how easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if you run into any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take good pictures, document the shit and
they don't know what they've got and they
[SPEAKER_02]: send stellar photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job to my testers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got such amazing, I mean,
you've got a real grip of like products
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a whole line now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, I don't want to, I don't even
want to brag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it just depends on when you catch
me, how much packaging time I've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I've had time to sit here and just
stuff seeds into packages and like find
[SPEAKER_01]: the right seeds for the right packages and
count them out and get them going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of lines available,
but sometimes I don't have time to package
[SPEAKER_01]: them all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at, there's a grip of lemon
Jeffrey seeds sitting over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a few packs of lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those may or may not be for an expo that
might be coming up in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to start packing up early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to have you know, there might
be a limited supply of those stashed for
[SPEAKER_01]: Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to this lighting thing
because we teased the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have cut out once already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I teased that we were going to
give them a secret tip that I don't share
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we talked about other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you kept that tease going for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is something I don't teach a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really advanced trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to scare the shit out of a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad that this came at the end
of this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a golden nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like, this is the prize at the
bottom of the fucking cereal that your
[SPEAKER_01]: parents will let you dig for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to eat the cereal before you get
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the prize, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I find very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I run a 12-12 or an 11-13 light cycle
toward the end of flower, basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: day I begin flushing, this is probably 10
days before I harvest the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will put my timer back on an 18-6 light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will repeat that at the very end of
my flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I return my timer to an 18-6 light cycle
to where my flowering plants receive 18
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of daylight per day and six hours of
night cycle per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, people are going, what the fuck are
you doing, Ross, to Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I see Clint kind of stroking his
beard and going, you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of splaining to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to throw them back in to get them
growing again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes them grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes them beef up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are going to say, well,
won't that make your plants herm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that going to cause problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 10 days or two weeks and we're
flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You flip the light back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said earlier that light is the number
one source of food and energy for our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's beef it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will actually make those buds swell up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times a good cultivar will beef
up on the last couple of weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if that beefy bitch gets extra
energy at that last 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the sun would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really swell up on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are going to go, but they're
going to revege or they're going to herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you've only got 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they do herm, then you might get a
nanner, but nothing's going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: because that nanner will be sterile and
there's no time for anything to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it does drop pollen, there are no
viable parts of the plant that can receive
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are way past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant is basically, it's one of the
golden girls now, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to get pregnant on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way too late for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is done at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's working on its end phases of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to toss any pollen and it's
just going to beef up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may begin to revege if you let it
go for too long, but that's going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: you 14, 15, 17 days before you see any
signs of revege.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll know what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're familiar with your cultivar,
it'll look like it just kind of foxtailed
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something you can try if you
want to add a little bit of beef,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like you lost a little bit of
beef because you did the 11-13 at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last seven days, throw them
fuckers back on 11-13.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I would recommend
experimenting with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't start right away by doing it for 10
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe do it for five days and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next crop, do it for 10 days and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then maybe extend it up to 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go past 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have made other recommendations for
other light cycles that is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: around my breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know other things and other methods
and other schedules that I do when
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may talk about that in a future
episode, but if you want to get crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to try something new,
turn those lights back on to 18 hours on
[SPEAKER_01]: and six hours off at the end of your
flowering cycle as you flush your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if they bulk up and beef up more
than they have in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a golden nugget right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they listen to that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we'll get a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what the emails say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a YouTube comment is where it
will happen first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shout out to all of our friends
who listened to the show on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and subscribe, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint said it for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Clint, we've been going for almost 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we did it, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: High five.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a good time, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, while I've got you here on the
microphone, do you have anything that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would like to say to the world or anything
you'd like to plug?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do not have anything that I'm
doing lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sort of an anonymous kind of a
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like dad at dad.com lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what it is, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people out there aren't dads at
dad.com that they should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out that you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just happy to be able to come
and hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully the podcast world is having a
good time with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure they were excited to hear your
voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bro, you went 45 minutes without
crashing the fucking show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready to do something stupid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't I supposed to do a dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping that you're going to catch my
hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being an awesome guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being a good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being a cool comedy buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just thanks for being a good friend,
man.

give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give your mama a hug for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby, let your rain come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby, let your rain come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby, let your rain come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down, down, down, down, down, down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every now and then when again I'm without
you, I find that my mind's steady thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that you move, the way that
you groove your body, slowly, softly,
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get off me when I'm near.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm not, I feel I got to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a player.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell you done to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at me with my hand behind my
back, ringing your doorbell, wondering if
[SPEAKER_00]: you like how we're looking black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I finally see you, I'm blessed
with your grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: With roses in my hands, two lips on my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a hug, I'd wait a minute for a kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd wait an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But making me wait will just increase my
force and power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I finally see you, I'ma love you
all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lick your belly button and massage your
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my baby buddy, I'll even be your
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I go, thinking about you again.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like strawberries, raspberry, peaches,
and creams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you've been sent from
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you are my baby, my angel,
my love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: April rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your rain come down on me.
I'll come back tomorrow.
