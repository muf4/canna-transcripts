[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, today was the day
after the Dude Grows Cup, and I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hear it in my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a shit ton, a metric shit ton of
dabs last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked a bunch of good flowers,
smoked a bunch of good shatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: met a whole bunch of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody I hung out with at
the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a super huge shout out to the Dude,
and Scotty Real, and Miss Real,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody that took good care of us at
the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure you've heard me talk about it
a little bit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn this music down a little
bit and we'll get into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys, at the Dude Grows Show?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another podcast called the Dude
Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super good podcast hosted by the Dude,
accompanied by a dude that calls himself
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both really cool guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with them last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent a little bit of time with Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to take a super cool photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that photo turned out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they threw a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw a cannabis judging event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't call it a cannabis cup because
that word is already taken, but they threw
[SPEAKER_00]: an event where people were ... They
entered their flowers and their extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: and people got to judge them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the judging process in
just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they threw a really cool event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were quite a few people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event was at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place was ... It wasn't crowded,
but it was comfortably packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just enough people there to make
it a good party, and it wasn't too
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmed where you're bumping in
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of seating, plenty of
tables for us to chill and take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they threw a huge event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw a cool ass party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to taste some of the entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to taste some of the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to meet a whole bunch of cool
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and Lindsey were supposed to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Davin Grani was supposed to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobo Blasterco was supposed to come,
but some shit happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was going to ride with me,
but yesterday afternoon he sent me a
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, hey, bro, I don't feel super
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my kid got me sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you're sick, don't even go to
an event like that because we're all going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be smoking together, and I don't want
to get sick from you hitting my rig,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't think we should go get
everybody else sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike decided to stay home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsey, the traveling stoner,
and Bobo Blasterco, and the Davin Grani
[SPEAKER_00]: all cruised up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they got to the door,
one of them, I will not single anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: out, but one of those dudes, the dude in
that group that forgot his ID,
[SPEAKER_00]: forgot his ID and kind of hosed everyone
so nobody else went in since one person
[SPEAKER_00]: did not have his ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave all them a hug, and they turned
around and drove.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where they even went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume they went back to Springs or
Pueblo, but they left the event and took
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even get to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been even more fun with you
there because a lot of podcast listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: were there and they were asking for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in attendance, Jesse Grosz showed up
at the Dude Grosz Cup with the legendary
[SPEAKER_00]: 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with Jesse Grosz and 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great-ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met a whole bunch of cool-ass
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I parked my car directly across
the street from Cultivated Synergy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got out of the car, and I wasn't 10
feet from the car before people started
[SPEAKER_00]: yelling, yo, it's Rasta Jeff, yo,
take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I got out of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I walked toward the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple people greeted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to the end of the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was getting in line, a dude named
Tony was like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tony from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started talking to Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy and his girlfriend came up and
started talking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I had so much ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to them briefly and got sucked
into Tony's conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony and his friend, I think his friend's
buddy, his buddy's name was Paul is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your face in my head, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Tony and Paul were cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have picked up the Arise
clone that is available at our Organica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got the 35% tested THC clone
from Organica.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing it out there in New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my new friends that I made
from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to my friends that I made
from Kansas City.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say your guys' names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect your privacy that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some really cool new friends to
listen to the podcast from Kansas City.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pair of brothers, cool ass dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great chatting with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a lot from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely great hearing how much
you listen to the show and how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: have learned from listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also made some friends from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys want me to say
your names, but there are three dudes from
[SPEAKER_00]: California, two dudes from Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy was from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to hang out with them for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was a couple from Denver that
I met that was super fun to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I met a guy, I don't remember if he
said Iowa or Idaho, but either way,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said that by listening to my podcast,
he was able to learn how to grow and build
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow and fund to grow and fund his move
to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he is employed by one of the
leading dispensaries in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got to give me a fist bump last
night and tell me thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of stuff means the world to me,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people coming up to me and
telling me, hey, you taught me how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made my garden so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the biggest smile inside and outside
all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hard to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just cheesing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all the cool people that
I got to meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people that were giving me love
for what I do for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it all worth it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a joke about how if anybody ever
has any questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that if you send me a
question and I'm answering your question,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm not just talking to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody, I think it was from Texas,
he goes, man, you're not talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that guy, if you remember who you are,
I know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wearing a San Antonio Spurs hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me know that I'm not
talking to myself out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greatest part was, you guys,
this event had nothing to do with my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have given me several shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have given them several shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people knew that I was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were excited to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Dude Grows Cup, I had a little Girl
From Your Heart section hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out, much love, much respect,
much thanks to Scotty and the Dude from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows Cup, and especially all the
people that came and said, what's up to
[SPEAKER_00]: me?
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm rambling about that,
but it really meant a lot, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's huge when people give you praise for
the work that you do in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get to meet a large group of
people and they're thanking you for what
[SPEAKER_00]: you do, it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially people that you know are
already able to grow without your
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, you pushed me to the next
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, it was an event and we
were going to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: judging the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way that they did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the events we go to, the judges
are offered a judges pack where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: given a bag with every entry labeled with
a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're supposed to consume that
in your choice of method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a bowl, a joint, however you want
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say there are 40 entries, you're given
little baggies with numbers one through 40
[SPEAKER_00]: written on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to take your own notes and
decide what the winner was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it a little bit differently at
the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of like the way that they did
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of giving everybody a gift bag,
there was a section, one whole section of
[SPEAKER_00]: the venue where there were little
Budtender stations lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were basically countertops with jars
of samples of entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those jars were labeled with a
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I think there were about 50
entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were labeled one through 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would stand in line and you would
go up to the front and then you would tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the Budtender what number samples you
wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Budtenders had a few different
samples in front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like each Budtender had three or
four, four or five different samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd walk up, you'd get in line,
you'd walk up to one guy, you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try whatever you had in front of
them, one, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would give you a fresh one hitter
when you started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a brand new little clean one
hitter pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to smoke each sample,
but you got to stand in line a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: to get through every sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a cool way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just sitting there and hoarding
your 50 sample pack, it made it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more communal because everybody had to go
up to that one area where the samples
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to meet the Budtender and you
kind of had to hang out and be in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that being in line right there forced
more people to interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I see a lot of at these
events, I used to go with Kevin a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go with Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of the times I end up up there
with the Traveling Stoner and Bobo Blaster
[SPEAKER_00]: Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Brett from Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got kind of clicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten kind of clicky is what I
think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put us all in a line like
that to go taste the samples, all those
[SPEAKER_00]: clicks go away because you end up in line
next to other people for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up making friends with
new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew some people when I walked in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew a lot of people when I left there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good social experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other dab and smoke events
that we go to do seem to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: clicky, a little elitist, a little,
there's a little bit of a dickhead vibe at
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any ego at this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a bunch of people hanging out,
smoking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one cool thing that they did,
they did a huge raffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling tickets for this raffle,
dirty cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of regret not participating in
the raffle, but there wasn't anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely would have loved to have
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were giving away Hortilux bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were giving away double-ended ceramic
metal halide bulbs, which are brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were giving away nutrient packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave away tons of stuff, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given away a few things on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave away a truckload of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice little kitchen area here
where I record.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Girl From Your Heart podcast studio is
honestly my dining room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the stuff they gave away would fill
this space in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much shit they gave away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it was super cool that the
Dude Grows Cup was able to give back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure Way to Grow sponsored
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Pea sponsored them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of, who's the company
that they use Recharge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Recharge was heavily involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a bunch of good giveaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave away a bunch of Hortilux bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they gave away a Quest
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of shit was given away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a huge shout out to the guys for giving
stuff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me that they give
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I was going to talk about,
I talked about the entries and I talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about the judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I kind of want to talk a little bit
about what I saw from the entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were approximately 50 entries from
what I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to, I did kind of an
asshole move, but I just wanted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: quick about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I made myself clear on what I
was trying to do to anybody that was
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine all the lines are going one
way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The lines are running back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked up about three people into the
line and I didn't cut anybody because I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't getting in the line, but I just cut
through the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like, I crossed all the
intersections and I walked from one end to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other and just eyeballed all of the
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave a quick visual, visual glance,
kind of a fly by because I'm so tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a fly over and crept at all the
tables to see what the samples looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave me a good idea of what I
wanted to try before I even got in line to
[SPEAKER_00]: waste my time to go smoke some samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be an asshole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that 40 of those 50
samples needed to be trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not trim them worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were samples in there that could
have been winners if the grower or trimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: would have taken another step and just
knock off all those little shitty leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: that were on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse said, yeah, they do have a bunch of
trichomes on those leaves, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look good and it's not appealing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm certain that it affects the flavor
and you can knock those trichomes off and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into your hash and make some
concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the main problem that I saw
with most of the product, most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entries was that it was not trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something that tasted like a
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a real funky blueberry flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that was definitely Girl
Scout Cookies dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that looked like it was
going to be real good, but it tasted kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of hay-like and kind of burnt my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of the others I kind of ignored
because they were so leafy that it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even look appealing to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about how to
trim your products if you want the best
[SPEAKER_00]: bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you intend on entering something
into a cup that is going to be judged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first I need to take a dab and a drink
because I feel like I'm talking way too
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take care of my head and
my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys take a quick dab too
and then I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking some Golden Goat Shatter
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Barefoot Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barefoot Extracts for keeping me laced up
with super fresh, super clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: super delicious, super potent shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow the products and then I pass it
over to our buddy Will and he takes care
[SPEAKER_00]: of the extraction process for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like knowing that the
products you're dabbing were grown with
[SPEAKER_00]: love and extracted with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something sweet about knowing
there's safety and quality in your
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go into talking about proper
trim technique, there are a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: things I missed in the intro here because
I was just rambling my face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned in previous episodes that I
was going to record a podcast at the Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did not happen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had all of the recording equipment that
I needed with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really loud in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not have been able to get any
useful recording even if I did try to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up and record.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music was fucking loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a bunch of people in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to kind of yell and it sucks when
you're in a place that loud and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking dabs and you're trying to yell
over everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of why.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my voice sounds like I am Mr.
Movie Phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press one if you know the name of the
movie you'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from taking too many dabs and
trying to yell over everybody all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excuse the throat and the excessive
throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I did not record.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there is no live stuff coming
from the Dude Grows Cup that I recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I talked about the judging I never
talked about the voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walked into the Dude Grows Cup,
you were given a lanyard, which meant you
[SPEAKER_00]: were a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around the lanyard are the,
it's right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to walk away from the
microphone to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around the lanyard are numbers and
that's how many entries there were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go and you sample the entry,
they punch that number off of your
[SPEAKER_00]: lanyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know that you've tested sample
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a number one,
two, three, four, five, however many
[SPEAKER_00]: entries there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were 40, maybe 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: They punch out the number that you've
tried so that that way you can't just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking the same entries over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if you fall in love with the one,
you can't go smoke all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the voting went, also when you walked
in, they gave you some tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like some Pirates of the
Caribbean tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just plastic tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably got them from the dollar
store, the party store or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some plastic tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you appreciated a strain,
you were to give the budtender that token
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask them to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jars were behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would give them the token and they
would put it in the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd say, Hey, I like number 22 the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you throw this token into number 22?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you were given five tokens
when you walked in and you were also given
[SPEAKER_00]: one free raffle ticket when you walked in
so that you had everybody won something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I left before the end of the raffle
because the raffle was taking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even Scotty and the dude had to
take a break in the middle because the
[SPEAKER_00]: raffle was taking so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked about the voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the tokens they gave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for not recording any live
material at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you guys, I was having a good
ass time taking dads with my old friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and my new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jesse, Jesse grows is a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little bit shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, he's just not as socially
outgoing as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people would start talking to
me, sometimes I need a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat starts burning out and I want to
take a dab and chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be like, Hey, that's Jesse from the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several people were super excited to
meet Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were thanking Jesse for all their
outdoor success, especially Tony,
[SPEAKER_00]: because our, my new friend Tony is growing
out in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's growing in an outdoor environment and
Jesse has taught, taught him a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: useful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jesse, I hope that wasn't too much for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 44 was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to introduce 44 to a few podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is I was too busy being
social and having fun to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was too loud in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recording didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to say,
Hey, who won?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which strain won the dude grows cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you guys, it was 10 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tired as high as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a two hour drive to get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I had to work today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to pack up my stuff and get out
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 10 30 or 11, I boogied out,
drove back down to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: No incident on the drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice straight two hour drive made it about
130 miles to the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got home late, crashed out for a couple
of hours, woke up and I had to go take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of the grow because I'm a nice boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave the whole grow crew the day off
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I did not stick around for the
judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know who won the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know who won the dude grows
cup Monday, you've got to listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out their podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit different format than
mine, but you will certainly enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm talking about pitching podcasts,
you guys, I am going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming buds here in just a minute,
but I've got a bunch of other stuff on my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab and so it just made my ADD
fire up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of podcasts, several people
mentioned my friend, Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be talking about podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be talking about whatever and people
would bring up Bo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bo, you were loved in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get you out here to Colorado to
one of these events so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: partake.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the dabs, you can hang out with the
people and you can just feel what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like to have a bunch of people saying,
Hey, thank you for doing a podcast that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps me connect with myself and my
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bo, you got to get out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of this podcast world that's
helping the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come take some dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's a good time to tell you
guys about Patreon, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here in the middle of the podcast,
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you would like to help myself or Bo
Nellis or any podcasters out, you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: to patreon.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can go to patreon.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read all about how to
contribute to the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a service that allows listeners
to financially contribute to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs us money to, uh, put the website
up so that we can host the show guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not spend a lot of time, uh,
working on my website right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically just a, uh, it's a crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that's what it's how my podcast is
hosted to iTunes, to Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed burner, to pod bay, wherever else
you're watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's happening is through.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go to Patreon, when you
contribute the, what that funding does,
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps me pay for my blue host
account, which pays for my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to help out a podcaster,
most podcasters do have a Patreon account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not exactly sure what the Bo Nellis
and split podcast Patreons are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you search, you will find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help out a podcaster maybe in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set up a Patreon to try to get Bo to
Colorado so that we can all record a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we'll get the dude grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get Scotty real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get Bo Nellis and we'll do like a
giant MVP podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all record an episode together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll drop it on everybody's feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be epic cannabis podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about trimming weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding this, uh, Capleton nugget in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I could use a little bit of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can use some attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could use some trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's talk about trimming your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go into too much detail
about harvesting because I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: complete episodes about harvesting full
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not in the feed, I'm sure you
guys are aware that I've been putting old
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes out on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put chunks of three or four episodes out
every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are episodes from the past,
uh, a long, long time ago, the show used
[SPEAKER_00]: to be called I grow culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's another organization that goes
by the name I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I kindly changed my name so that I
don't get myself in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be associated with them on
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the show is called the grow from
your heart podcast, which is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: suiting in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I've been putting out old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of the episodes fall out of
the feed iTunes and stitcher only hold 100
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the good stuff is in the past
and the old episodes were up to 200 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, that means there's a hundred
episodes that are no longer in the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put in chunks out so that
I can try to get those old episodes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: feed without knocking out current stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, another thing I'm doing is I am making
those YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's coming, it's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get those out for you,
but I'm trying to get the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the episode all about harvesting will
be either in the feed on YouTube or coming
[SPEAKER_00]: soon in those old episodes is what I'm
getting to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to talk about the kind of
fun, uh, the final fine trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you've harvested your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just, we'll real quickly go over
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've flushed your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the beginning of harvest flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, all you need to do is feed your
plants, clean pH balanced water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is get a container,
however many plants you use, however much
[SPEAKER_00]: water you use, fill that container,
use some pH up or pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably pH down most locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some pH down, get that water to the
proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it around somewhere between six
and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do about 6.2 when I'm flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH that water to 6.2 and pour it through
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the next days, next 10 days,
just keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever add nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever the plants get, you water them,
you let them get dry and show you that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up some more water that's 6.2 and
water those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that for at least 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it for 10 to 14, maybe 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people do it for 21 full days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to put nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that much nutrients you are saving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush your damn plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I get on a rant when I talk about
flushing because it's so easy and people
[SPEAKER_00]: do not do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I take a hit off your bowl,
before that smoke hits my lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say you didn't flush that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny part is one of our friends
that I met at the Dude Grows Cut passed me
[SPEAKER_00]: some weed and he's like, this one's got
like a spicy taste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hit it and I blew out the hit before
I got my smoke all the way out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, do you use worm casting tea in
your mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I think you're using a little
too much worm castings because I can taste
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his buddy, excuse me, my throat's
clogging up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this dude's friend said,
I told you, you've been going too hard
[SPEAKER_00]: with the worm casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could taste that shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't use too much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to flush out anything that
you've used excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like VegBloom, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to flush out really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a paid advertisement or
anything, but VegBloom seems like it
[SPEAKER_00]: flushed out very nicely in my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush, then pre-trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in and take off all the large
leaves a few days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chop those off, take them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then cut your plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them hang upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either wet trim or dry trim at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet trim obviously means you go at them
while they're still wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna need some scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna need gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how you do this, wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please get yourself some nitrile gloves,
some latex gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glove up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want trichomes all over
yourself, and I don't wanna smoke your
[SPEAKER_00]: skin flakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to Walgreens, go to Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to order mine off of amazon.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come straight to the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna buy a bunch, I recommend
Uline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uline sells a lot of gloves, but you gotta
buy a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get yourself a bucket of extra large
black gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as giraffe pussy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can wet trim or you can dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously wet trim, you cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start trimming now while it's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a pain in the ass,
but once you're done trimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing left to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it all handled at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta let it hang there and dry,
and then you gotta cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that's gonna have to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry trim, you can cut the plant down,
let it hang upside down until it's dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can trim it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need gloves, but it's not as
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of grab the buds and get in
there with my finger, my thumbnails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wearing gloves, so it's not really
your thumbnail, but it's like your thumb
[SPEAKER_00]: tip, and you can just knock the lid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves off with your thumb,
and you can go super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing when you're wet trimming,
I like wet trimming because you can get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and really cut off everything,
and then when it dries, the bud shrinks
[SPEAKER_00]: up, and you can't see any leaf in there at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bud textures, it's very advantageous
to trim it while the bud's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff, my stuff like the Grateful
Dog, the Capelton, the Capelton I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: holding right now, this is really dense
and it's not super leafy, so I like to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: trim this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cut down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I flush it, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take off all the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it hang upside down for four,
I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang it upside down until the sticks
snap, like grab a stem and bend it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want it to go crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut all the buds off of the sticks into
like a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a big dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cut all the buds off the sticks
into that dish, and then I throw all the
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sticks are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a bucket or a bowl of nice
buds with little leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go through and I cut off all of
the, like the sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep all of that sugar leaf and I make
hash out of all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's got a little bit of
trichome on it goes into another container
[SPEAKER_00]: and it dries out real fine, and that gets
turned into hash, and that is my cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: get crazy, take giant dabs and waste a
bunch of dabs hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my friends come over, when I smoke
with a bunch of people, you can take as
[SPEAKER_00]: big of a dab as you want, because this is
just trim run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I knock off all that big stuff,
I fine trim the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this little bud of Capleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the big stuff's basically been taken
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the bud shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these little tiny, tiny buds
sticking out, and I'm honestly just
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking them off with my thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my thumb hitting the microphone
after it knocked it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just basically rubbing this bud and
brushing off most of these little leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's dry enough, but it's not
super crusty, and those leaves are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to knock those leaves
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to leave that stuff on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two things that really drive me
crazy, and you're going to laugh when I
[SPEAKER_00]: say the words, but when I explain them,
you will completely understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that drives me fucking nuts is
something called crow's feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little tiny, tiny leaves that are
sticking out, there's a part where this
[SPEAKER_00]: one bud meets another part of the bud,
and there's a little leaf just sticking
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm just going to pull it off
with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave that on there, that's called
a crow's foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little pokey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a V.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two leaves that stick off like a V.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got a pound of weed with a
bunch of crow's feet in it, it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: look ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take out all those crow's feet,
that pound of weed looks way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's another thing that is still
on this bud, because it's not done being
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the handlebars.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom of the bud, where the bud's
been cut off of the stick, there are two
[SPEAKER_00]: little sticks, little tiny, tiny stems,
where a leaf used to be on each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called handlebars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a bud and you hold it upside
down, you'll know exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe can make a jet ski out of this little
bud, and that's where G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe would hold on to these two little
sticks where there used to be leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those drive me fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of your handlebars, get rid of
your crow's feet, and it will make your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds look way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow down, get in there, take that shit
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the main difference between the
winning and losing buds that I saw last
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trim your shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to see the shape of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get excessive and get in there and
mash it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're dry trimming, you should be able
to rub it, and you'll see exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of your bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not a dense bud, you may need to
work on adding some kelp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get some airflow in there,
and you may need more light, or you may
[SPEAKER_00]: need a better phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's dry trimmed, you should be able
to just rub it and knock off all those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's wet trimmed, you don't need to
pull it open too far, but pull it open a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and cut those leaves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the bud dries, it'll shrink around
those leaves, and you won't even see them
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be just fine, but take that stuff
out, because it's making your weed look
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, leaves contain chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to smoke chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes it longer to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not here to smoke leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to smoke buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're honestly here to smoke trichome
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even need this green part,
so let's minimize the green shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on the good part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what drives me crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people try to have a gigantic bud,
this bud that I'm holding in my hand right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is probably the size of a golf ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I'm done playing with it,
it's going to be five or six little,
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny, bowl-sized buds, because there's a
stick in the middle of this, and nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to buy or carry around a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear me just breaking off the buds
off the stick right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and it looks so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to give me big,
impressive, fancy buds, give me buds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are well-manicured, take them off the
stick, take off your crow's feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: take off the handlebars, and when you
start looking at your buds when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming, you will know what crow's feet
and handlebars are as soon as you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cabbage leaves at the bottom,
that's part of the handlebars and crow's
[SPEAKER_00]: feet, but that cabbage shit at the bottom,
take off the cabbage, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimmers will know what I'm talking about
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll dawn on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make mediocre weed look like
much better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to upgrade your weed that much
just by trimming, putting a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: effort into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, think about something that's called
the rule of thumb, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that bud isn't the size of your thumb,
why are you trimming it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wasting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making hash or if you're making
edible vegetables, put that into the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spend 10 minutes trimming a bud that
market value would only be worth 50 cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste your time on something that's
not monetarily worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a bigger bud, trim it, throw that
other shit in the hash pile, and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say wear gloves enough times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves, please, because I don't want
your skin flakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you're doing with cannabis,
you should wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're touching a plant, you should
wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're touching the pot, if you're in
the grow, you should probably just put on
[SPEAKER_00]: some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about pesticide contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wear gloves in the grow, especially
when trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever rub your eyes when you're
trimming, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll only take once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start trimming, and your eyes will
start itching because there's so much just
[SPEAKER_00]: weed smell in the air, and everything is
sticky, and your eye will itch just
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, and you're going to rub your
eye, and it'll take about seven seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go, ah, fuck, and you'll know
what you just did, and it's going to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to quit trimming for
a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that was 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is blown out because I took so
many dabs last night at the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody that I hung out with,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the Dude and Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on to Jesse and 44 for hanging out
because the people that I had anticipated
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with didn't show up to play,
so I had to go play all by myself and make
[SPEAKER_00]: new friends, so it was good that those
guys showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had somebody to kick it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out three episodes last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the normal Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode with Lindsey,
the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also did the big block of old
school episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you caught all of those.

listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove home with a big, goofy smile.

million dabs, but that was partly for
[SPEAKER_00]: making so many great friends.

the podcast on iTunes and Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episodes are available on my website.
