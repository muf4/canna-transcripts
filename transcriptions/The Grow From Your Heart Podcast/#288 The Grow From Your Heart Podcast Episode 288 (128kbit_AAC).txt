[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to call these Thursday episodes the
Thursday quickie.
[SPEAKER_01]: These quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the hella dank seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out at dank seed
dot store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get on with the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with what I am going to call a
Thursday quickie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am out of throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until I generate a bunch of content,
I'm going to try to throw out these
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday quickies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't promise you a quickie every week,
but when we get to one, you'll be glad you
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since I'm all caught up on the
throwback Thursday episodes, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work extra hard at getting the YouTube
channel caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where all the old content will be
stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about the throwback Thursday
episodes was iTunes will only allow me to
[SPEAKER_01]: post 100 episodes in my feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like some of my really valuable
content was within my first hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got pushed out of the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted a place for the old content to
be accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made that the throwback Thursday
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's just pushing new
content out of the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just perpetuating the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So YouTube does not limit me on how many
uploads and videos I post.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can put all 300 of the episodes up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only got 288 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working toward 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be able to put all 300, all 500 up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to take me time to get
them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will be archived on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start getting fresh content coming
out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to promise these Thursday
episodes every week, but like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I get to it, it will be worth
checking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we are for now with the
Thursday situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to share what I'm smoking on at the
start of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a tradition here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a big fan of the apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got myself some Titan OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to crack this open and give it a
sniffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like OG, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells exactly like what you'd expect
an OG to smell like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like, I always say coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think OG has a little bit of coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of chocolate to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a silky smooth undertone
that I cannot identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of Bubba cushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got sort of a Bubba kush sort of a
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a pre 98 Bubba kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever smoked that, it's sort of
what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got the Titan OG batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep describing the texture of the
batter as battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a thick butter or soft
cheesecake or cake batter and just scooped
[SPEAKER_01]: a gram of it perfectly into the center of
this container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've been taking the Titan OG and
then I like to take the Titan OG batter
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've got some blue ghost high
cannabinoid full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said high cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really went in on that word,
a high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to take the batter,
get a nice chunky size dab and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: dip it into the crystals and pick up a
couple of crystals to go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then dab that all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lung expansion, the head high,
it's been a great high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the crystals don't have a lot of
flavor, but they have a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mix is really nice for me,
but that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also been dabbing on some of the sour
Clem, of course it is almost gone because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going in on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm finishing up the garden of
Weed and sour diesel batter as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking a lot of variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the concentrates I've been
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I mention that this podcast is brought
to you by our friends at the Hela Dank
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Bank?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need some iry genetic seeds,
check out the Hela Dank Seed Bank at
[SPEAKER_01]: dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking about batter,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said something about batter to me
the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I don't know why you smoke
that batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer my concentrates to be
purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I paused and the look on my face said,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you are buying batters from a
reputable dispensary in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even most likely on the black market,
the batters are better purged than some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the shatters or some of the other
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't know how everybody makes their
concentrates, but this is kind of how a
[SPEAKER_01]: batter is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: A batter comes from the way that they're
doing it at Apothecary is they are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with their Ambrosia, which is
their premier product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ambrosia is basically the high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals
[SPEAKER_01]: with high terpene full spectrum extract
terps poured into it and they mix it at
[SPEAKER_01]: their ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crystal-y, it's terpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't buy it myself because I don't want
the terp soup at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to scrape it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather get the batter where it all
comes with me in one chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they take the Ambrosia and they'll
take a portion of the Ambrosia and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they whip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not tell me how it's whipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't tell me their technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it done several different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of guys use a glass wand and you
heat the concentrate and you just whip it
[SPEAKER_01]: like a whisk with your wrist, with the
glass wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just whip the shit out of it with that
glass wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let your wrist get floppy and just
whisk it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you're doing is adding air to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now think about if you have a product like
Ambrosia, which is a quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, we have lab testing that
shows residuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have too many residual PPMs of a
gas of a hydrocarbon, which is what butane
[SPEAKER_01]: would be, if there are too many residuals
of that hydrocarbon of the butane in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you're not allowed to sell the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Ambrosia passes the test already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they take that and they whip the shit
out of it to turn it into batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're whipping it and putting all
that oxygen into it, don't you think
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna let out any more butane that
would have been in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would release that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: The batters actually test cleaner for
residual PPMs than the shatters and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Ambrosias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's gonna be true most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also seem to be, it brings out
the turps a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put that air into it,
it brings out the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing to base this on except my
own thought process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no influence here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you crack open wine or beer,
when the air, when you pour it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain glass, they serve alcoholic
beverages in certain shaped glasses to
[SPEAKER_01]: create certain air flows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that air flow mixing in with
the concentrate enhances the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about the way you whip
it and add the oxygen in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes it more aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is purged and it also tastes really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like the way the batters
expand on the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you seem to think that batters are
not purged, most of the time they are
[SPEAKER_01]: better purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm gonna segue into another part
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking PHO, which is propane
honey oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff is purged.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something about the propane honey oil,
I talk about I enjoy the lung expansion on
[SPEAKER_01]: the batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not like the way the PHO makes my
lungs feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I take a big dab, a medium dab,
a small dab of PHO, it feels like an
[SPEAKER_01]: elephant is sitting on my chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like I'm in some jujitsu hold
that I do not wanna fucking be in and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanna tap out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like smoking PHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got about a gram left and I'll smoke
it because I bought it and it gets me high
[SPEAKER_01]: as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will not buy more and I'll probably
pass on propane honey oil dabs should
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody offer them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it feels like I'm drowning when
I smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smoke a gram dab of good PHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave me a half gram dab of shatter
right now, I might cough a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've been dabbing all day and I've
been talking and I'm kinda dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a half gram dab wouldn't hurt my
feelings of some shatter of PHO,
[SPEAKER_01]: butane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a half gram dab of propane honey oil
would fucking kill me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be able to talk for an hour and
it wouldn't be the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be the lung pressure and the
lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be able to inhale and exhale
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels so heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's even when it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but that's just
something that I've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the batter is purged you guys and PHO
makes my lungs heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the summary of what I just rambled
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a Thursday quickie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna move quickly through the topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got a couple of bullet points
that I wanna talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I noticed and that I've wanted
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people water their plants,
not incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a way that is maybe inefficient and
there's a better way you could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people aim for the center of the
pot when they water a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a pitcher of water or the hose,
the water wand or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe they're using one of those fancy
water cans from Target with the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: painted on the side and it's got your
mom's name printed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever you're watering with,
they aim for the center of the pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be better if you delivered the
water to the outer edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when your plants are little,
yeah, you should probably water the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plants and where the roots are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when your plants are large and they
have grown to meet the size pot that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are in, when the roots are filling the pot
in which they are sitting, you should
[SPEAKER_01]: water the outer edge, the outer area with
more water and then less water toward the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for that is that inside is
gonna get saturated and it's gonna stay
[SPEAKER_01]: wet in there longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those roots are gonna find water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is gonna be right there in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will look for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you water that outer edge, they'll go
out there and get that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep flooding the inside,
those roots will just stay there and get
[SPEAKER_01]: bored and get stagnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta make them work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water the outside and the roots will go
out to the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get your nutrients out to the
outside by watering it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get water out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those roots will go out there also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll develop a larger root system and a
bigger root system will make a bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: happier, more productive plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we want overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stop watering directly in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water toward the outer edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a bad habit of watering
directly in the middle, our friend Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spliff taught us to make little pyramids,
little domes in the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab some dirt and just make a little cone
right around the trunk of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way when you do water,
all the water runs away from the trunk and
[SPEAKER_01]: it runs out to the outer edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it sinks down in there and then it
gets the outer edge wet and then those
[SPEAKER_01]: roots have nutrients and water out there
at the outer edge and they'll grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't flood the middle of the
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the middle of the pot's gonna stay
soggy a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That outer edge is gonna dry up,
so get it wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you actually look at the shape of a
cannabis plant and the way that the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: work, how many times have you tried to
water the plant when you're in the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room and you're kneeling down and you've
got your watering device and you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting the leaves with the water and it
pushes the leaves out to the outer edge of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot or even onto the floor?
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, cannabis plants are sort of
shaped like an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that the leaves work is sort
of umbrella-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water will land on the leaf and the
leaf will bend down just enough to let
[SPEAKER_01]: that water drip off onto the next leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leaf bends and that leaf bends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it does it, it pushes the water
outward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just spread my arms like you can
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pushes the water outward with each
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it falls, it moves further and further
from the center of the plant until it hits
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground and then it lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet that the water makes a nice
little ring around the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet if you stood directly above a lot of
trees and watched water fall, you'd see a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice ring around a lot of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet that's where the most productive
root system is in those trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: is right around that perimeter where the
rain is allowed to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind, your cannabis plants are
shaped like an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably want that water to get
spread out like that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis roots seem to prefer wider spaces
than deeper spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can give it a wider space,
it'll grow wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant will have, I mean, just imagine
if you spread your legs, you can hold your
[SPEAKER_01]: balance better than if you put your feet
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could grow wider if you could
spread your feet further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water the outer perimeter of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, one more quick thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to end this quickie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving you a warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is illegal in the
state of Colorado to take your cannabis on
[SPEAKER_01]: federal property, federal property like a
state park.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot go in a state park with your
medical or recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're an adult, if you've got
cannabis and you go to the Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: Reservoir or any other reservoir,
I'm just trying to think of random state
[SPEAKER_01]: parks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot go to Mueller State Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot go to Golden Gate Canyon State
Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot go to Garden of the Gods with
medical or recreational cannabis on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are caught in possession of medical
or recreational cannabis with or without a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana card, you will be
charged with illegal possession of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because that is federal land and
cannabis is not federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only legal in the state of Colorado
by state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal law supersedes that, especially
when you were on federal land,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were playing by their rules and their
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you come to Colorado and you want to
go get some cannabis and you want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: see some sites, make sure that you do not
end up on federal land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not go to a state park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not go to a university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not go to a military base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you'd probably be paranoid to
take your cannabis on your military base,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have a friend of the podcast who
her husband is part of Fort Carson,
[SPEAKER_01]: the military base in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a well-known cannabis patient and
advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has to be very careful not to take her
medical and recreational cannabis onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: base when she goes with her husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she has to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have another friend who had to
write a letter to his higher up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the rank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for being ignorant in military
ranks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to write a letter and apologize and
request permission to still be allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out with his friends on the base
because he was caught with medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was lucky that he had his medical
marijuana recommendation with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was lucky that he'd been outspoken
about his medical marijuana activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his PTSD experiences in the past,
or it may not have worked out so well for
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend, but they did have some
compassion for him and they let him go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had to write a letter and apologize
and request permission to go back onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: base and promise to never bring his
medical marijuana or his recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana back to the base ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's very careful not to,
because they will arrest him next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to a reservoir to do some
jet skiing, some boating, please do not
[SPEAKER_01]: take your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, be fucking careful because if
they catch you with it, you are on federal
[SPEAKER_01]: land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they can do to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will certainly be charged with illegal
possession of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not old enough, if you're not
21, you may be a minor in possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not 18, you may be a minor in
possession of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what could happen to you on
federal land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish Mike were here, but it would be
awkward having a quickie with Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.

[SPEAKER_00]: I set the people in a one harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about creation, creative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the rain falls in the spring,
oh, what a blessing it bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers bloom, trees turn green,
and everything has been washed clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the people working outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone with a smile in the warm
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working to bring justice to the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at a straight redemption time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redemption time.
