[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 343 of the Grow From

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hela Dank Seed

[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 343 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is described as gas and earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped this open and took a fat dab of
this and it was tremendous earthy gas all
[SPEAKER_00]: over my tongue, all in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Infinity OG Nectar was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I decided to do, you know me,
I took a good size dab of the Infinity OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Nectar and then I dunked that right inside
of the Lemon Versace Nectar and I took a
[SPEAKER_00]: dab of that combo and that is like a lemon
gas punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave me a super nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a tremendous face height to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went right to my face, right to my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an amazing combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Infinity OG put the punch in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put that gas in there and then that
Lemon Versace put that lemon skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: candy turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of washed out that burnt
marshmallow and brought out more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good idea I thought to mix
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Infinity OG Nectar and the Lemon
Versace Nectar combination from Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's got me nice and ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is good because this is going to be
a long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great topic to get into,
but first let's talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I did Thursday evening while you guys
were hanging out listening to the new
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Denver seeing Wheeler Walker Jr.
at the Gothic Theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you know who Wheeler Walker Jr.
is, you're probably going, what Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: went to a country concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know who Wheeler Walker
Jr. is, let me explain to you that Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff went to a country concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never referred to myself in third
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yes, I went to my very first
country concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Wheeler Walker Jr. and two other
acts at the Gothic Theater in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to see Wheeler because I think
Wheeler Walker is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes out dressed in full cowboy,
fucking rebel cowboy outfit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his boots and his tight jeans and
his fucking belt buckle that you could use
[SPEAKER_00]: as a dinner plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's got a long sleeve flannel
shirt tucked in and he's got it buttoned
[SPEAKER_00]: up all the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's got the cowboy beard that's
well kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just long enough to say I'm a rebel
motherfucker, but then it's kept nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: tight also.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that big bushy mustache.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got them cop glasses looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's got his big Wheeler Walker
Jr. cowboy hat on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he comes out and they start playing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into country music necessarily,
but I don't hate country music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hired to play in country bands
before and you learn to appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not bad, especially the shit
Wheeler does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fun kind of country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that rowdy fucking I guess it's
called rebel country is what they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a country fan, but I think so he
comes out and he does this like rock and
[SPEAKER_00]: roll country shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he starts singing lyrics that are
just ridiculous and we'll get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the show and then
then we'll top this off with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: song titles and some of the lyrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I drive up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I park.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm walking in I realize I am the only
dreadlocked guy in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only one there that is not a
country music fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far I'm the only one I've seen that is
there for the joke that is Wheeler Walker
[SPEAKER_00]: Jr. And I'm kind of feeling a little bit
out of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first band was straight up country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fucking good you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were soulful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a singer that played acoustic
guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a full band bass drums lead
guitar, but the singer played acoustic
[SPEAKER_00]: guitar and they had a female singer that
sang with him that I'm going to assume
[SPEAKER_00]: they were related.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be brother or sister somewhere
along the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been singing together for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they sounded rich like the sound
that came out of them was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sounded really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know the name of the opening
act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pay any attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to get comfortable in
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of country fans you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was folks in tight jeans and flannel
shirts and fucking beards and a wad of
[SPEAKER_00]: chew and a hat in their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they're going to take me
encroaching on their show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just trying to walk around and like
you know get a feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I welcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of silly on my part to feel
that these country fans may not want me
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a few looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody gave a shit that I was a weirdo
at the country show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second act came on and I spent
the first since I just snuck in during the
[SPEAKER_00]: first band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to go walk right in front of
people while the band is playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just went toward the back of the club
and got a big view of the whole club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the first band picked up their
gear I walked closer to the stage and got
[SPEAKER_00]: a little up closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second opener came out and he
was not very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crowd was talking over him and kind of
they were they were bored with him and he
[SPEAKER_00]: could feel the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then someone lit a joint in the crowd
or some weed somewhere and the country
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd got really weird about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny part is it was bad smelling
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like a shitty roach or it just
didn't smell like good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone lit weed and that country
crowd kind of got uptight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're kind of some of them
are like someone's smoking weed and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are like oh someone's smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of a it was way different
than the shows I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When someone smokes weed nobody even
notices because we're all smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just really funny to smell
somebody light some swag weed and then
[SPEAKER_00]: watch the whole crowd kind of look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them looked right at me like
no I can see both his hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't gonna fucking smoke weed in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the only one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they run you through a pretty rigorous
security thing on the way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that second opener that
came out it was one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came out and played a couple of songs
by himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up actually being Wheeler's bass
player.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Wheeler came out that was the bass
player for Wheeler Walker Jr.'s band
[SPEAKER_00]: anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first opener was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second opener was awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just one dude singing songs playing
guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played bass and sang a couple of times
which that's not really a popular thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: play bass and sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone lit weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a couple of as the night went on and
things got later more non-country fans
[SPEAKER_00]: came.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people that looked like they
discovered Wheeler through Joe Rogan's
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people that looked like they
discovered Wheeler Walker Jr. through Joey
[SPEAKER_00]: Diaz's podcast or Burt Kreischer's podcast
which are all places where I've listened
[SPEAKER_00]: to Wheeler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first found Wheeler through the Joe
Rogan Experience podcast and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: liked his songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started listening and I thought it was
funny and then he was on Diaz's show and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I listened there and I just kind of
like solidified that the songs were in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head and the dude's attitude was kind of
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to listen from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway more people started piling in as
the night went on that were obviously not
[SPEAKER_00]: country fans or at least they weren't
dressed in the country of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spot the differences in the
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of younger cats stood in front
of me and I'm wearing a Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast t-shirt and one of the
younger bros turns to me and he says whose
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like oh it's my show bro it's all
about weed and we start talking for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like what other shows do you
listen to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like oh dude I listen to Doug
loves movies I listen to Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually they asked me if I listen to The
Church of What's Happening Now and my
[SPEAKER_00]: answer was probably fuck yeah cocksucker
because if you listen to The Church of
[SPEAKER_00]: What's Happening Now that's your answer if
somebody asks you if you listen to it you
[SPEAKER_00]: say fuck yeah cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that started conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two young dudes named Doug and Daniel they
were a good time to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the show by myself so it was
cool to have two dudes show up right in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me that were fans of all the
other stuff I listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fans of Wheeler because of the
funniness not because it's the new kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: country music and they also are exposed to
the podcast now so shout out to Doug and
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel I hope you guys are listening to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our conversation gets interrupted
because fucking Wheeler Walker wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out and do a concert right so the
lights go down and Wheeler comes out and
[SPEAKER_00]: he starts playing honestly what might be
my favorite Wheeler Walker song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a song's actually called Sit
on My Face we're gonna get into that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit here and I posted a couple of
really cool videos to YouTube I hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wheeler comes out he plays his first
song at the end of the first song he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like why are you flipping me off and some
girl in the crowd has been flipping him
[SPEAKER_00]: off for the whole first song so he kicked
her the fuck out which kind of made it
[SPEAKER_00]: awkward but then he went right back into
the show which was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played a bunch of great songs you guys
I've got a list of the songs on my phone
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna pull it up here but he played a
brand new weed song he's like hey since
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado I figured I would debut my
new weed song and I was smart enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull out my phone I got a pretty sweet
recording of that so that's up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he played more songs they were listed
on my phone I'm gonna read some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: titles let's do that now let's see some of
the songs he played were Finger in My Butt
[SPEAKER_00]: he played a song called Eatin Pussy and
Kickin Ass and the encore was Pussy King
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the other one of the encores I'm
not even gonna say the fucking name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: song because it's kind of offensive and I
don't even want to say that on my show so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can tell he comes out and he plays his
country music right the whole band is
[SPEAKER_00]: dressed country it looks like you're at a
fucking serious country show and this dude
[SPEAKER_00]: starts singing and he starts singing about
like I said the first song is called Sit
[SPEAKER_00]: on My Face this song is straight up about
sitting on my face and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious the way he does it because it's
it sounds like you're gonna hear some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those twangy fucking truck broke down dog
ran away girlfriend left me kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking rebel rock and country things
coming out but it's not it's it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious so one of the things that I
really laughed at he does a song and he at
[SPEAKER_00]: the start of the song he goes this one is
for your whole family and I knew it was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be it's a song called Family Tree
and it is a filthy song about fucking his
[SPEAKER_00]: way up your family tree and that's
literally what it's about and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines is if I had my druthers I'd butt
fuck both your brothers yes that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: this man wrote for his country song I
didn't write these lyrics I only laughed
[SPEAKER_00]: to them and reported them to you but he
says if I had my druthers I'd butt fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: both your brothers then I'd find your
sister and take her out back and fister
[SPEAKER_00]: and the funniest fucking part of the
evening was when this theater filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: people dressed in country folk attire they
looked like great hard-working people
[SPEAKER_00]: including they're really cute those little
country girls are adorable little jean
[SPEAKER_00]: shorts a little tank top and a big old
country smile and they got that sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: accent they just smile at you those
country girls are fucking adorable but
[SPEAKER_00]: then they when he says take her out back
and fister the entire theater every person
[SPEAKER_00]: in there did their own sort of animated
motion of a fisting motion there were a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of uppercuts there were a couple of
like the guy did the movie like he's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting on a rubber glove there were
everybody did some sort of fisting motion
[SPEAKER_00]: and it made me laugh so hard it was some
of the funniest shit I've seen in a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time it was unplanned it was
uncoreographed but just imagine a
[SPEAKER_00]: country-looking audience everybody looks
all nice right they got a beer in their
[SPEAKER_00]: hand their shirts are all nice you look
fucking good tonight and then this dude
[SPEAKER_00]: says take her out back and fister and
everybody made the goddamn fister motion
[SPEAKER_00]: it was hilarious it was truly hilarious to
me that's what I was there for I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: go see what that was like live in person I
honestly thought it was gonna be a sausage
[SPEAKER_00]: fest I thought there's gonna be like 40
dudes up in the front but that place was
[SPEAKER_00]: packed I was a very toward the end of the
night it was quite a diverse crowd it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't all country fan folks there were a
lot of people that I would assume found
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheeler through the podcasts like myself
and just wanted to go see this it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of comedy it's hilarious I love music I
love comedy when you mix the two that's
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my favorite shit and just seeing a
theater full of people singing along to
[SPEAKER_00]: songs like drop them out drop them out is
about letting me see your boobs and
[SPEAKER_00]: redneck shit it's just about redneck shit
and eating pussy and kicking ass was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the funniest to see just seeing these
little country girls singing eating pussy
[SPEAKER_00]: and kicking ass was so hilarious you guys
it was really funny so it was a really
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable show I couldn't believe how
cheap it was I definitely got my money's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth they cost me more in gas than it
cost to get in the show so that was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time I know a lot of people are gonna say
country music I can't stand country music
[SPEAKER_00]: it's this just a thing in your head that
has a label and you decide you don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it's got that label on it if
you can if you can appreciate the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythm and then you can go listen to the
words that are happening on top of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: put the whole picture together it will
make you a giggle it will make you laugh
[SPEAKER_00]: it's some funny shit so that's my
experience in my first country show I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if that totally counts because
it was Wheeler Walker jr. but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty damn close it's as close as I think
I'm gonna get but I had a good ass time so
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Wheeler Walker jr. and his
band and also shout out to the gothic
[SPEAKER_00]: theater you guys this podcast may get long
because I am going to do a long talk after
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a dab and a drink I'm gonna do a
talk about genetic drift we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna change the terminology we're gonna
change your mind we're gonna change your
[SPEAKER_00]: thought process on genetic drift stay
tuned I'll be right back
[SPEAKER_00]: alright podcast world I am back I am well
hydrated and heavily medicated thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: being patient with me while I got my life
together momentarily while I was gone I
[SPEAKER_00]: took some dabs of this custom OG's nectar
it is a blend of Skittles and Afgui and
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry OG the flavor is described as
assorted hard candy I didn't really get
[SPEAKER_00]: the assorted hard candies that the label
describes it's more of a it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity sort of a thing which I guess could
could could translate to fruity candy but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more of a fruit kind of a floral
nectar II kind of a thing I'm enjoying it
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a good high kind of mellowed me
out not as super high speed as I was
[SPEAKER_00]: before so that should be good for this
portion of the podcast before we took a
[SPEAKER_00]: break I teased that we were going to talk
about genetic drift and I said we were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change your mind about genetic
drift let's get right into it I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of notes on the iPad for this one so
let's start with what is genetic drift or
[SPEAKER_00]: what do we think genetic drift means some
growers believe that cloning plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple generations will lead to a loss
of plant vigor health or potency so
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if you've got a plant and you want
to grow it again right so you could take a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone off of it then you flower that plant
out now you've got a clone that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grows up you take clones off of that you
flower that out now you've got clones in
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation you just keep repeating that
process some folks believe that over time
[SPEAKER_00]: that will lead to problems which is known
as genetic drift now cannabis is an annual
[SPEAKER_00]: plant meaning it would only live for one
year or one season naturally our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season outdoors is dictated by the
Sun the natural cannabis plant life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: is usually about six to eight months long
without any human interaction depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where those plants are located from the
from the equator in relation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator they may be shorter or longer just
based on where they are so to keep our
[SPEAKER_00]: selected genetic library available we keep
mother plants mother plants are clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: select cultivars that are kept in a
perpetual vegetative state by keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle on for 18 or more hours per
day now those mother plants act as
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve for our genetic stable and also
to provide clones for production whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's for flowering them out for production
or for breeding whatever you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where the clones will come from for
the future now we're able to grow out a
[SPEAKER_00]: large mother plant and we can take 50 to
100 maybe even more clones from a single
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant and run those for production
now that ensures that all of my plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: that production run are the same thing
they're all tried true tested reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: potent female plants that I've ran before
I know that they've got resistance to pest
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got resistance to pathogens and I
know how long it takes them to flower I
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to look for I know when certain
things are gonna happen in the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: phase so I'm running 50 to 100 of the same
thing this makes my garden easy to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown this specific cultivar plenty
of times so I
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now so I
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now
[SPEAKER_00]: so I know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now so I know what to
expect I've got a relationship with it now
so I know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now so I know what to
expect I've got a relationship with it now
[SPEAKER_00]: so I know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now so I know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect I've got a relationship with it now
so I know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now so I know what to
expect I've got a relationship with it now
so I know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now so I know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect I've got a relationship with it now
so I know what to expect I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with it now so I know what to
expect I've got a relationship with it now
[SPEAKER_00]: so I know what to expect I've got a
relationship with it now so I know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect I've got a relationship with it now
so I know what to expect I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with it now so I know what to
expect I've got a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: for to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut as many as you can and then maybe
consider leaving a little portion of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant alive, just like one or two small
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave yourself one or two more clones to
cut in case you failed and you've still
[SPEAKER_00]: got that mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still keep that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little preserve over there
that it's totally looks like shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically my process of keeping
and replacing a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly similar when I'm doing it in a
small home grow, if I'm doing it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: private grow, if I'm doing it in a breeder
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly similar if I'm doing it in a
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say 100, 120 plants, consider that
the commercial grow all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The home grow, it's very small numbers
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've limited us so ridiculously in
Colorado that I'm taking like three clones
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time just to make sure I've got a
copy of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say 120, that's the commercial
grow kind of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say smaller numbers, that's the
home grow, but it's all a similar process
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're keeping mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep it in veg perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually you need to replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when we're replacing these plants,
we're cutting clones from it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to take that clone and we're
going to grow it up big again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to cut clones from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, that one's going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's going to, we're just going to
keep cutting clones off of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: off of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That starts to lead us into where genetic
drift is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suspected to start happening through
several rounds of cloning and vegging and
[SPEAKER_00]: then creating new moms and then clones and
then vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we give the opportunity for
what has been referred to as genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers suspect that these plants
get tired or that their genetics change
[SPEAKER_00]: over generations and the subsequent
generations become less vigorous,
[SPEAKER_00]: less potent and more prone to pest and
pathogenic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I personally have always been
skeptical of genetic drift and I always
[SPEAKER_00]: blamed it on poor plant health or I blamed
it on the grower or the person who cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like most of your genetic drift
issues are probably caused within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first 24 hours of propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably from inexperienced clone
techniques, poor vapor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: improper lighting, lack of nutrients or
the presence of pathogens were usually my
[SPEAKER_00]: assumptions on what was causing what
people were calling genetic drift because
[SPEAKER_00]: we would see it early on when people were
saying that they had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always been skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my flow plant since 2007 or 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timeframe is kind of fuzzy and of
course I got a traumatic brain injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know where I was when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it was about 2007, 2008 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually running that same flow plant
for her very last time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I've ran it for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been crossed with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been there, done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I keep saying there, they've
changed the rules in Colorado to where our
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to play with something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to do that, I have to retire
something old and flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for her to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running flow for her last time
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is just a few days away from being
pollinated by King Solomon to make one
[SPEAKER_00]: last batch of piranha seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's had a long fun run, but I need to
move on to something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I got that flow clone from my
friend in 2007 or eight ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine how many times I've had to
re-clone and re-mom this one cultivar over
[SPEAKER_00]: the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be at least 20 times if I've done
it every six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure it was more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it was more than that because
there were times when I've moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've moved different houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've moved different facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have taken it from the house where I
lived to the new house to the other house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took it from the house to the house
to a grow facility to another facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It performs exactly as I remember in all
of those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does the same thing since I got her in
2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else was growing her in 2007 and
gave it to me and it looks like the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that person grew it still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I've been skeptical of genetic
drift and I've played with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but since I'm writing a podcast,
I have to come at it unbiased and
[SPEAKER_00]: open-minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want my opinion to get in the
way of the opportunity to learn and also
[SPEAKER_00]: teach, so I did some Google research to
open my mind and I totally rattled my
[SPEAKER_00]: current opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a wonderful article on
cannabisindustryinstitute.com by a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: named Randy Robinson about genetic drift
and I wanted to share what I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article says, The true concept of
genetic drift started in the 1920s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was several decades after Darwin had
already revolutionized biology with his
[SPEAKER_00]: theory of evolution, but scientists still
didn't know how certain traits were passed
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some clues from Mendel's peace
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, but Mendelian genetics and
Darwinian evolution hadn't been combined
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 20s, biologists recognized that
certain genes and traits changed a
[SPEAKER_00]: population without any adaptive or
environmental pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we need to make a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biologists recognized that certain genes
and traits changed a population without
[SPEAKER_00]: any adaptive or environmental pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, let's say there are two types
of the same bird species on an island,
[SPEAKER_00]: some with silver feathers and some with
gold feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color of their feathers confers no
special survival advantages and the colors
[SPEAKER_00]: don't harm the birds either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these colors are neutral mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: After studying these birds for several
years, we noticed that the ratio of silver
[SPEAKER_00]: feathered birds to gold feathered birds
begins to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be a ratio of one silver to
one gold, but now it's ten silvers to one
[SPEAKER_00]: gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing happened on the island that should
have selected one color of bird over the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happened randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is known as genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, population geneticists refer to
genetic drift as sampling error.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that happens with
real-world populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: No sampling is ever perfect and that's
what we're seeing with genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sampling error happens over and over
again until it's amplified and becomes the
[SPEAKER_00]: most prevalent, or in some cases,
the only gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does genetic drift have to do
with cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably nothing because, pay attention to
this part, genetic drift only applies to
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of organisms that produce
sexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about cloning
cannabis, we're dealing with only one
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we may produce thousands of
copies of that individual plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still only one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetic drift does not apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, all this time we've been
saying genetic drift from cloning,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not even possible because genetic
drift only applies to populations of
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that reproduce sexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are not doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sexual reproduction here,
so that can't even apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift is not even a label that can
be applied to this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're going to change some
things today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was not my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our friend Randy and this article
that wrote this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question of why all of plants clones
aren't 100% the same is not easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, mainly because we haven't studied
cannabis as much as we'd like,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in large scale grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the research was performed in labs
on lower potency plants and small sample
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have taken a ton of research
on other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible that clones are themselves
producing new genes or deleting old genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2011, a study from Oxford
University showed that no clone was a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic analysts showed that when genes
regenerate new tissue, they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneously create new genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: When genes regenerate new tissue,
they tend to spontaneously create new
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been confirmed whether or not
cannabis does this, but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Oxford study called the phenomenon
regenerative mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some genes would be duplicated in the
process while other genes were deleted
[SPEAKER_00]: from the clone altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this study looked at the Thale
Crest plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as similar as regenerative mutation
and genetic drift may seem, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that thing we've been calling genetic
drift, you guys, we have got to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: word I think that is more appropriately
known as regenerative mutation is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward with this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says another reason we may see changes
in some clones is stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress doesn't change the genetic makeup
of a clone, but it can change how its
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are expressed through a process
called epigenetics, a relatively new field
[SPEAKER_00]: of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last few decades, we realized
that DNA and genetic expression are not
[SPEAKER_00]: set in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experiences of a parent can change the
way their DNA is expressed and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: pass those changes on to their offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epigenetics may explain why people who
experience severe trauma, such as war,
[SPEAKER_00]: might beget children who are more prone to
disease and mental illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stress changed the way the parent's
genes were expressed and those changes
[SPEAKER_00]: were passed on to their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the DNA itself didn't change,
but little control mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as chemicals produced by the body,
changed whether those genes were turned
[SPEAKER_00]: on, off, or set to overdrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these stress culprits and our
cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a mother plant just gets old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes her feeding cycle is changed or
she gets sick or injured or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers suspect the heavy use of
synthetic fertilizers or hormones may
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenetically alter their mothers,
causing the clones to lose some desired
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to making clones,
remember this, the act of cloning is a
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful act.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're damaging tissue by severing part of
the plant from its self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones also get transplanted and
transported all over the place,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can induce stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this happens, dozens if not hundreds
of times to a series of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may end up with different qualities in
our clones than we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that article was from
cannabisindustryinstitute.com by Randy
[SPEAKER_00]: Robinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys learned as much as I did
because I thought that article got right
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It taught me a lot and I really enjoyed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't say genetic drift anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because genetic drift only happens in
something that produces sexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new word is regenerative mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenerative mutation, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop that one in the clone room tomorrow
when you're working and watch the lead
[SPEAKER_00]: grower look confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch him look intimidated like,
gosh, this guy knows more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, they mentioned the
phrase sampling error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from people taking shitty clones or
taking clones improperly or improper care
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants or taking a clone from an
unhealthy mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sampling error and also another
cause for what we used to think was
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to call it regenerative
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a new conversation in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with that tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we thought we were seeing may be
happening, but we were just identifying it
[SPEAKER_00]: incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not genetic drift,
but a regenerative mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume the health of the donor
plant, the stress and experience of
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning, the environment, it's all got a
lot to do with this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still suspect most of what we see is
grower error or plant reaction to poor
[SPEAKER_00]: stress or poor environment or poor cloning
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or unclean cloning area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a vapor pressure deficit
issue or pest or pathogen issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not some sort of shock during the
cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically, we're grabbing a plant and
we're amputating the arm and we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it regrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we give a lot of opportunity for
problems during cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I cut off your arm in the clone
room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about wherever you take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just going to grab a giant fucking
knife and I'm going to cut your arm off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now would you feel clean and safe with an
open wound in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you cool with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be like, yeah,
this is totally sanitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and set my arm on that table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that table where you set your
clones, do you think that's cool for your
[SPEAKER_00]: freshly amputated arm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's going to be all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, would you want me to cut
your arm off while you're feeling strong
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you a month to work out and
get fucking tough to where when you cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: off, you still got some strength to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could get it stapled back on or
something and we can get it to regenerate
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're still young and you're
still healthy and you just got super
[SPEAKER_00]: strong and you've been eating well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want us to wait till you're 90
years old and cut your arm off and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: super glue and staple that bitch back on
when you're using most of your energy just
[SPEAKER_00]: to live because you haven't been eating
well and your body's all frail by now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about where the clones come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to prevent regenerative
mutation is to keep healthy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your clones from healthy mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a sterile cloning area and a solid
cloning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write some SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go read some cloning techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put out another cloning podcast very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one out already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on putting out a revised cloning
episode here in just a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see your mother plant getting
weak, cut some clones right away for
[SPEAKER_00]: safekeeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see her looking shitty,
just take a few clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always pulling clones off of plants
all the time anyway, just to have fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants, just to keep the cycle
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I know that I'm going to want a
whole bunch of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll cut like four clones of that and
I'll veg those out to get them kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll take all my clones off of
those four and they just become
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificial plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die, but then I've got tons of clones
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get good at cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get good at identifying problems in your
mother plants and have timing and know
[SPEAKER_00]: when that mother plant's starting to burn
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have to be able to tell if
you've got issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have russet mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something eating at the roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a problem making that mother
plant get tired?
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it looks like she's healthy and
she's just burning out on you,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone off of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some plenty of clones and then get
those clones rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them under a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get those back to super health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then clone off of those for your next
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're doing the clone off your
veg plants, clone off your veg plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone off your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure your veg plants are super
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean if you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow your veg plants right before you
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a couple clones off of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those become the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put everything into flower except your
little clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those become the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a couple clones off of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys understand how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how a lot of perpetual grows
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you're not going to get problems
if you do things correctly, if you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take a long time to cause
regenerative mutation problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my report on
genetic drift now known as regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
