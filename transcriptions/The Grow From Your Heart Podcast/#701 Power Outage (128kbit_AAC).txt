[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's not ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to talk too much about myself my
life in this show, because some people do
[SPEAKER_00]: find it boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get comments that the first
five minutes of this show was nothing but
[SPEAKER_00]: rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of my friends do enjoy hearing
about what's going on in my life and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying what I've experienced to me
sharing that with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to bring my friends in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's story time with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently got to experience an amazing
place called Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three Meow Wolf locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a New Mexico location,
a Las Vegas location and a Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Denver location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meow Wolf is an amazing place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called the Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convergence is what it is known as at that
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convergence Station might be the real
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really describe what happens
inside of Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meow like what a cat says, and wolf like
the animal Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an interactive art experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it is like walking into a
mushroom trip inside of a building is the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest, best way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meow Wolf is an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for two hours, I got there at
10 o'clock, they closed at midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They politely kick you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a get the fuck out
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're like, hey, Convergence is
closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that two hours, I missed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I know I missed a lot is
because I've seen other social media posts
[SPEAKER_00]: and other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't see a lot of the shit in
those videos and a lot of the things in
[SPEAKER_00]: those posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's a lot more of that place
to explore, discover, interact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time I go, I will buy the little
cue card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing experience without the cue
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you buy this little thing called
the cue card, there are places where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can tap the card and more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place comes to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the whole place is interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you walk by touch has some sort
of user interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you walk into one area, and there are
doorways, and there are hidden doorways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just looks like the wall,
I would push on certain parts of the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would open up and there'd be a
mirror maze in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come out of the mirror maze,
now you're in some weird pizza land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come out of pizza land,
and now you're in the catacombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come out of the catacombs,
and you're in some weird fairy land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I can't do it justice by
explaining it with words.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had such a good time, I had to share
it, I had to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a fully immersive, interactive,
psychedelic art experience, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: spend hours in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have fun when you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denver place is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that the Albuquerque place is
just as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reviews I have read and things I've
heard the Las Vegas location is not as
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive, but still amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to share with you guys the
fun experience that I had at Meowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will quit rambling about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis consumer,
if you've got a brain like me,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're into art, creativity,
experiences, anybody of all ages can go
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available for all ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to carry the small kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go during the day if you got little ones,
because at night, people may or may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: not in their totally right mind,
unless you want your kids around some
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are gooned out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to go a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do also offer days, nights,
which are adults only.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 6 p.m., you do have to be 21 to get
in on some dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do announce that on their calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to buy tickets in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I just did a fucking Meowth
Wolf commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not what that was supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get paid for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply enjoyed it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share the experience with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was led by someone who's already been
there and they knew right where to take
[SPEAKER_00]: me, right what to show me, like they had
already been in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one room in Meowth Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you've dumped my brain on
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's enough of a Meowth Wolf
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you to alter yourself,
but if you alter yourself, it will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: most amazing experience you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're somebody that doesn't alter
yourself, that place is kind of what it
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like to be altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're walking around in somebody's
mushroom trip when you were inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on from Meowth Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I gave them a big commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meowth Wolf, I'll look forward to the free
tickets in my inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 710 episode is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not 710 the month, not 710 the holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode number 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is number 701.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is nine episodes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is the concentration celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain why on the episode,
but 710 is the new time to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you take dabs when you smoke
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will give you a hint of why we
say 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the 710 episode is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like questions from the audience
and the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got dab questions,
concentrate questions, 710 questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get those questions
because I do plan to have a very well
[SPEAKER_00]: known, very reputable concentrate maker
here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that grows their own flowers and
presses, makes rosin out of those flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and is very well known for their
impressive, delicious rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of a lot of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smoke Green Dot and I'll smoke rosin
from this other person and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, but I'm going to have a
great concentrate maker, rosin presser,
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, member of the community here on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be able to answer a lot of the
concentrate questions or what I cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends that I do plan to have on the
show will answer those for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do invite you to send me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to all of your concentrate
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's about dabbing, dab equipment,
concentrates, we won't talk about making a
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't talk about making things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to do to focus on is how
every home grower can safely and legally
[SPEAKER_00]: produce their own concentrates at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm rambling and stoned
obviously today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend who got me the
cake batter dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is working, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions for the 710 show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate questions, hash questions,
concentrate questions, dabbing questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to get them on episode
number 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if I don't use those questions for
episode 710, I'll just use them for a an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can answer them on my own,
I'll handle them, field them myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So load me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash questions, concentrate questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: This show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that this will be the podcast
that comes out right before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this will come out right before
Christmas, just the day before Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: Eve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make sure to wish everybody
whatever holiday it is that you celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever holiday you are going to
celebrate this winter, your cold season
[SPEAKER_00]: holiday, your winter holiday, your excuse
to take some time off work off a school
[SPEAKER_00]: and spend time with your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have the best winter holiday
season that you can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow down for a minute, unplug for a
minute, turn off tick tock, spend some
[SPEAKER_00]: time with some people that you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be your blood family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your sneaker head family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your skateboard family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your band family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your gang family.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you've been to do,
be with your family, spend some time,
[SPEAKER_00]: unplug for a minute, spend some peaceful,
loving, caring time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recharge yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we get moving fast, especially me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work eight days a week, 26 hours a day,
42 days a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's like to go fast,
try to get a lot of shit done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's the time of year to take a break,
hug somebody, eat some good food,
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange some gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if those gifts are just your company,
be around each other, chill out,
enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my point of this was, I don't care
what holiday you celebrate, I still love
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every color, race, creed, orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for that love right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spread the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into the actual part of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambling here at the start of
the show is gonna be a nine hour show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even talked about any of the
main topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new year is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's more episodes before the new
year, but it is time to start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about what are we going to do with
ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the new year, it's always time to have
a start for a fresh start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're changing that calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get your goal of how
many?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many harvests are you going to get
next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you figured out how to set a rhythm
of how many harvests you expect in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to set goals,
not just in your grow, but in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got about two weeks now to clean all
this shit up in your life that a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half clean up all the bullshit,
get it straightened up so we can start
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set some goals in your grow,
set some goals in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to be better at next
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to learn how to clone
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get better at
defoliating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to learn how to finally take
clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said clones already, but you know what
I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to improve on next
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in your life, what are you going to
improve on?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I keep saying is that
I'm going to be better at answering
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try my best to respond and interact with
all the emails that I get, but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: overloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my new year's resolutions again
is to answer all the damn emails as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you email me and I keep looking at my
phone right now, as I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving myself a panic attack and
anxiety, I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you email me and I don't
reply, it's not personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you reply and people reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll reply to 100 emails in a day and I
get 100 responses and I'm not bitching,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my resolutions is to do better
at emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been emailing me,
maybe in the new year, I'll finally get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some goals for the new year in
the grow and in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be something big.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do something that you don't like
that you do, if you know you do something
[SPEAKER_00]: that sucks, do it one time less next year,
over 365 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the shitty thing one time less,
that is progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do something that you wish you did
more, everybody says they're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the gym, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say I want to go to the gym,
if you make it one day a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more than you were doing last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe work that up to two or three times,
but build onto things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a gym person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying build on things, improve this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next question is, what did you learn
this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you learn some stuff this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit back for a minute and think about what
you learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been through a lot of shit for the
past year, year and a half coming up on
[SPEAKER_00]: two years ish, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our minds, our bodies, our psychological
systems have been put through hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us our health has been put
through hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you come out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably had a lot of emotional,
spiritual, physical, psychological
[SPEAKER_00]: learning this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you deal with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to deal with a lot of
emotional things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was maybe not emotional, but I was used
to going to comedy shows and concerts
[SPEAKER_00]: every single weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for 18 months, I was stuck here in
this house.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I do with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I improve?
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned my audio podcast into a 4k multi
cam podcast that comes out twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's pretty well produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put out a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I tried to learn and do with
my, my year, my handy time, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: my forced stay at home vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did you learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to learn next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already said get better at something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to learn next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you learned this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you can do with the next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get too philosophical,
but a lot of people forget that sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to sit down, reflect what did you
learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to check in with
yourself, check in with your business,
[SPEAKER_00]: check in with your life, your grow,
just get a good grip on some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got some loose ends you haven't
thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be time to clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start a new year fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success is something
that I say a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've ever given credit on
the show to who taught me the phrase set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was seventh grade at
Bellflower High School in Bellflower,
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Miss Dodson is who taught a
class called success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was set yourself up for success was
one of the phrases that she said a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might not believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you'll believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a speech in her class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a Christmas show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry motherfucking Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I gave a speech in her class,
we had to give speeches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody at the time did like Michael
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was Mark McGuire and Jose
Kinseko were popular at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody did those people as their
heroes, we had to do a speech on our
[SPEAKER_00]: heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember who the girls did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, ladies, I don't remember who the
girls chose to do their speeches about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the boys chose Michael Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy did Wayne Gretzky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember Jose Kinseko and Mike Mark
McGuire was the home run derby time is
[SPEAKER_00]: when this speech had to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did my speech in seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Miss Dodson looked at me at the end of
my speech and said, I've never given
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody an A on a speech before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, I just got the first
day on a speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: She set me up for success, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this far into life, I'm successful
because that lady made me give a good
[SPEAKER_00]: speech and give me confidence in myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll always remember set yourself up
for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you could do that in the grow in
your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a stoner, have your keys and
your wallet and your phone ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got to remember to take something
tomorrow, set it by your phone or by your
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes or by your keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small shit will lead to big shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling getting all philosophical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody came here for all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys came here for a cannabis growing
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, a lot of people have experienced
power outages all over social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see my power is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The power has been out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power is going to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power is flickering.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we deal with power outages?
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a decent area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of infrastructure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the power goes out here, they're
usually pretty quick on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in my neighborhood in the past couple
of weeks because of the extreme wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: we experienced 90 mile an hour winds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power did go out several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are asking me, emailing me and
posting it on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we deal with these power outages
this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do have a few things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us may have multiple cycles of
plants in our grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones and the easy cloner are going
to need the most attention when the power
[SPEAKER_00]: goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about keeping those clones
happy and safe when the power goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about the rest of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work our way through the rest of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running your clones in an easy
clone or some type of turbo cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroponic cloning machine, those clones
expect their roots, their base,
[SPEAKER_00]: their tips to be wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe constantly, at least every few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people run that sprayer constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run mine on a 45 minute on, 15 minute
off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll do it differently based on
the environment, availability and needs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time it's 45 minutes on,
15 minutes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them wet, keep them wet,
turn off that sprayer, let them not dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of not be soaked for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't get root rot that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dry time is when the roots really
start spreading out looking for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep some moisture on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let it turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when the power goes off, that sprayer
inside the easy cloner, the turbo cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever aeroponic clone machine you're
using, it's not going to spray those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a couple of hours, they're going to
start saying, depending on their age,
[SPEAKER_00]: how far along they are in the process,
they're going to start telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we need some water on our roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest thing to do for the easy
cloner is to get a spray bottle like the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind used to clean the windows or
whatever, get a clean one, buy a clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh spray bottle, designate it for
purposes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got one to use for foliar
feed that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoop up some of the water out of the easy
clone machine and spray the roots of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with that water every hour,
every 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they stay wet, they will not
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to keep those roots wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just moisten them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to be soggy and dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more frequently you can do it,
obviously the better, but you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: lift up that dome, spray them,
spray down those roots, get every single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, get them wet, then close it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't crush any of the roots
if you've got dangly roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do this, here is, we're going to
talk about this more later on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, but when you do this,
make sure that you put that cloner back
[SPEAKER_00]: together properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we'll set that clone dome
back on top, the top of the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the dome, it's just the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set that top back on there and it
won't be perfectly on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the power does come back on,
the water is going to spray everywhere out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that fucking cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are notorious for leaking if
you don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a piece of a neoprene, an extra
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you buy the clone collars,
the little circles, they come in like a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray and a little tray thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the thing that a six pack of
beer or soda would come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep part of that and I cut shapes out
of that to stick in the holes of my easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner because they provide you extra
holes for more plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put a heater, an air stone,
some random shit, there are more in and
[SPEAKER_00]: out spots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that neoprene to cut little plugs,
I guess, to fill those, to plug the dam so
[SPEAKER_00]: there are no leaks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be really important to make
sure to reassemble that easy cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: completely correctly and anticipate the
power coming back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when the power comes back on,
that thing is going to start spraying from
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not on there correctly,
the water will spray out of the gaps,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea how many times I've come
home or walked into a commercial facility
[SPEAKER_00]: and just heard and that easy cloner is
just empty and all the water is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor and the pump is just cooking itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell the pump about to burn and
fry itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to think about when the
power goes out is that easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the clones in the easy cloner
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got regular clones, you're going
to need to keep that space warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in the winter like it is right
now, it may get cold quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to figure out a way to keep
the babies warm because that coldness is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be one of the first things that
destroys the small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer too much cold for the
larger plants compared to too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the babies at this point,
the cold will really slow down the success
[SPEAKER_00]: and health of your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got a dome, keep them warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing you can ask for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them alive until the power comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a short power outage,
this won't be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the power is out for a long time,
that's when we start getting stressed out
[SPEAKER_00]: on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that because the
plants of course are photo period plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: long periods of dark can give us problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we have addressed the easy
cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move our way into the veg area
and talk about the plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg plants can handle the power
outages quite well because they are just
[SPEAKER_00]: vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They expect 18, maybe 20, maybe 24 hours
of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people do something different,
but they just expect a long day of
[SPEAKER_00]: daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the power goes out in your veg room
during your daytime cycle, those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: simply think it was cloudy or it was a
rainy day and they just didn't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: light, the photons, the sun energy,
the light energy that they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten for that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for one day, for a few hours in veg,
it shouldn't cause you too many problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll miss that much that many par watts,
that many photons, that much PPFD for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't go to the gym that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get its vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't eat that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of, it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a couch day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a cheat day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lazy day is what that plant did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had lights off for just a short
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to segue from veg plants to
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that it matters in the flower
room more is because these plants are what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are growing auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm about to say kind of doesn't
matter as accurately as much for auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cannabis plants are flowering is
induced by triggering a light cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 12 hours of light,
12 hours of uninterrupted darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our veg plants are in dark for too
long, they can be triggered to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could take 24, 48, 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant will have a different critical
period in which it will decide to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower from darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is up to each individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be possibly phenotype dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely it's going to be strain
dependent, depending on where your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are from, depending on how far along those
plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're root bound, if they're more
mature, if their hormones are built up and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ready to go into flower,
it may take less darkness for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got small plants that are in big
pots and they're not root bound and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been getting a lot of light,
they may not switch as quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be all about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of small details will play into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got veg plants and you are
experiencing power outages for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time, you may want to get some
sort of supplemental lighting in there
[SPEAKER_00]: just to wake them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use a powerful flashlight if
that's all you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a home grow, like a portable
one of those battery, not the small circle
[SPEAKER_00]: batteries, the big square battery powered
flashlight, that bitch will go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and wake your plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shine that at the plants every hour
for five or 10 minutes and just wake the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the flowering plants are more
critical because we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupt the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason those plants are flowering is
because they're getting 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of mess with the day cycle a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go in there every day
and just unplug the lights and plug them
[SPEAKER_00]: back in and just fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause them stress and confuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can disrupt, augment, mess around,
play with, torment them during the day
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle to a minimum without causing
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the power goes out during the light
cycle, it's just like they're not getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said a moment ago, they're not
getting their light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the main source of energy for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is what triggers everything else to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what tells them to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what creates photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything comes from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that light starts the whole process of
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the light, they're not going to do
their processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't die without light for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not going to make any
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not at the gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also not spending anything on the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably won't lose anything from
one, maybe two short power outages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't want it to be a regular,
consistent thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can interrupt the daytime cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you cannot do is have light problems
during the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot get lights interrupting our
sleeping process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's during the day, and I'm like,
hey, let's turn off the lights and watch a
[SPEAKER_00]: movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the lights, watch a movie,
play their phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights come back on, you're just
like kind of lazy, lethargic, good movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice cuddle time with the chick or
whatever with the dude if that's your
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're a lady or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come out of the dark time, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you go to bed, and halfway
through your bedtime, I turn on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and start fucking playing the
drums, you're going to be pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants, however, will express intersex
traits and produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly I'm not going to turn intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't turn intersex from a
light problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you don't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is what happens when you fuck
with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can take a light interruption
during their light time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could take a light interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take a dark interruption during
the dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck with them when they're
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're awake, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's segue into a very important part
of the power outage discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get everything back on track as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting if you know the power is
going to flicker, go off and on multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: times for the next few hours, maybe just
go unplug everything for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is less stressful on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you're not going to freak
out as much if you don't hear your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light going or your fans and your air
conditioners coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, so do the equipment, so do the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less stressful on you,
the plants and the equipment to just
[SPEAKER_00]: unplug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the light coming on,
depending on what kind of lights you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got old HPS lights, you don't
want those coming on running for 15 and
[SPEAKER_00]: then getting shut off and then coming back
on because that is a cold start,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very, very bad for the bulb and
the ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just unplug your gear if you know
you're going to have intermittent power
[SPEAKER_00]: outages for the next few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just unplug it, but make sure to get
everything back on schedule as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about every single fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an easy cloner on a timer,
readjust that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your lights are on a timer,
they come off and on at a certain time,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they are reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got those dialed timers,
you've got to manually return that timer
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the power went off on some timers and
it doesn't have a battery backup,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to reset the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many timers have an auto reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: On, off, auto button.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they come back on from a power
outage, they flip to the on switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put it back on auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not go off when you're expecting it
to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double check everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is plugged in and you expect it to
cycle in some sort of way, double check
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your fans, your air conditioners,
your dehumidifier, your humidifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: your humidistat, whatever comes on to get
rid of humidity in the room, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of that stuff has been reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running any sort of electronic
digital monitoring devices, recalibrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and relink with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a smart B, if you've got a
PL grow system, if you've got a what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: other brand of pulse, make sure that is
all recalibrated, reconnected and reset so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know you're getting your
notifications and your alerts and that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when those things get unplugged,
they lose their connection to your phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: your modem, your device, your router,
your gateway, whatever century you live
[SPEAKER_00]: in, whatever you call it, wherever you
are, you may need to reconnect your
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as possible, get all of your
stuff back on cycle because it is like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said earlier, it is less critical to keep
your dark cycle on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to get your dark cycle
back on time, make sure nothing's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come on during that night cycle that you
don't think is going to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all your timers synced back up,
get all of your blowers synced back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything needs to be checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said a minute ago, if you think
you're going to keep experience in more
[SPEAKER_00]: power outages, if the wind is still
blowing, if the snow is still coming down,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the trucks are still out there working
on it, just leave that shit unplugged
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is more stressful on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine if like you took a nap and
every couple of hours are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: psych, we're turning the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, shit, man, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like torture for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be torture for the plants as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stress them, intersect
them, give them any more struggles than
[SPEAKER_00]: they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know the power is going to keep
flickering and problems are going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, just unplug everything,
let it all chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just resting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you get some light on them
within the next 18 hours or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants won't go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need a couple of hours,
maybe a few minutes of light if that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep doing that every few hours to
keep them from going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is better to have too cold than too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a story of a power outage for
several days in Canada and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, their crops did survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as you are certain that
everything is restored, the power crew is
[SPEAKER_00]: gone, the wind is gone, the snow is
starting to melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in the grow, start in the flower room,
start in the bedroom, work your way up or
[SPEAKER_00]: down, however you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But check everything that is plugged in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every light, every timer, every fan,
every blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, all of your
electronics, all of your monitoring stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have cameras in the grow that are
connected to your Wi-Fi, they may need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be reconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on all of that stuff before you
leave, before you go anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: before you head out for work again,
before you go to the friend's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you get there, you're going
to want to check your VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to look at the grow
and you're going to go, ah, I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking recalibrate the cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't redo the PL minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of my shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go home because I'm paranoid
about my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there, reset all your timers,
reprogram everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights are supposed to go off,
don't have faith that they went off,
[SPEAKER_00]: go in there and actually physically check.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a timer set for 10 p.m.,
set an alarm on your phone for 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's 10 p.m., go look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the lights go off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there light coming from under the door,
from out of the tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear the blower that you're
supposed to hear?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a fan that should come on at
one time, go check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check for just a couple of cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you got your rhythms back in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got rambly on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me recap and then we'll wrap up
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are experiencing power outages,
make sure the most important thing is to
[SPEAKER_00]: get everything back on track as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is OK to interrupt the daytime cycle on
a cannabis plant because it is a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not OK to interrupt the nighttime
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best to get those plants back on
their regular cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sometimes you'll just have to leave
them off for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change any timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything weird shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get them back to their regularly
scheduled program as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the power went off and then nighttime
came, just let them have that long day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that full night they would normally get
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever time the timer should come on,
get it back on schedule right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get right back to your program as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't confuse those plants any more than
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them back on their pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them back to class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them learning again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them back in the gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get back on schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can interrupt that daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't interrupt the nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you're going to get a lot of
interruptions, just unplug them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a long extended couple of days
without light, you do need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: something in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some light on those plants just to
wake them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're in flower, let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to mess with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will keep flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the water level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's dark doesn't mean
they're not going to need some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up while it's nice
and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas.
