[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I owe a huge shout
out to Martin Land for that opening track
[SPEAKER_00]: called Roast in Style 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great intro music.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally fits my vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, you know I like to
work on it for a couple of minutes and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you always got a bite into that thing
and then it's got like a gooey strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: texture in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what this concentrate
tasted like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great work, as always, to our friends
at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that makes a great segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dabs I was taking today were not my
normal dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were upgraded, fancy dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dabbing in style, extra classy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends at Happy Daddy, Happy Daddy
Products, sent me a very nice care
[SPEAKER_00]: package, which consisted of a new quartz
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also came with a dab insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we talked about insert dabs
recently on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about them again in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me the quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me this dope insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me some turp spinners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a really cool glob father two
dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a sweet carb cap to go with
the new banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a customized glob father two
dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a hat pin dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a key chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a plethora of great smoking
accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one of those grinder cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little card that you can carry in
your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it out and it works as a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a cheese grater for your
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great if you're trying to roll a
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a great care package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, huge thank you shout out to
my friends at Happy Daddy Products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my new nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the new carb cap and these dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what all started it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted one of these glob father two
dabbers and he's like, well, let me send
[SPEAKER_00]: you a package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just sent me a whole bunch of great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge shout out to my friends at Happy
Daddy Products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about these insert dabs a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've got my own insert dab set
up, I've had some time to play with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment and experience this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike said on Instagram today that it was
better than he expected and hit him harder
[SPEAKER_00]: than he had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like Mike likes the insert
dabs also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the main differences
between taking normal dabs and insert
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to start with the normal nail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we used to heat up a
titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a screw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a head on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had another piece on it that would
screw up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would fit in the joint of your rig or
bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed a male joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd either get a pipe or a bong or a
bubbler with a male joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't have a male, you'd get an
adapter that made it a male joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the nail would fit in that joint and
then a dome would slide over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heat up the nail, put the dome over
that, and then you touch the dab to that
[SPEAKER_00]: hot nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that dome would trap the smoke in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could smoke it through your pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll explain this joint part that I keep
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part where you put your bong bowl
into the bong, usually it's a hole and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bong bowl slides into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if they did that the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if the hole was on the bong bowl
and the male part was actually sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: off of the bong or the bubbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a little male joint sticking
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you slide this nail into there and
you use the screw part, the nut that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be on the screw, to adjust the height.
[SPEAKER_00]: The height of how far it sticks up out of
that joint so it doesn't go too high out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to put the dome on there and
you want to aim it to where the head of
[SPEAKER_00]: that nail is basically right in the center
height of the dome is what you'd aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we used to use a titanium
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it was titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then like I mentioned in the 710 episode,
Task Rock made the flux nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Task Rock made the domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Task Rock made the infinity nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It evolved quite heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then glass blowers got in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started using quartz or glass bangers
instead of titanium nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you go listen to my 710
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will teach you all the details on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started making what's called a
club banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with the club banger came the
evolution of our rigs where they started
[SPEAKER_00]: putting female joints on the rigs and
making the bangers themselves males.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little rigs were usually somewhere
between six and eight inches tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of wide based with the mouthpiece
coming up off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a spot to hang a nail on it and they
basically call it a banger hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all the rigs are available in males or
females depending on the artwork or the
[SPEAKER_00]: style of the rig or what you prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the joints are also available in males
or females and they're also available in
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 or 90 degree angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can get your nail,
you want them straight up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it horizontal with the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on what angle your joint comes
off of your rig, you need the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gotten it all customized by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured out that we would need males
and females we know what sizes we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get on to, we went to the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from titanium into the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The banger is, so my rig, my joint points
straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need a 90 degree angle on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a female rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my rig has a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fucking weird but it's got a
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nail, my banger is a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the joint slides right into the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight up then it turns at a 90
degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that 90 degree angle,
there is basically a large glass thimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be similar to a thimble or maybe
a really tiny shot glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of it is quite thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thicker than the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so that the bottom will retain
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sidewalls are fairly thick but not as
thick as the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pointer finger fits in here quite
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My middle finger fits in there kind of
snugly and it goes all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: first knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that gives you any idea of the depth
and the internal diameter is probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could stack dimes in here if you
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the size of the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I drop that right into the rig and
then I heat the bottom corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heat where the floor and the wall meet
because I want the heat to be focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom because it's real thick there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to retain the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the walls, I want to have some heat
also just to have that heat all around
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm going to use this radiant heat
to heat my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is where the difference between a
normal banger dab and an insert dab come
[SPEAKER_00]: into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of ways to do these
insert dabs and I'll talk about them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before we had insert dabs,
we would heat this banger fairly hot and
[SPEAKER_00]: then let it cool to our desired
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes a different temperature on
their dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know by now I go hotter than
most folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks like them nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get a q-tip and clean half your
dab out of the banger when you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much left when I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we would normally do it,
we'd heat that banger, let it cool to the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your hand or whatever to judge how hot
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your dab on the end of a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You press it into the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the dab all falls off the dabber,
use a carb cap to cap that banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carb cap traps the air that's in
there and it reduces the pressure inside
[SPEAKER_00]: that banger vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reduces the airflow allowed to go
over the hot oil to where when you pull
[SPEAKER_00]: air over that oil, that fresh air stokes
the heat and makes your oil evaporate at a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not getting a super hot dab and
it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let it cool, put the dab in there,
put the carb cap on and keep hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes super good and you get a
nice fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're done, you got a little
oil left in there, you get a q-tip and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe that banger out and then you're
pretty much good to go on another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where it branches off and gets
different when we're doing insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this, so I described the original
banger as looking like a thimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another smaller thimble that fits
right inside of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that you could fit a dime inside of
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's probably the size of like
four dimes, five dimes deep stacked up,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe six dimes stacked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just little, little tiny glass dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put your dab inside of there or
the amount of concentrate that you wish to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke inside of this little dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just scoop out like one good size
crystal and drop a little crystal inside
[SPEAKER_00]: this dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you heat the banger and that's,
I, again, I heat it where the wall and the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor meet at the corner, the bottom
corner of the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want that heat to move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All around the whole nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it fairly hot because I need that
radiant heat to heat this dab that is
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's heated, I carefully take this
dish that's got my dab in it and I drop it
[SPEAKER_00]: right inside of this banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold it by the mic and do it and you
can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little sticky, so it didn't slide
as well as it should, but it just dropped
[SPEAKER_00]: right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say I heated it, heated the shit
out of it till it was hot, not orange hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just before orange hot, drop that
little insert in there with the dab in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, then set the carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wait, I just wait just a couple
of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, if I dropped it in here right
now while it's hot, we'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: doink, drop it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll go ahead and put the carb
cap on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, carb cap is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait till about now you would see
the dab start reacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the dab would really be bubbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would start hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm getting, instead of taking
that dab and pressing it up against the
[SPEAKER_00]: super hot surface and scorching it,
and making it cook right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is slowly coming to temperature where
it can vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using that radiant heat of the outside
glass to suck that heat through the carb
[SPEAKER_00]: cap over that dish inside there with the
oil in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brings that temperature up really
slowly and it makes that oil evaporate or
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporize at a much lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it taste so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it slowly comes up to temperature
where I can, it starts off with a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a thin, thin vapor smoke dab, but it
starts, as it goes, it gets to that thick
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed there is very little
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm not scorching the dab on that
hot nail right away, there's hardly any
[SPEAKER_00]: waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am getting all of the dab that I put in
this dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting a lower temperature dab
because I'm starting to smoke it at its
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest vaporizing temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when it starts going, I start
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see when it's bubbling inside that
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I start hitting it and I'm getting
all those turps that normally would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been burned off when I pressed that dab
against the hot banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting all those turps and I'm
also getting that fat chunky dab that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting the low temp flavor and I'm
getting all the cannabinoids and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that fat, thick smoke that I
appreciate from my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heat it up and I drop that dish in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set the carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it just so you can watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see when the earl just starts
puddling in the middle of that dish and it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts boiling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you want to hit it and then
spin that carb cap around and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: it move the oil around inside there and
move it to the hotter spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make it even out and it makes a puddle
less deep so it could burn better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really like the way it brings it up
to temperature instead of just right at
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings it up to the temp and then it
keeps going up because that heat's trapped
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you smoke it, it's heating up that
oil longer and hotter and hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it taste great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super lit off of it and my banger
isn't ridiculously dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I've got to do now that it's cooled
off, I can reach right inside of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pull this little insert right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll drop this insert into a
dish of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably due about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three or four good dabs,
I can't get it all the way clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got a big thick dab, I can't get it
all the way clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just drop it in a dish of ISO,
let it sit for a couple of minutes and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I pull it out and use a paper towel
and or a Q-tip just to polish it up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're ready to take dabs again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way that I've been doing the
insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike likes to take little tiny dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike came over the other night and I
was like, if I take the dabber and wipe
[SPEAKER_00]: the dabber off into the dish that I was
going to give Mike, there's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: enough content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to concentrate in here until it
doesn't look like there's anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how this is going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really, I'm not making fun of
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes tiny dabs, but it didn't seem
effective to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heated the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw the insert in there and then I put
Mike's dab on the dabber and had him just
[SPEAKER_00]: dab that into the inside of the dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him not to hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew to hit the inside of the dish and
not the banger itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made his dab burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burned more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't just, it didn't singe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just melted nice and smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he carb capped it and he got a
nice dab and Mike kind of went pale and
[SPEAKER_00]: his eyes went a little glossy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like marbles on his head for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another great way to utilize the
insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you let it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, you just reach in there
and pull it right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your banger isn't dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an insert that you can clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bunch of people that want
to come dab in a group, maybe think about
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of inserts because the only time
consuming part is really cleaning the
[SPEAKER_00]: inserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we've gotten to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it makes my dabs more
efficient, more effective, more flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, shout out to my friends at
Happy Daddy because I did not ask for an
[SPEAKER_00]: insert banger and an insert dab insert,
but they hooked me up and I'm really glad
[SPEAKER_00]: they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been talking
about dabs for like 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a fresh bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take about four fatty dabs
and then I'll be back to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging
out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some dabs of some stuff called
Whammy Bar Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strains are lemon essence and papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as honeysuckle,
lemon candy and lemon candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if lemon candy wasn't enough,
they threw in more lemon candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely got the honeysuckle flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon was just hinted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminded me of like a sweet
girly tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had a celestial seasonings tea
that had sort of a honeysuckle hint to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a lemony sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what it reminded me of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high went straight to my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of feels like I'm wearing
snowboard goggles or heavy sunglasses or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They named the strain headband because
when they smoked it, they said it felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like they were wearing a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had something around their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could totally rename this strain to
like scuba goggles or snowboard goggles or
[SPEAKER_00]: 3D glasses or something like that because
it went right to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it right in my face immediately and
the taste is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrates as always from Green
Dot Labs and of course they do not pay me
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by them by any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get any deals from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really approve of this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to them and I like to let
you guys know what I am smoking on a
[SPEAKER_00]: little look into my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of a little look into my world,
I was on Instagram live today and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a thank you for the episode with
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said thanks for pulling back the
curtain and letting us peek behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: curtain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They meant that we were talking about the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and I of course have been in the
legal cannabis industry since its
[SPEAKER_00]: inception here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking a lot about the legal
cannabis industry and its evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a listener say thank you for
peeling back the curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thank you again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it and I'm glad you guys
enjoy the insight sort of the view into
[SPEAKER_00]: our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I forget that you guys may be in
a state that doesn't have legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or you may not be able to find cannabis or
concentrates and you are living
[SPEAKER_00]: vicariously through me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep you guys updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep you guys included and I try
to have fun with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for hanging out and I hope you
enjoy the updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm awful rambly after those
dabs, but we are going to make this happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue this flow kind of segue into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Jesse was here, we really were having
a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got really into our conversations and
there were a few things that I missed that
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to cover in that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just real quickly, I want to recap a
couple of things that I missed on the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the last episode was based on a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me, why is it so difficult
to set up a grow indoors when it happens
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally by itself outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Jesse and I had a lot of
information to give on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main piece of advice was it doesn't
just happen naturally outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may look like it because you don't see
us out there all day, but when the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: comes up, we're already out there
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing any defoliation that needs to
be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking care of the garden before the
peak of the sun in the middle of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least we're trying to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of shit to be done
outdoors and outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could throw some clones out there,
some seeds out there and hope at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year, you get a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want a high quality garden,
you need to be out there every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of those plants, making sure
there's no pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do popping and twisting and
cracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here are a couple of things that I
missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing indoors, all of the pests that
are there, all of the bugs that are there
[SPEAKER_00]: were brought in by you either on your
clothes, on your shoes, or in another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you brought into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you brought clones home from a
dispensary or from a friend, those pests
[SPEAKER_00]: came there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's nothing there to combat those
pests because you only brought in those
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, if you get a small spider mite
infestation, something outside will come
[SPEAKER_00]: along and eat those spider mites and run
them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a couple of days, something's
going to come along and eat those and run
[SPEAKER_00]: them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside is always competing for territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to get as troublesome
and massive bug infestations as you are
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors because you're going to have some
sort of a balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outdoors has balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that balance is what makes it
so much easier to grow out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said in the other episode,
every time you add a piece of equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, you have to add another piece of
equipment to combat something that it
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a side effect that's not
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need another piece of equipment
and that piece of equipment has another
[SPEAKER_00]: side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add a light, it gets hot in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put an air conditioner in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to get too humid or too
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to add either a
humidifier or a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do something with
that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a whole bunch of more things to
add every time you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run CO2, you need to
rethink your whole ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just every time you add something,
there's more to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going with the stuff
that we missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors is naturally vented.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't add an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't add a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors is doing what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants can adjust because they're
not trapped in that room with no fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hot, but it is fresh hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the proper amount of CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants, there's wind and airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants aren't just sucking up that
stale, moist water that's coming up from
[SPEAKER_00]: the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water, all that water goes into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water starts evaporating up out of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moist air goes up all around your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just in there sucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the sauna all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, they can kind of regulate
because they're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just that same stagnant air all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's naturally vented outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about the pest balance and
we've talked about the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation, the natural CO2, the natural
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not trapped in there, breathing that
same funky stagnant air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the main factor that
contributes to amazing outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the sun is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without sun, nothing lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing exists without the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go for a little while,
but everything would go to shit on earth
[SPEAKER_00]: without the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun is the strongest, most powerful
resource for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is the main nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want light more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the number one nutrient
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing that your plants want
is light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more light you give them, the more
energy they have to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thicker the stalks can get,
the happier the leaves can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means the fatter your buds are going
to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the best source of light you
can imagine?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take your lumen meter and you can
put it outside in the sun and it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to max out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can carry your lumen meter over to a
shady spot and it's still so sunny outside
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not going to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much sun is outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can move your lumen meter a couple of
inches away from a grow light and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to show differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how strong the sun is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun gives those plants extra energy to
fight any problems that they may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got some bugs attacking them,
they're not as weak as the indoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been getting fed LED lighting or
even high pressure sodium lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to turn into electricity and
shoot down some wires and then send it to
[SPEAKER_00]: this bulb and hope that that bulb gives it
enough energy to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working just fine, but it is not
comparable to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is like putting it on performance
enhancing drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is what makes everything live,
you guys, all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cultures that worship the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put those plants outdoors,
if they're getting a little bug infested,
[SPEAKER_00]: first off, the other bugs are going to
come and fight them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got spider mites, some other bug
is going to go, oh, hey, bro, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of little spider mites over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go fucking eat them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those other bugs are going to go
eat those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully those bugs don't eat your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they do, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other bugs are going to go,
hey, bro, there's a bunch of these bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: over here looking like a bunch of bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those bugs are going to go eat those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to get bored and
they're going to ramble on and look for
[SPEAKER_00]: more bugs to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that's going to happen,
the bugs are going to eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, they're going to be much
more healthy because they're outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are getting the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much healthier do you feel when you go
spend a day outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not feeling good, if you got a
runny nose, if you got a cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're sneezing, you just go sit in the
sunshine for a little while and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: cook that shit out of you and you will
feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often have you been bummed out and
depressed or pissed off?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go lean against a tree and sit in
the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is fucking magic, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes the plants stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them a better self-defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them healthier overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one aspect of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another aspect is photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It heavily increases with all that natural
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's every ray that these plants want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything they naturally think they
should get is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not missing a certain spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are able to grow more
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can uptake their nutrients more
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can eat more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed them more because they
perform stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you've got Hussein Bolt out
there just fucking running as fast as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, he's going to need to eat a
little bit more than my scrawny ass who's
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting here at the fucking table all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be an indoor grow plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hussein Bolt would be an outdoor grow
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should say LeBron James is
probably more applicable today.
[SPEAKER_00]: LeBron is a fucking outdoor fucking hybrid
vigor fucking ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an indoor fucking yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just an indoor plant and you can see
the difference, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: LeBron will push me down and dunk on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would ask him for the ball so I could
maybe have a chance to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outdoor plants are getting those
sunshine rays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting so much stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're way healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to process their nutrients
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting all the cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little tougher because how tough
would you be if you had to sit out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and fucking deal with the morning dew
every morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just all cold and funky and moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, God damn it, I'm cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There ain't shit I can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sun starts coming up and you
just start getting hot and you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, fuck, I'm just getting
roasted now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish the fucking morning dew drops would
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the wind comes and starts bending
you over and whipping your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably like a squirrel climbed
up you or something or a goat peed on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the day went on, it got hot as
fuck and then the sun started going down
[SPEAKER_00]: and it got real windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got kind of cold to where you
wish as a plant, you wish you could go get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little plant hoodie because it's kind of
chilly out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that makes those plants that much
stronger and that much more robust and
[SPEAKER_00]: that much more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun and the outdoor just nature
just makes everything a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say it makes it easier,
but it definitely is a corrector.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make mistakes outdoors,
the sunshine will have so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiveness for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunshine will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant with problems,
that sun, just like a human, a depressed
[SPEAKER_00]: or sick human, the sunshine will be a
turbo boost to heal you and your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's mainly what I wanted to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Jesse was here, I did not think to
rant on how important the sun was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, you guys,
there are cultures that worship the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our entire solar system spins around the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be doing something,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to do something special to the
plants and you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why outdoor growing is completely
different than indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you have to deal with that sun while
you're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an indoor grow environment,
it's like 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the air conditioner blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too hot in there, I can just
not be in there for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the outdoor grow,
you're in the outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 107 degrees outside, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 107.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the downfall to the outdoor
growing is you've got to be out there
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to end or say anything
about the potency or the quality or the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference on which is better indoor or
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still going to be another debate
for another episode, but I wanted to add
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the things I left on why it's so
challenging indoors when it just happens
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I feel like I got that caught up,
let's read an email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say if they want me to say
their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get right into the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much from your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to get some useful info after
all these years of secrecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let you know that I really enjoy
the throwback Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can listen to you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm there with you guys laughing
and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to you and all of your great
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email and I'm glad
you were learning from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for listening to those Thursday
episodes because that was a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_00]: put those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you appreciate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, you are a crazy dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you could listen to me all
day, that's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, dude, thanks for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says big shout out to you and all of
your guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, okay, enough ass
kissing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been a gardener for a while now
and it still bothers me when it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like this guy has been
growing cannabis for quite a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when it's harvest time, it still
bothers him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little emotional attachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continues the email with, I was
wondering if it gets easier in a big grow
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have to cut down hundreds or do
you still have that special connection to
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think I would enjoy working
in a big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's more about production
than caring and nurturing a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you really care for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your harvest day like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thanks for the great podcast and
all of your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat ass dab for me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says from my iPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey dude, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there would like to send me
an email, my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's answer some of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, does it get easier when you have
to cut down hundreds or do you still have
[SPEAKER_00]: that special connection with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first time it was kind of
intimidating to cut down a giant room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut down 42 lights worth of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember the exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was close to 75 pounds of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first harvest in that
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little intimidating, but I don't
know that I had some sort of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh no, they're cutting down my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown for so long that I understand
that's the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the commercial grow, you're kind of
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about production at the commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about cutting them down,
cleaning the room, putting more plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, getting those plants to the dry and
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room paying attention to them every day so
that we can get them trimmed and dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's where you get to see the
reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, that weird feeling you have of
cutting them down, just think of that as
[SPEAKER_00]: one step closer to somebody with cancer or
seizures being that much closer to feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a way to kind of offset that
weird, uh, cutting down your baby sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have that feeling in the
commercial grows anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like, uh, we've got a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a big team that,
uh, so we got a guy going through,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's three layers of trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a guy that goes through and cuts
the two bottom layers off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never cut that top layer off because it
goes all crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go through and clean out the two
bottom layers of net.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got a guy that comes through
and cuts the plants at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got another guy that'll come
through and pull those plants out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: net and then get them onto a tray or onto
like a little cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that little cart gets a bunch of
plants and it gets wheeled over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy weighing each plant,
shouting out numbers to either Mike or
[SPEAKER_00]: Ernie, excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy shouts out numbers to Mike or
Ernie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and Ernie put those numbers into a
spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that plant gets moved to a whole
nother area, the dry and cure area,
[SPEAKER_00]: or those guys hanging on the dry and cure
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a conveyor belt process at
harvest time in a big production facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be satisfied or enjoying
working in a big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not meant to be like a craft sort of
a hobby grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something, it is a production
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and you're right, it is more about
production, but it is all about nurturing
[SPEAKER_00]: and caring for a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touch every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defoliate each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lollipop each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crack every branch of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of love put into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just done more quickly and more
methodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't put on your favorite podcast and
kind of relax and get stoned and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogan and pop these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Rogan in the headphones or the
earbuds or whatever you're rocking,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're just cracking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, it is more of a high pace
sort of a production thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pace you work in a home grow and Jesse
even said it on an episode, the pace you
[SPEAKER_00]: work in a home grow would not pay the
bills in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a way different sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your question says, I know you really care
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your harvest day like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just told you that it's kind of like
Jason and Freddie going in there and just
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the same token, I also have a
private grow, a personal grow with six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got six in flower and six in veg
because it's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allowed 12 plants with my medical
marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a very small garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the garden where I put on Joey Diaz
or Joe Rogan or Doug loves movies or a tad
[SPEAKER_00]: Hussies podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll put on one of those shows and
I'll get my earbuds in and I'll get nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and baked and I'll go play with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the plants that I get to
really love and care for and nurture a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do love all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the large facility, but there's a lot
of them and you can't, you can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll remember, Hey, did you check that
one plant over in row three?
[SPEAKER_00]: That just keeps being a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we can identify, we'll have a
relationship with one plant if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: standing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my home grow, I can tell you which
plant is in each room and in which
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're in the flowering room,
there are six pots under one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell you if I numbered them one,
two, three, four, five, six, I could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you which plant is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that King Solomon is number four
because he's the first one in that front
[SPEAKER_00]: row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, I don't even want to tell
you that Clementine is in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine is about to get pollinated by
King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few other really cool things
in there, but yeah, I got another breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project going on and I can tell you each
plant that is in there and I can tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: like what has gone on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I cracked the sticks on it and
everything that it's been fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a huge difference between the
commercial grow and the personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a different relationship with the
commercial grow and the personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's like being in two different
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being in a death metal band
where all night long I've got to be just
[SPEAKER_00]: my feet are going and I'm intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I miss one beat, it's all fucked
and you just got to be going lightning
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I guess I got a reggae band for my
home grow where it's chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the songs are going to
sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to relax and everyone's going
to have a good time and what needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's like being in two totally
different bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having two totally different
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the difference between being in
a hugely successful band that plays the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepsi center or being in a band that plays
like the black sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's.
[SPEAKER_00]: A totally different environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those big Pepsi center gigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the sweat and the challenge of,
are we going to get this done?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to go a hundred miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you also enjoy those
little black sheep gigs where you know
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the audience and you can see
the whole crowd and you just get to smile
[SPEAKER_00]: and relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love them both, but I try not to get
too personally attached to the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hard things is when we decide
to get rid of a cultivar at the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be like, so we've been looking at
the numbers and this cut doesn't produce
[SPEAKER_00]: very much, or maybe it's not reaching up
to a lab testing expectations or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll end up getting rid of a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that hurts my feelings
because sometimes I really like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I try not to get too
attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get really excited when we get new
stuff in a commercial grow though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've been running the same genetics
and you're like, Hey, we just got
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff does get me excited,
but I try not to get too personally
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that is business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I keep the home grow,
the personal grow more like the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of more intimate and personal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not enjoy working in a commercial
growing facility, but you may learn a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that you could take home and
implement into your home grow that would
[SPEAKER_00]: make you more efficient and more
productive and more cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be worth the trade off and also
it's something you've got experience in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valuable for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will also make you appreciate that
home grow a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thanks for the great email.
