[SPEAKER_00]: all of the information you need is right
there on the screen and you know I do
[SPEAKER_00]: include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends and yes I will
put that information in the show notes
[SPEAKER_00]: properly the show notes properly and
correctly this time I will remember to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that thank you for the gentle and subtle
reminders all right where do we go from
[SPEAKER_00]: there let's just jump right into it I've
got a message from a previous episode in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last episode I talked about my strain
grateful dog I talked about an offshoot of
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog that is known as 77 if you
listen to the episode you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about if not give it a listen it's
the episode right before this titled
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog you might enjoy it this
question goes like this it came from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend old ball coach and it says can we
in the iry army expect anything from
[SPEAKER_00]: number 77 in the near future thanks for
what you do and then there's more it says
[SPEAKER_00]: don't read this part in the air so I won't
read that part thank you for that message
[SPEAKER_00]: I did read that part to myself big respect
nothing but love the answer to your
[SPEAKER_00]: question though is quick now I don't have
any plans for number 77 for any commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding releases sometimes I do make and
create projects that kind of stick around
[SPEAKER_00]: and they stay for myself for me to breed
with for me to work with 77 so far has
[SPEAKER_00]: been kept a secret kept in the the private
reserve in the vault if you will I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some things that I don't release I
have to have some things that I can use as
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding stock in the future if I release
everything you've got the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate everything in my lineup you could
possibly recreate everything that I've put
[SPEAKER_00]: out there if you acquired the right
strains did a little bit of homework did
[SPEAKER_00]: some research did some female hunting did
some matching you could make a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: line however I do have some things that
I've bred that I have never put out there
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got male plants that I've used that
I've never put out any of the seeds I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got female plants I've pollinated that
nobody has ever seen those crosses I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got kind of a secret arsenal my secret
weapons my hidden vault not everything
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it out so there are some things that
have been played with with 77 but nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: that will go out commercially in the
foreseeable future although the market
[SPEAKER_00]: changes my ideas change my opinions change
sometimes you notice that I I realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds have been sitting in the vault
and my secret stash and my private reserve
[SPEAKER_00]: for far too long and I begin to feel
guilty about that and I think those need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get out to some friends and I will put
those up make them available for people in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain avenues in certain places most
likely the discord server but that is how
[SPEAKER_00]: I end up getting rid of some stuff like
that sometimes so maybe eventually one day
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll decide that I've had some of those
number 77 cross to I'm not even gonna say
[SPEAKER_00]: what they've been pollinated by or anyway
we don't need to talk about that I almost
[SPEAKER_00]: almost decided to go up that route but
maybe one day I'll release some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 seeds through some of the avenues that
we do on discord or other things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: but right now there are no plans no
intentions that is one of my hidden gems
[SPEAKER_00]: secret vaults secret weapons private
reserves once everybody is tired of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these stuff that I'm putting out once King
Solomon runs his course and gets boring
[SPEAKER_00]: once the jack the ripper mail gets boring
once the blueberry cookies mail gets
[SPEAKER_00]: boring once the golden goat mail gets
boring so we've got a lot of stuff to run
[SPEAKER_00]: through then maybe we may play with some
of the stuff from 77 I've pollinated that
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple of things maybe in the
future all right now I'm just rambling at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point the quick answer no bro no
plans to put that one out to the public
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta have some private reserves some
secret stash all right let me cut myself
[SPEAKER_00]: off from a ramble and get to the next
email here in today's episode this one
[SPEAKER_00]: came from our friend how did they sign
this one this one came from Brian 420 big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to our buddy Brian 420 thank you
for the great message this one goes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit like this it says hey Rasta
Jeff I love your podcast you deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: well-structured accurate and free cannabis
knowledge and we appreciate it dude I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that compliment that's uh
basically exactly what I'm trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver structured cannabis content that
new growers pro growers that every grower
[SPEAKER_00]: can understand I want to entertain and
educate the guys in the trim room all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the guys in the lead of the growl
maybe even entertain the investors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: owners maybe even encourage and educate
some people who are just curious about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis what was the old phrase if you're
a new grower pro grower I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what we used to say old-school
smoker or new smoker or even just curious
[SPEAKER_00]: about the current state of cannabis some
shit like that that's what I used to say
[SPEAKER_00]: at the start of the show I want everybody
to feel included involved and participate
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody said that I do talk to you guys
like you've never grown before and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good thing because many of you
out there never have grown before but I
[SPEAKER_00]: also try to include subjects topics and
details that will keep even the most
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced seasoned veteran growers
entertained I'm rambling once again but
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to the show if you didn't know I
was gonna ramble you must be new here
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the compliment brother
that's where I'm headed it goes on it says
[SPEAKER_00]: I've received a pack of starstruck seeds
good selection I believe those are sold
[SPEAKER_00]: out in most venues I don't have any more
I'm not going to make any more so you were
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky to have those it says I've been
growing and just wanted to send you an
[SPEAKER_00]: update I appreciate that I also must say
that the phenol I have is perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: structured a perfectly structured plant
it's beautiful from the aroma to structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and resistance I can't wait to oh we're
gonna skip that I can't wait to send you
[SPEAKER_00]: some flower picks I thought you're gonna
say you're gonna send me flower wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna read that on the air it says can't
wait to send you some flower picks as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as try to self and reverse her with my
motivation phenol I've been working with
[SPEAKER_00]: our I had to change pages here so there's
a lot going on there he says that the
[SPEAKER_00]: starstruck plant is perfectly structured
that is part of why I selected it the star
[SPEAKER_00]: dog plant they worked with that was
beautifully structured it was one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite in the commercial grow I gave a
very nice structure very wonderful aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful bag appeal and like you said
here it was resistant to problems in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow we would experience a
myriad of problems throughout the seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd get mites powdery mildew there's
always something to learn how to battle on
[SPEAKER_00]: a new grow and the star dog just didn't
seem to get it that's part of why I
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to kidnap that plant and breed it
breed with it put it in my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program it was a great plant just the
original mom plant that's where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these traits are coming from is from that
original star dog then like I like to say
[SPEAKER_00]: arise King Solomon that dude is just the
fixer that is the turbocharger that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: sending it to training camp any plant you
put in the room with that it just went
[SPEAKER_00]: through a six-week camp and it'll come out
ready for fighting it's ready to make
[SPEAKER_00]: weight ready to tap a motherfucker out I
am rambling it's been a good day been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking all the good shit let me find out
where I am in this message I'm on page two
[SPEAKER_00]: so our friend has found a star dog fino
they love they're considering reversing it
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving it and crossing it with their
motivation phenotype they have been
[SPEAKER_00]: working with then it says keep up the
awesomeness ps a quick question this is
[SPEAKER_00]: where the fun part comes in does a plant
does a plant's structure change with
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity and then he says an example nodes
changing from growing across from one
[SPEAKER_00]: another to staggered node spacing I asked
because I've experienced something similar
[SPEAKER_00]: with a star-struck clone it looks
structurally different from the parent
[SPEAKER_00]: plant what do you think that's a very good
question Brian I've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different theories here a couple of things
that could be happening possibly my first
[SPEAKER_00]: question my first theory my first idea the
very first thing that comes to mind is
[SPEAKER_00]: where did you cut the clones from if you
cut it from the main meristem you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gonna get the symmetry the
symmetrical branching that was harder than
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked to say symmetrical branching
you'll get that from the main meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: however if you cut from some of the side
branches then maybe you'll get some shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe even the opposite on some plants
it kind of depends on how the plant grows
[SPEAKER_00]: but for most of my experience if you cut
the top you're gonna get the symmetry if
[SPEAKER_00]: you come from the sides you may get that
the opposites which you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: staggered node spacing is what you're
saying I think my first suspicion is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it would come from location in which those
plants those clones particular clones were
[SPEAKER_00]: cut I have no evidence of that I wasn't
there I didn't see anything I've got very
[SPEAKER_00]: little information to go on I've got about
a paragraph about three sentences here to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with so that is my first guess then
then let's just talk about some other
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon that could be happening there
phenomena phenomenon things that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening there I try to sound like a
professional sometimes I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell I'm even saying some other things
that we should keep in mind is just
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical expression has the room
changed is the environment different that
[SPEAKER_00]: could make a big difference in the way
that the plant grows I don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: that would necessarily change the the
staggered node spacing but that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a difference in the way that the
plant would grow in a different room I
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to talk about that because
that's a fun avenue to go down
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical expression if we took the
same plant and we cut ten clones and we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't take one out of the main Maristan
we took it from the branches all around
[SPEAKER_00]: the size we had ten beautiful clones we
gave them to ten different growers to put
[SPEAKER_00]: in ten different rooms we may see ten
wildly different results the flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look smell taste and affect us
all differently based on things in their
[SPEAKER_00]: grow first of all we've got so there's
like lights air water soil all that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about the light is probably our
first factor one person a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays will probably grow under an LED
some people are going to grow under
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halides somebody will grow
under an HPS light somebody's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow still under a fucking stolen street
light that they got from way back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day somebody's going to use some cheap-ass
blurple light somebody who's going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the most expensive fucking LED on the
market so that's lighting that's right
[SPEAKER_00]: there we've got so many variables the guy
using that HPS that he stole compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy using the super expensive LED he's
got that R switch on there so he's giving
[SPEAKER_00]: him far-red light way different effects
from those lights compared to these the
[SPEAKER_00]: stolen shop light and a way different
effect compared to all of those compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to that ceramic metal halide maybe
someone's running a t5 the whole grow lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of variables for lighting that's going to
give us different shapes different
[SPEAKER_00]: structures different bud density is going
to be something we definitely notice from
[SPEAKER_00]: that then let's talk about air it is
definitely going to be a different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and different humidity
different basic VPD and every grow it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a couple of points off number
matter which girl we go to either the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature will be different the humidity
will be different the diurnal swings will
[SPEAKER_00]: be different it's going to be different in
every girl I promise you all of the girls
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have noticeable differences that is
going to affect plant structure leaf shape
[SPEAKER_00]: and size bud density bud size flavor
terpenes aroma stickiness of the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: final product that's going to have a big
role in your whole room the VPD makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: big difference you got ten different rooms
one guy the guy running that stolen HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: he's probably got a hot room also his buds
are going to get fluffy he's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage more limonene production he's
going to have taller more slender plants
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy with the the plant with the R
switch on his LED his plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be shorter squatty or maybe better node
spacing maybe denser buds there's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be differences throughout just because of
the lighting and the way that the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: are affecting each other I'm saying
there's gonna be a lot of variables let me
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the point here exactly ramble on
this forever we've still got nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about we've got soil to talk about it
could be cocoa it could be hydroponic all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things are going to make a
difference in how the plants perform
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see different growth structures
shapes the leaves can change size and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape not completely drastically but they
can show you a little bit thinner leaf in
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher humidity environment a thicker
leaf in a lower maybe even the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about where the plant came from
and how it is replying or reacting or
[SPEAKER_00]: responding to the environment which you
have now stuck that plant in that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical expression that you're gonna
see so what you could be seeing the short
[SPEAKER_00]: version of what I'm trying to say is this
could just be phenotypical expression
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the room has changed maybe you're
growing it in a different room than you
[SPEAKER_00]: did before maybe it's just changed also
this plant is aging in life if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a clone from a plant and taking a
clone from a plant the plant is continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: to age that plants as old as that original
plant that you started with so there is
[SPEAKER_00]: age in that plant maybe it has changed it
is not genetic drift that is technically
[SPEAKER_00]: not what genetic drift is but there is a
technical word that will not come to my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain right now the plants basically do
change they can change over time
[SPEAKER_00]: everything changes over time that is very
possible that could be happening so my
[SPEAKER_00]: main three options are going to be where
you cut the clone from then it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be phenotypical change then also it's
something with the hormones and changes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant the plant is just evolving it's
getting older those all three could be
[SPEAKER_00]: very possible very likely culprits for
what is happening what you are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing in your garden all right
Brian 420 I think I rambled on long enough
[SPEAKER_00]: about that one I want to thank you for a
great question if you've got any more
[SPEAKER_00]: follow-up questions you know I'd love to
hear from you everybody the email address
[SPEAKER_00]: is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
don't be shy reach out I do love the
[SPEAKER_00]: listener interaction all right this next
message comes from my friend mud and it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes a little bit like this it says Rasta
Jeff I recently purchased some morning dew
[SPEAKER_00]: reg seeds from seeds here now big shout
out to our friends at seedsherenow.com it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I would like to breed a plant to my
chem dog variety to introduce the anti
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew anti bud rot properties to
my chem so if you've been following my
[SPEAKER_00]: brand or my podcast for a while you know
that my line morning dew has been
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered that is very resistant to
powdery mildew and bud rot the past couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of outdoor seasons we've seen a lot of
gardens get decimated by powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: and by bud rot the morning dew we've
gotten a lot of reports that it withstood
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those stresses plants next to it
we're getting mildew plants next to it
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting rot and the morning dew
withstood all of the struggles so our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend mud here wants to get a quality
morning dew male and breed that to his
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog varietal female now it goes on to
say I know it's your indica I know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: your version of an indica I've been
following the podcast for a while now and
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard you speak much about this
is there a reason why no I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: without being prompted I don't really talk
too much about my strains I've done full
[SPEAKER_00]: strain reports I think I've done a full
strain report on the morning dew talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the way it grows the way it smokes
I'm not sure if we knew about the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to powdery mildew at the time a
lot more people have grown it the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has been the seeds have been sold the
plant has been experienced more so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much of that I talked about in
that old episode there's no reason I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the morning dew or that it's
being one of my indicas or anything it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I said I don't really talk about
the strains without being prompted you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to ask a question which you did here
so we will talk about it and I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about the grateful dog in the last episode
so the grateful dog is the the morning dew
[SPEAKER_00]: is the grateful dog pollinated by King
Solomon and most of the phenotypes seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: put off a more indica type quality than
the sativa type qualities they finish more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly than most sativas the buzz is more
indica dominant it grows more with the
[SPEAKER_00]: wider leaf type of a structure some of the
phenotypes do have skinnier leaves but the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant stay short and squat and the buds
get dense more more like what we know as
[SPEAKER_00]: an indica or what I would qualify classify
as an indica it will get you in your head
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit when you smoke it but it's
gonna be more of that I'm gonna say more
[SPEAKER_00]: of an indica varietal then it says I
haven't ever bred before but I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be a good cross my cam has
almost satsuma hazy funk super triked out
[SPEAKER_00]: and the yields are no problem but it does
have a problem with powdery mildew then it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on to say my question is two parts do
you mind if I breed with it it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: personal I'm not selling the beans and
then can you give me a breakdown of what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of phenotypes to expect in advance
you can call me mud as my friends do and
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you in advance all right mud thank
you for the great message thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: the good questions let's answer your
questions about the morning dew and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with it I feel this way about all
of my strains any seeds that you buy from
[SPEAKER_00]: me once you've given me or a vendor or a
trader or anybody money for those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: they are yours you can do whatever you
want with them and I can't drive your car
[SPEAKER_00]: as fast as you want once you bought the
car once you bought the seeds bro they're
[SPEAKER_00]: yours have a good time also be respectful
about that there is kind of a breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: code of ethics there is a code of ethics
you notice when I make a cross I always
[SPEAKER_00]: list the true genetics of what that cross
is I reveal almost everything to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be transparent I feel like you
guys trust me and believe in me because of
[SPEAKER_00]: my transparency so in return whenever you
put out a seed or whatever you do whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you post a picture of it just maybe put in
little parentheses this is Rasta Jeff's
[SPEAKER_00]: morning due to my what was it called
motivation I think you called it or do it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly when you list genetics list of
the ladies first it's always ladies first
[SPEAKER_00]: so girl plant X male plant in the
parentheses there but if you ever talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it list it advertise it promote it
if somebody says what is that just give me
[SPEAKER_00]: a shout out give me a fist bump give me
some credit give me some love that's all I
[SPEAKER_00]: ask for you notice when I talk about a lot
of strains that I work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I bring with I tell you
straight up who they came from who I got
[SPEAKER_00]: the cuts from I didn't invent cannabis I
didn't invent seeds I didn't just fart out
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of seeds and start with those I
had to get plants and seeds from other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders other people that were putting
out quality products things I enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: trusted liked relied on was impressed by
by breeders that I like also if I only
[SPEAKER_00]: work with strains from breeders that I
enjoy also you got to be kind of a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: person if I find out that you're not super
cool maybe I'll eliminate your plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden things like that do matter to me
at this point and I've got the opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to be very selective and picky at this
point also but I ramble on my point is
[SPEAKER_00]: once I've sold you those seeds you could
do whatever you want with them I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that you like my seed line
enough and you trust in what I've said and
[SPEAKER_00]: the reviews and you trust in the product
enough that you've chosen to breed that to
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds to try to make a better product
to fix the problem in there now you see
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm saying by saying that King
Solomon is the fixer you're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning dew to try to be the fixer you
found the recipe to make your pile a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better I am rambling so the
overall answer to part one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: question is yes you do have full
permission to breed with the seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get from me just give me give me some
credit give me some respect anybody out
[SPEAKER_00]: there if you breed with my seeds my plants
my clones whatever just show me love give
[SPEAKER_00]: me your respect maybe send me a 10-pack if
you can not a big deal honestly I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of room to run a lot of stuff
but if it's super intriguing you may see
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of your cross pop up on my social
media pop up in my crosses in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'll send you more shit and return
we can establish friendships and
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships like that I try to get seeds
back to the people who give me clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: things I try to keep the circle going all
right let me keep going because there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: second part to our buddy muds question it
says could you give me a breakdown the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos to expect from the morning dew like
I said I've done the full podcast on the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning dew if you search the grow from
your heart podcast morning do there should
[SPEAKER_00]: be a full episode but we will do a quick
phenos type expectation rundown here since
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna breed with it there are three
main phenotypical categories and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped saying main phenotypes I'm going
to start putting phenotypes into
[SPEAKER_00]: categories because I'm a category kind of
guy and it sets a better expectation
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not looking for this specific plant
I like that you're looking for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes but also I want you to find the
one that's good for you it's like if if I
[SPEAKER_00]: say I like this phenotype you may pass on
the one that would have been stellar for
[SPEAKER_00]: you because you chose the one that's great
for me and you could find a phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: works best for you is my my bottom line my
best advice now the phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: categories which you can expect from the
morning dew there is the og cush leaner
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one that has got cushy rocks to it
that one grows it's got a stretchier
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and it grows a bunch of rocks
that one is gonna be great it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy gassy mothballs real pungent then
there's another which I call the it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: cam leaning phenotype which you can
identify by the acorn style buds it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't grow real long buds it doesn't
grow real chunky rocky buds but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped like a pine cone they're just nice
perfect triangles and they're all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that phenotype tends to turn a
little bit purple a little bit silver a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit darker colors then of course
there is the arise dominant phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the phenotype that gets spears that is
the one that makes the long spears so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got rocks it's going to be more
cushy if you got pine cones that's more
[SPEAKER_00]: chemi if you get the spears that's going
to have a lot of arise in it now it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like in your situation you're going to
need a male plant so I would find a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with a nice structure just look for
the one that is shaped the way you want it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be shaped you're probably going to get
five maybe a 10 pack of seeds maybe more
[SPEAKER_00]: than that but out of the male plants that
you get the first if you've got a 10 pack
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably going to get five males I
would eliminate those first two super
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper vigorous males just get rid of them
my reason for that is they're going to add
[SPEAKER_00]: too much to the mix when we're breeding
most of the time the goal is to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: combine the two plants and see the
representation of both parents in your
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring unless you're trying to lock
down one specific trait I like to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the male and the female can do together if
you've got a male plant that is just too
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant in the mix it'll wash out all of
the traits of the female and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically reproducing that male plant so I
like to find a male that's not a real
[SPEAKER_00]: meathead not just real super aggressive
super vigorous too crazy to flower early
[SPEAKER_00]: grows real crazy tall that's not the dude
that I would use if I had five seeds the
[SPEAKER_00]: third and fourth seeds are probably the
candidates the third and fourth males to
[SPEAKER_00]: show me that they're males to show their
vigor their aggression I guess it is those
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be the two that I start
really eyeballing as my males so find a
[SPEAKER_00]: good male find somebody with good
structure find somebody that flowers at
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate time find a male that puts
out a decent amount of pollen do the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: rub I like a male plant so you're going to
grow at the morning dew look for the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that smells like vomit I know it sounds
crazy male plants when you rub the stem if
[SPEAKER_00]: it smells like acrid puke that is always a
good trait in a male plant in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just my opinion that's from my
experience I love that disgusting acrid
[SPEAKER_00]: vomit puke bar trash can gross smells that
always turns into a good male plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: good puts out good turps in its in its
progeny the offspring will always smell
[SPEAKER_00]: really good if the male plant smells like
vomit so I would work on finding a good
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant you're not going to see the bud
structure that we see from the females
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to be looking for a
boy so find a good shape find a good
[SPEAKER_00]: structure find one with big thick robust
stems that you can work and bend and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't explode when you pop and twist it
because you want the progeny to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: trait as well find one that puts out
pollen in the right amount of time if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can finish this male plant out see how far
they go put a few male plants in a room
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate them let them flower out see which
one you like the best do a phenotype just
[SPEAKER_00]: like you do with the females look at the
bud cluster look at the color do the do
[SPEAKER_00]: the male plants put out any color are the
male flowers turning purple do they put
[SPEAKER_00]: out trichomes do they smell good when they
put out buds then do they get deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: do they handle your feeding well do you
have any bugs do those male plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: beat up by bugs later on in the life of
the plant how bad do those leaves start
[SPEAKER_00]: crinkling up how long does it last that's
gonna tell you a lot about the offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see in that male plant is 50
percent of what you're going to see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring so find a good combo a good
pairing for your plant that you call
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation I think that is it's going to
be so I say this a lot when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding learn about Mendel charts learn
about alleles learn about chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer learn all of that stuff then
forget it all look at two plants and say
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the two plants right there that
need to be bred together use the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: and breeder intuition I think that will
work great for you understand the charts
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the science understand the
biology then understand that you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart breed with love
that's how I have the greatest success I
[SPEAKER_00]: draw the charts I think about the Mendel
charts I really envision it in my head and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I go no you know what that plant and
that plant right there need to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and it's gonna be fucking awesome
most of the time I am correct so develop
[SPEAKER_00]: your intuition check out the plants like I
said grow from your heart the bottom line
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with love you're making this cross
for yourself you're gonna have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to play with there will be a
resistant phenotype within that first mix
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find a couple a bunch hopefully in
there you'll find what you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost no matter which male you select
that trait will pop up it'll be there it
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the mix it's in the gene pool I do
believe you'll find that resistance trait
[SPEAKER_00]: it could pass on I think that is all I've
got for this episode my buddy mud thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the great message I have got
primus songs stuck in my head now also I
[SPEAKER_00]: did say there are three categories of
phenotypes I have another note here there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some weirdos when you're growing the
morning dew you're gonna see some weirdos
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them start off kind of strange be
patient they grow right out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdness a lot of those morning dew
weirdos they snap out of it and they turn
[SPEAKER_00]: into beautiful amazing plants so if you've
got some weird shit happening with your
[SPEAKER_00]: morning dew babies have no fear they will
grow out of it sometimes we just have ugly
[SPEAKER_00]: babies not all babies are beautiful I'm
just kidding you guys they'll grow right
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it though all right that is all
I've got for that episode I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: our for that message and for this episode

[SPEAKER_00]: there I want to thank you once again for
listening to episode 698 of the grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart podcast I say it all the time
it blows my mind when I talk about 698
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes that is amazing to me number 700
is coming up I don't have anything special
[SPEAKER_00]: planned for number 700 high fives and fist
bumps all around however I do have some
[SPEAKER_00]: things planned for episode number 710 I'm
going to do my best to get a very
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known hash maker on the show to
answer some hash questions we'll have some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends from the discord give us some
questions so episode 710 should feature a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful kind of a well-known hash maker
and these parts if you've been hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while you might know who I'm talking
about already don't want to drop any names
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has not been confirmed but once
I confirm I'll tell you all about who's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be on the show here for the 710
episode we're gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates on 710 if you don't know what
710 is about you've got 12 episodes you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna learn something today all right that
is all I've got for this episode I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of here before I keep rambling and
make this a nine-hour show thank you again
[SPEAKER_00]: for listening let's give a big shout out
