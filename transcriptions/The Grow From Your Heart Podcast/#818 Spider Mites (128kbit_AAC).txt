[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to everybody's favorite part
of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of
today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a great question here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention free seeds at the start of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, irydirect.com,
there's a part of the website where it
[SPEAKER_00]: says questions or contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you contact me and send me a grow
question, if I read your question here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast, I will send you a free pack
of iry genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me those grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many people are asking about where
is iry genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The site is under construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will be back very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did update iry direct now that iry
direct is live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on iry genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both sites will be up and running very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, make sure you check out iry
direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send those grow help questions to
the questions tab, the contact tab there
[SPEAKER_00]: on iry direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if I read your question on the
podcast, you will win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The free pack of seeds from today's
episode goes to our friend who wants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: called x-ray toker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend x-ray
toker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the podcast and
thank you for a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few details here about the
garden that are not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to throw that first page over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to jump into the second page
because this is where the question pops
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, please describe your problem and
everything you've done to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, the problem is
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the dreaded spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grower at some point in time is
going to experience spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not experienced spider mites
yet, you are bragging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going, not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming just because you just said
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know you're bragging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be in your grow soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start taking care of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about how to take care
of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But spider mites, everybody's going to get
them once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's either had them or will have
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about ways to prevent them,
but it is a very easy pest to bring home,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very easy pest to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with a little bit of strategy,
a little bit of preparation, a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of watchful eye and eye for detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: These spider mites are not too problematic
to get rid of if we notice them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they start moving around,
infesting all of the plants, getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the rooms, it's more of a pain in
the ass, but it is never impossible to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can get rid of any pest given
enough time, given enough budget and
[SPEAKER_00]: enough manpower and a proper strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can eradicate any pest in any
cultivation facility, how big or small it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about integrated pest
management today, and we're going to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly on spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question says, how do I get rid of
the spider mites without losing all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, some of these strains I've had
for years, bro, as a seed breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: as somebody who relies on my strains,
my genetics, my mother plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely understand how important it
is to not lose those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have sprayed with soapy water
followed by a cold rinsing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have an exhaust fan cranked up with
some serious wind trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do need to clear this out
before my new seed order arrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make me cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be 70 this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, happy birthday, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is almost my only medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being that far into life and
not falling for all of the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions at that age.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do try to push a lot of pills
and a lot of medicines on folks your age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good job for keeping cannabis mostly
your only medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrapped the message up with thanks
and love for the show and great info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you, bro, sincerely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signed it with his real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not say that on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to not break your
heart here, but some of this may be
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it may be a little bit of work,
but together we will get rid of those
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot of stuff written down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you started with soapy water
followed by a cold rinsing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good start, but I bet you those
spider mites just laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites have been evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some spider mites a while back from
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been defeated, but it was a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some new mites from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: These Mendo mites, these super mites,
the mites are evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were like the Ninja turtles of
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took anything I threw at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a year and it took a really solid
winter to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed that Colorado winter to come in
and I blasted that cold air in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room, crippled some plants a little bit,
but that is what got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mites are evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that that soapy cold water,
they just laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh yeah, we needed a bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just cleaned themselves up in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more in depth about getting
rid of these mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I wrote down is when trying
to eradicate a pest, let's focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pest we are facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people just on the internet,
on social media in general, just saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I've got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people will recommend crazy
random shit like spray safer soap or spray
[SPEAKER_00]: oregano oil or spray this or there's many
terrible examples I could give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not focus on the pest you're trying to
eradicate, research that pest and apply
[SPEAKER_00]: the product that will get rid of that
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I told you right now that you're going
to the Olympics tomorrow, would you say
[SPEAKER_00]: what, what event am I in or would you just
prepare for every single event?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I told you you're going to be in the
Olympics tomorrow and you're a figure
[SPEAKER_00]: skater, would you go preparing for the
bobsled team or would you prepare for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few months to be a figure skater?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is prepare for the thing
that we need to attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're facing spider mites,
let's attack spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got thrips, let's attack thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got fungus gnats, let's go right
for the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not just use random, generic hippie
ideas that might work for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus in and attack the insects
we're trying to attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, just a moment ago,
let's attack the pest we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter which insect, pest, predator,
whatever it is we're trying to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: in our garden, it has a life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to live a certain amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's, if it's a bigger pest,
something like a rabbit or a deer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a pest that gets in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk as much about
that, but those could live four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an insect, his whole life cycle
could be a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got to learn also not only the
life cycle of our pest, but we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the breeding cycle of those
pests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the bugs we're battling are born
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they came out pregnant already.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of hood bugs do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understand the life cycle of the pest
you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the breeding cycle of the pest
you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's disrupt both of those processes
within these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a better chance of beating
these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a little research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand how do they live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they live under the foliage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they live on the stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they live in the dirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do these bugs live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand where they live, how they live
and how they breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're getting into their heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a much better opportunity to
eradicate these intruders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we've identified the insect,
which we are choosing to do battle with
[SPEAKER_00]: today's victim is going to be spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to come into our room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show them we don't play
that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get rid of these spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've identified the pest,
then you need to make some personal
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want to attack these spider
mites or whichever bug you may be facing?
[SPEAKER_00]: One good option is predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to start with predator mites
or predator insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: And your grow and use those as a way to
eradicate your current bug situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very useful, very cost effective
way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to release bugs into your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can take a little bit of time for
those bugs to establish a colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and find where they need to
go to go find the bug that they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a battle that needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually your predators will
out eat all of the other bugs and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they will die off as well or they'll move
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a perpetual environment,
maybe those bugs will stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you run out of bugs, they may
disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predator bugs is a very effective way
of eradicating bugs in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does take a little bit of time for
them to get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about sprayed pesticide applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always a very reliable way to get
rid of almost any pest is a sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where you have to make more
ethical decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What types of sprays do you want to apply
to your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to say I use all
organic products, but then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: remind you that cyanide is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get any of that in your body,
you're going to get sick and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't focus too much on the word
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be sold by the word organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus more on the active ingredients
and inactive ingredients in that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research on what is in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about how gentle or non gentle
you want to be, how aggressive you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go, how much chemical blast you want to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to say it's a scale
of organic to nuclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic, like we just said, is kind of a
buzzword.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you want to go gentle hippie soap?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to go fucking amid a clope
rid?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far in between do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to happen to the product
that you are going to grow and sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to consume it yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you making concentrates out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making concentrates,
you're concentrating the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's still in that plant, are you going
to make edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you going to eat those
pesticides yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to sell that product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you selling it to the street or are
you selling it to medical, medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things to think about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to smoke it yourself,
do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you feel comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody else is going to get this
product, be very careful and very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very thoughtful about what you spray or
apply to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be nutrients, pesticides,
anything in this realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're putting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's for you, that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's going to someone else,
it's your responsibility to pass a safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, ethical product along to your
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving you trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expecting cannabis that is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be consumed, make sure you give them
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you're going to spray on
there, make sure that it is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is consumable that you would consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the half-life and the duration
of life that these chemicals will last in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spraying something systemic,
it could stick around in that plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start understanding how long it takes for
that pesticide to break down within that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, it's gone by the time you
harvest, but pay attention to those sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are a lot of things to
understand when it comes to applying
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides that people completely
overlook, but understand what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, let's think a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few more things I want to
touch on before we go too deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to a clean grow room and the key
to not getting spider mites or the key to
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of spider mites is really
don't get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for this person, it's too late,
but maybe some of you are saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, we start at day
one with preventing spider mites or any
[SPEAKER_00]: other pests from entering the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your responsibility as the farmer to
make sure no pests get in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, it's your job to react quickly
and understand how to mitigate the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: before it becomes a tragedy in that grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to blame soil bags
for bringing in bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought the bag into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have understood what was coming
along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that sort of stuff in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we prevent bugs from entering the
grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic cleanliness is one of the main
ingredients to a successful grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a leaf on the floor,
get that leaf out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leaf went into a trash bag or a trash
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that trash can and or trash bag dumped
and out of the grow facility to a dumpster
[SPEAKER_00]: outside as far away as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bunch of debris,
just random shit in the grow space that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't need to be there, if it's your
grow tools, your t-shirt, your drink,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever doesn't need to be in there,
get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more places for bugs to hide,
things for them to hide under,
[SPEAKER_00]: places for them to hide on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a basic standard operating
procedure for your cultivation facility
[SPEAKER_00]: for a sanitary grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that means to you, how are you
going to, I don't know where your grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in your basement,
your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in a big commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in a barn in a field,
whatever you need to do to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedure to create a
sanitary growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you need to figure out as the
ganja farmer on duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need to build a clean room where
you walk in and change your shoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: your clothes, spray your hair down with
something, wrap your hair up, put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hat, however you want to do it,
put on some gloves, then go into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a step that you need to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're coming from one grow to the
other, definitely have a space where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can stop and change a lab coat or do
something to just make another layer so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you're in here in this grow
space, all the spider mites are sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: onto that lab coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in another room with a different lab
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help mitigate spreading the
problem, but create an SOP so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't bring bugs in and you do not move
bugs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the trash gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trash doesn't need to just go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your grow is in your basement,
don't just bring the trash up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen or the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to get to the curb as quickly as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go into the grow, I tie up my
dreadlocks and put a hat over them so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if anything does try to climb on me,
hopefully it stays on the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask, yes, I do wash the
dreadlocks, but they could get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could move some bugs around in the
dreadlocks, so that's why we got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about your equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a separate set?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about shoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people wear the same shoes
outside and then you go into a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you walk through outside,
were there spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there powdery mildew perhaps on a
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a fungus now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a thrip?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you bring in from outside on your
shoes into your grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your grow space is a beautiful
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you got in there, that spider
mite, that thrip, that fungus now,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was, I went, oh, this is
fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went and found a hotel in one of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So change your clothes, change your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about your gear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have, and we should be doing this
anyway because hoplite and viroid is
[SPEAKER_00]: running rampant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you changing scissors between
different grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using gear for outside that you're
using inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cross contaminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's kind of segue into things that
we can actually do within the grow to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to help mitigate pest problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I really think is beneficial is
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate all the leaves with the big
purple petiole or the gigantic leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are blocking the sun from getting to the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull those leaves off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need those leaves anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are where the bugs are going
to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get powdery mildew on top of
the leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: No leaves, no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make as few leaves as possible in that
room, but keep the plants healthy and you
[SPEAKER_00]: will mitigate pest problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I like and this
listener mentioned is wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get some fans going in that
room, spider mites and bugs do not like
[SPEAKER_00]: wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like a nice calm place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can eat some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get some ass and they can make
some webs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disrupt that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it uncomfortable for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another thing I talked about a moment
ago is don't cross contaminate your grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got home grows in multiple
rooms, don't go from room A to room B
[SPEAKER_00]: without taking care of yourself,
especially if you see a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up, change your lab coat,
change your shoes, change whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got grows in two different
houses, perhaps change clothes from house
[SPEAKER_00]: to house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working in multiple cultivation
facilities as a consultant, definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: change your shoes and your clothes between
facilities if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of facilities now have a foot wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You step into this little tray and it puts
shit all over your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleaner stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sneaker head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll spray this splash this shit onto
your shoes and then you step onto another
[SPEAKER_00]: tray and it puts a little booty right over
your shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're walking around with fresh clean
feet in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really great for a commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any bushes or flowers or shrubs
or plants outside of your house or your
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility that are housing
insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon to see somebody just go
to Lowe's and get some spray product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, use some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Lowe's also go to your local home
hardware store, local hardware store if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have one, but go get some pesticide
spray and spray that on the plants outside
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can get rid of the bugs out
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do that, they're going to try
to move in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But treat the outdoor once or twice a year
so there's no bugs in the shrubs and
[SPEAKER_00]: bushes outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can remove those, go get rid of
those shrubs and bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand nature is happening out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't chop down all the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I really want to make sure
to mention is I do see a lot of yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky traps in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to think about is those are not
to eradicate bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are to indicate the presence of a
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have those all over the grow
every six or 12 feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a yellow sticky card so
that when you walk by it, you can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should look at it as you walk by in
the morning, walk by as you look at lunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: walk by at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a peek.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one bug on there at one point
in time, make a mental note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's three bugs on there later,
make a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three bugs, shit's increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one or two bugs, that's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly around, they see light,
shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start getting increasing
numbers of bugs, that's a sign shit is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to start taking care of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang yellow sticky traps or even the
blue sticky traps in the grow to indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of some pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to release predator bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many options for predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, choose your bug
wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're getting the predators
that you think you will have pest so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can fight what is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to apply sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to apply sprays,
I recommend sprays on a rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have multiple products on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them on a rotation on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my grow environments, I try to spray on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see any sort of a problem,
I step it up and I spray on Monday and
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the change of seasons, I spray on
Monday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I anticipate bugs trying to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got an extra spray this week on
Thursday just to make sure nothing sneaks
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you are spraying products,
one thing I highly recommend is research
[SPEAKER_00]: every product which you are going to
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the product you are going to
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the inactive ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what those active ingredients
can do to you if you are exposed to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray that and get some on your
skin, what is going to happen to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand those sorts of risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up the label on those bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pesticide bottle has a label and it
unfolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little booklet in there that
will tell you a lot about that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read that, see if it says
warning, danger, hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it's got a skull and crossbones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the level of danger, level of
hazard which that pesticide presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then read about the personal protective
equipment required to apply that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are going to tell you wear
long sleeves, wear gloves, cover up your
[SPEAKER_00]: feet for sure when you're applying a
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go doing it barefoot like a hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend a respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spraying with a paint spray or
anything that makes bubbles, wear a
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator because you don't want to
breathe in those microbubbles with
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, eye protection is a must and if you
got long hair, dreadlocks, or even not,
[SPEAKER_00]: cover up your head and be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you research the personal
protective equipment needed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide you are applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since I am certified by the Colorado
Department of Agriculture as a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator and handler, I am also train
the trainer certified by the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: State University and the Colorado
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trained by Theo Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it some credentials here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with all that being said, I should
remind you about something that is called
[SPEAKER_00]: the re-entry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever we apply a pesticide,
we should apply that pesticide with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights off and then safely exit that room
and then we should hang a sign on the
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with anybody else,
there's a sign that is required on the
[SPEAKER_00]: door that says, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We sprayed a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sprayed this at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to enter for this many
hours from that time so that nobody goes
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room and gets wet pesticide
product on their skin, breathes in that
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what is called a re-entry
interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in the room until that re-entry
interval is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people may not know this,
but if we are applying a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, you should double the recommended
re-entry interval printed on that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those products are not designed to
be sprayed and applied indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are for outdoor commercial
use or outdoor agricultural use.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we apply these products indoors,
we are not getting sunshine on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting wind like we would
normally get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the natural environment to
break down that pesticide and dry it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and make the plant process it or break
down the way that it should on naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is highly recommended to double the
re-entry interval when applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide spray application indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that because I am
certified by the Department of Ag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would feel very irresponsible to
not give you that disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For preventative measures, I recommend
spraying once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, if you see any
problems popping up, double that spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray Monday and spray Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the problem gets bad, consider spraying
three times a week, but that will get
[SPEAKER_00]: brutal on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see them respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may tell you, hey, that is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to settle it down,
especially depending on the products you
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have said before that you can apply what
I call a tank mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is multiple pesticides mixed together
at one time in one tank and spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that if you research each
pesticide which you are applying and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: be redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to apply one that is a
pyrethrum based, don't put two pyrethrum
[SPEAKER_00]: based products in there together,
but don't get redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put one pyrethrum
product in there, don't mix in just
[SPEAKER_00]: another pyrethrum product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put something else, a different mode of
attack inside of that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can hit the bugs with two
different attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw a left and when they try to
block the left, you can throw that right
[SPEAKER_00]: and knock them right the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two products, maybe three products at a
time is not a bad idea if you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what and why you are mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe mix a little batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't mix a whole bunch at one time
so you don't get a chemical reaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a tank mix is highly acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is my preventative strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray once a week with a rotated
pesticide schedule on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Monday I spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see a problem, I step it up to every
Thursday on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pesticide rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few products I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they work really well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a kind of an idea,
I like to use, we'll say Botanigard Maxx
[SPEAKER_00]: on Monday and then Evergreen on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would probably do something
like, and also make sure you're checking
[SPEAKER_00]: with your local state guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using this in a commercial
facility, I don't know what is regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making recommendations for what I do
in a personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a commercial grow,
things are regulated by the MED and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Ag, so make sure you pay
attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would do like the Botanigard Maxx
and then Evergreen and then probably like
[SPEAKER_00]: Venerate on the next one and then just
start the rotation over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have a pest problem, I see a
couple things I would possibly do like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Evergreen and Venerate together and then
do Botanigard Maxx and maybe the Evergreen
[SPEAKER_00]: again the next time, just to double up and
throw some super punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be afraid to do a tank mix and
get creative and knock those bad
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfuckers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I do have notes and I feel like I
fell off my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Attack!
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the attack phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say that we do see some bugs in
our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to step it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just Monday, we're spraying
Monday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This all depends on where you are in the
grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in veg, go ahead and spray the
shit out of them with whatever you want
[SPEAKER_00]: that is up to your ethical standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flower, you really need to
consider what you are spraying on these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the first 21 days of flower,
you've got a lot more opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 10 to 14 days, go ahead and
spray away unless you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to mess up those pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all about the phase and how far
into flower you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some products we could spray
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to spray too late if
we don't have to, but sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going into flower and you do
spot a bunch of bugs and you want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of them, that is the time to overload
the garden with those living predator
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are still in the veg phase,
go ahead and spray whatever you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start hitting them on Monday with one or
two products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit them again on Thursday with one or two
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that going until you see there are no
pests present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even continue one or two
applications even after you think the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to me to spray every room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a mom room, a veg room,
a clone area, a flower area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all commercial buildings with a
lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that everything is treated
equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those mother plants are where it all
starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those veg plants are the building blocks
for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flower room is the bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all equally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that those bugs are all getting
treated in every room or you're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to move them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get those mother plants super
clean and get the veg plants super clean
[SPEAKER_00]: and then keep them clean through flower,
that is the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe release a whole fuck ton of
predator bugs in your mom room and then
[SPEAKER_00]: those bugs will keep moving around with
you once you establish colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those bugs coming in the mom room
every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add more, add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you cut clones, keep that schedule
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe order more bugs every week you cut
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut some clones, add more bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut some clones, add more bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it all moves down the chain from the
mom room to the veg room to the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the bugs alive in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a good strategy that may work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple modes of attack on an aggressive
routine twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, a moment ago,
be specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring a knife to a might fight,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring a knife to a might fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're fighting spider mites,
don't bring something designed to fight
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're fighting thrips, don't bring
some shit to design to fight spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easier than it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was hard to say, but you know
what I'm trying to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're fighting spider mites,
get a pesticide designed at eradicating
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go get some hippie soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try some witchcraft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do voodoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get a pesticide that says designed to
eradicate spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go at it hard right at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's win the battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keeping in mind the fact that we are
understanding which pest we are battling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are those bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they on the underside of the leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they living in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do those pests reside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they hanging out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's treat that appropriate area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spray the bottoms of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the undersides of the leaves and
work your way up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also possibly maybe a suggestion,
if these bugs go into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you got thrips or fungus gnats,
we need to treat the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do what is called a soil
dredge.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite soil dredges is
evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix up my water just like a bunch of
five gallon buckets, just like I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will put an amount of evergreen
in those buckets and stir it really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will water that into the plants
until it runs off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure that I've got evergreen in
all of that soil, all of that medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using cocoa, soil, whatever
you're working with, saturate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat again in about three or four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've probably gotten rid of all
of your soil borne pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bugs that were in the dirt are
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to fly up and try to get to
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sprayed those leaves with
something, maybe a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to want to be up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a non-desirable environment for
those bugs, whether it's a poison or just
[SPEAKER_00]: something uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put something on the leaves and they won't
want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about what bug you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to treat the leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to treat the dirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to treat both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also clean up the room and ourselves
and go full heavy attack mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, do you want to go bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go organic or do you want
to go nuclear?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many suggestions for getting rid
of spider mites on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to work, but you just
have to decide how ethical that product is
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to consume that or pass
that to your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes an infestation can just get
way too far ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we don't notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you go away on vacation,
you come back, shit happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you've got a helper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what they were looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes shit does get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to let that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you slipped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you fucked up and you got spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're real bad and you're thinking
I cannot beat these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the last ditch effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've tried every pesticide you can
think of, if you released all the bugs you
[SPEAKER_00]: can think of, here is one more idea that
we can do to get rid of these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last ditch effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get a reservoir of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a pesticide in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a million fucking options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use, you can use anything from
hydrogen peroxide to smite to banish to
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreen to triac 70 to venerate to a
much more powerful products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to mention here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a real problem, I'll help
you, but I don't want to share these
[SPEAKER_00]: product names with anybody who doesn't
really have a struggle problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be using these unless it's a
last ditch effort to save some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, mix up a reservoir, a dunk dish of
a pesticide solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to cut some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go to your plant that's got
spider mites on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut a clone off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to dunk it in that dunk
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dunk it in there and swish the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the spider mites off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the webbing off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever product you need to use,
get that shit off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will tell you depending on the
pesticide that you just used, if you use
[SPEAKER_00]: smite or banish, you do need to dunk them
and rinse them and clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean water and get that pesticide off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticide is now within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is moving within the cells of the plant
if you use some things, and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to keep the bugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But give them a good dunk and make sure to
at least get all these spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: the webs, the bugs off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then dunk it into the wet, the clean dish
to get rid of the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pop that clone as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dip it in your clone solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop it into the clone dome or the easy
cloner, however you normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now pay very close attention to those
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they are rooted and able to get
put into pots, we need to start treating
[SPEAKER_00]: them right away with an integrated pest
management routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get the Evergreen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evergreen is not too too brutal on small
plants and give it a light application of
[SPEAKER_00]: Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably do that Monday and
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then next week I'd probably switch to the
Venerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then next week I'd go Botanic Garden Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just make sure that we got rid of
the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be easier to treat the bugs
on these little tiny plants than it would
[SPEAKER_00]: on these big gigantic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dunk them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to rinse them, clip them,
dip them, and stick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you do your clones, that's a whole
other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change to that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now watch that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put a trash bag over those
big mommy plants and we're going to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: those down and get the fuck rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going in the trash or the burn
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to go ASAP far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's get rid of the dirt that they
were in also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even throw away the whole fucking
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on how bad and how mad you are at
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just out in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just out by the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But far, far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it to the dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to get rid of these clothes
that you're wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to clean the clothes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to clean your dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get rid of the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have come home with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go straight to the shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your clothes in the washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some clean clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's start treating those plants
like they're lightly infested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep the infested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we got rid of the most of the
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they could still be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big plants are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The babies are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much easier to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can preserve our genetics
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let me make sure I've gotten all
of the notes because I was going quite
[SPEAKER_00]: fast because there's a lot that I wanted
to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I did a pretty decent job.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good job here of talking about how to
eradicate pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing here is don't
bring a knife to a gunfight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're fighting spider mites,
attack spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're attacking thrips, attack thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just buy whatever pesticide was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shelf that is not setting yourself up
for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how we win.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how we do it in the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the right shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's win this battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,

clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
