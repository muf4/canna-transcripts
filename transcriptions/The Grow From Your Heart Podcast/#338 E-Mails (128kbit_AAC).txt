[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode
338 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, this episode of the
show is brought to you by my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hella Dank seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, make sure you check out
[SPEAKER_00]: dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start this episode
off by letting you know what I am dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just came back from the dispensary with
some fresh dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up some blue cheese, full
spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is UK cheese and blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The description on the container is
berries and cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of cheese, a little bit of
berries and then a little bit of dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: feet at the end, which I really appreciate
in my concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also picked up more of this orange
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nectar, it's orange OG and orange juice
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package describes the aroma and flavor
as ammonia, tangerines, diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the orange, I get the diesel,
but the hibiscus, I'm not sure if I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize that if it punched me in the
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I got the blue cheese and I've
got the orange earth nectar, both from
[SPEAKER_00]: green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also picked up a grab of the doctor who
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's described as passion fruit,
guava and strawberry taffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't busted this gram open yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always a satisfying concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also picked up a little bit of the guava
papaya nectar described as sour and fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: and soft fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what soft fruits they're
speaking of, but it did have the fuely
[SPEAKER_00]: funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did have the sourness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it had the aftertaste of maybe a
green gummy worm or something in that
[SPEAKER_00]: green candy sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great concentrates from our friends at
green dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been killing it lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'll be smoking on on this
beautiful, rainy, cool weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so hot in Colorado, you guys,
and it's been raining for a couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 100 degrees every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 77 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so nice to go for a drive,
get a little bit of rain on the
[SPEAKER_00]: windshield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a nice relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys don't want to hear
about the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about podcasting, a little bit
of an equipment update.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I had some equipment
failure in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard it in the past couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone says quit apologizing,
but I'm honestly sincerely, I'm sorry that
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to record an episode where I'm
going to read listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if something craps out,
we're not losing too much technical
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I put together a really
intensive episode and had a tech failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a couple of email episodes
until I get things solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I'm confident in the equipment
again, we will get back to those intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise they're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have already got some of them
written out, so I want to put them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to frustrate myself by
putting them out half ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear with me while I work through some
email episodes, a couple of random topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a couple of fun episodes here,
and then we're going to get back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back into those really
educational and intensive episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that everything
works and I can get it to you guys in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff expected style.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough rambling about
equipment and updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've been talking about the
lemon Jeffrey and the golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds that are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have been chopped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take several days for those plants
to become dry enough for me to even think
[SPEAKER_00]: about making them smaller so that I can
start pulling the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to let the plants dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to get cut down into smaller
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds have to get chopped into tiny,
tiny pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I sift through and get every single
seed out and remove it from the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they've got to get packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a little while before they are
available, but they have been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few seeds in this batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked earlier that it took me a few
extra sprays to get that golden goat to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just did not want to go for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to hit it a couple extra times more
than I usually would.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finally reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got pollen out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make as many seeds as we would
have hoped for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will make more again in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a regular seed run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will consider more feminized lemon
Jeff and golden goat seeds based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sales of this current batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be ready in just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be very limited in this batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move into some news
before we get to some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following the podcast,
you know that I've been updating you on a
[SPEAKER_00]: chain of dispensaries in Colorado known as
Sweetleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a quick update and then
we'll get into the current situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf had several dispensaries in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were charged with what was known as
looping.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, a customer is allowed to buy
one ounce per person per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf was breaking the rule and
letting people come back multiple times a
[SPEAKER_00]: day to buy more than one ounce,
which was deemed to be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary was raided and shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their licenses in Denver were taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a few stores with remaining
licenses until we read this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from The Westward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written by Thomas Mitchell and it
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Sweetleaf's three
remaining metro dispensaries suspended by
[SPEAKER_00]: the MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf isn't out of the law enforcement
and regulatory crosshairs just because its
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver stores are no longer open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its licenses for the three remaining
Sweetleaf dispensaries in the metro area
[SPEAKER_00]: were all suspended by the state marijuana
enforcement division as of today,
[SPEAKER_00]: July 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm recording on the 27th.
[SPEAKER_00]: MED signs on the doors of Sweetleaf
dispensaries in Aurora, Federal Heights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Thornton all say the store's licenses
are suspended for alleged violation of
[SPEAKER_00]: state medical or retail marijuana codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the MED communications director
Shannon Gray confirmed the closures,
[SPEAKER_00]: she declined to go into further detail
other than nothing that Sweetleaf is part
[SPEAKER_00]: of an ongoing investigation and that any
further MED disciplinary action will
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on the results of the
investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did note that the local law
enforcement agencies helped the MED serve
[SPEAKER_00]: the suspensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there's more to this article,
but it just basically updates us from what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sweetleaf had a few more dispensaries
and now they have been shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf is really struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I will keep you updated with
what goes on with the Sweetleaf closures
[SPEAKER_00]: as things progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's shift gears a little
bit and work on some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys wanna send me an email to read
on the show, my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the interaction,
I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not responded to emails on the show
in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on those grow lessons,
as you have heard, but I've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for some emails, so let's get
right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several days ago, I was on a podcast
called the Growing with Fish's Podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: they asked me a question about what was
coming up for my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I had planned for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: My response to that question was that I
wanted to learn how to interview breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: better and have more people on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't mean that I wanted to abandon
the format and totally change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just meant that it would be nice to be
able to call up my buddy Subcool and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to Subcool and get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool to go up to Denver and see
Colin from the Ethos Collective and get
[SPEAKER_00]: him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool to get Mr. Soul because
they all live just right in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not too far away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great to have them on the
show, but I need to practice on people who
[SPEAKER_00]: don't intimidate me, who I don't have so
much respect for, I guess, and get better
[SPEAKER_00]: at actually interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I said is that I
wanted to become a better interviewer and
[SPEAKER_00]: interview folks on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That inspired this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from somebody who I've interacted
with several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they want their name set
on the show, so I will just read their
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, And I just want to tell you,
you're doing a great job, and I enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: the show Growing with Fishes this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not change your concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enjoy learning from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interview show every now and then is
okay, but keep doing the good work that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned so much from you,
and my product is so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My patients love my product now that I
have been learning by who it feels is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the greatest teachers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have listened to other podcasts and
other shows, and none of them compare to
[SPEAKER_00]: yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also asked for some suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I just wanted to know if you have
any suggestions with one of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sends me a picture of a
scarlet begonias plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I grew it from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about four feet tall now,
but it has stopped growing and just
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of your help and keep up
the good work in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great things to touch
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, he says, I'm doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was struggling for a couple of episodes
with the show, but I feel like we are back
[SPEAKER_00]: on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the Growing
With Fishes show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is available on YouTube for everybody
else to listen to if you didn't catch it
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, do not change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change your concept because you
enjoy learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not plan to change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add a couple of more things
to what I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be more versatile in my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how many people would listen if we
had Subcool on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how many more people it would
expose the show to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like that are advantageous for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interview every now and then would be
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do plan on keeping up the grow
lessons and the grow episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, you said you're learning by who
it feels is one of the greatest teachers
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot that people are learning
from me, that your garden is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: better, that your patients are enjoying
your garden better, and that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably just enjoying growing more
because of the little bit of time that I
[SPEAKER_00]: put into this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email and thank
you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say you listen to other podcasts
and none of them compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's get into this plant that you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I grew that from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this plant is a monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely Sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got it behind a brick fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to grow way over that block
wall before the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I grew it from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about four feet tall, but it has
stopped growing and just flowering out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of your help and keep up
the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flowering out because it has reached
its critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is getting a long enough night cycle
now to where that plant knows that fall
[SPEAKER_00]: and winter are coming and it needs to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is doing exactly what it is supposed to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a photo period plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that when the fall starts
coming, when the light cycle starts
[SPEAKER_00]: getting shorter, we have longer nights and
shorter days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant goes, oh, it is time for me to
start putting out my buds because it wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are only supposed to live for one
year, so now it's going to put out its
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal of this plant is to get
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to put out buds with big,
sticky pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its goal is to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get pollinated, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, no one in your neighborhood has
got a male outdoors, so it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will just keep stacking up calyxes,
which are basically where the seeds would
[SPEAKER_00]: go because it wants seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to create seed so that at the end
of the season, it can dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would still be standing there on the
stalk at the end of the season if it
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't disturbed by any people or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this were nature, it would dry out on
that stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds would fall into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would freeze over over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all that moisture would thaw out in
the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would germinate those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that warmth and that water would tell
those seeds, hey, it's time to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would start sprouting up,
and then you'd repeat that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would veg out through the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would get nice and tall,
like your plant here is in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about this time of year, it would
start flowering out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is doing exactly what it should
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your plant looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be taller than that block
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already warning you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to hide it behind those
other plants that are there and that block
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, you're going to have to start doing
some tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to tie that thing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get some string or some fishing line
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something softer than that to attach
it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like a couple of twisty ties,
a bread tie, a fuzzy stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a couple of things to attach it to the
plant so it's not all pressure on one spot
[SPEAKER_00]: and not too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tie it to the plant, and then just
bend it over like a fishing pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bend that bitch over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bend it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to feel when you're pulling
too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bend it over until it's kind of
arched over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll start growing straight up
again, but bend it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you have to keep bending it,
keep doing it because that plant is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get tall out there in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got quite a ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to come down until probably
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a long ways to grow that plant
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your question sounded like you were
worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that plant is doing exactly what
it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't change the format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please keep the good pictures and
emails coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this next email I thought was
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd read this one on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, please don't use my
name on the air if you read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be cool for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, long time listener and
cannabis enthusiast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the show and I look forward to the
new episodes Mondays and Thursdays of
[SPEAKER_00]: every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was looking into some clones in
Colorado and I was wondering if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: any recommendations as far as nurseries
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who loves granddaddy
purple to help with his insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a nursery that carries these would be
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for always putting out fantastic
information and helping to educate people
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thank you for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks forward to the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me that people are
just looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means I'm not just rambling to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one kind of put a weird visual in
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, I envision somebody
walking into like the Home Depot nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: area or like whatever Jeff's Grow
Emporium, if you want to go to the mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: pop type style shop and they walk in and
the guy's like, Oh, how you doing ma'am?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Indica's are over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sativa's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our hybrids placed over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for the head stash,
we've got that over here and our elite
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts are kept back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody walks into this little fancy
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, dude, I fucking wish it was like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding clones in Colorado is not going to
be as easy as you think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no nurseries like you speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to dispensaries and those
dispensaries may have a tray or two of
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking clones that may be labeled
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds very cynical and
that doesn't sound very positive and it
[SPEAKER_00]: may sound kind of discouraging,
but to tell you the truth, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased clones from dispensaries several
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably close to accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to say six out of 10 times
those plants were not labeled accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, I went to a dispensary
that no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they used to carry a strain that was
really hyped at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was when medical marijuana was just
getting super popular and all these hype
[SPEAKER_00]: strains were really coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain was featured in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in several of their magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dispensary only offered small batches
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a batch that was supposed to drop
on my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary was two hours from my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, I called them the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I would like to buy the limit
of this strain that you sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to buy the limit of
clones that I can purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, sure, we'll do that for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed up at this dispensary when
they're supposed to open, uh, it started
[SPEAKER_00]: snowing that morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so not a big deal, but I had to drive
to Denver in the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized it is daylight savings time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first day that the time moved
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dispensary opened an hour late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat in front of the dispensary in line
with other people for an hour because they
[SPEAKER_00]: announced that they were getting this drop
of this strain that would go on sale that
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just happened to be my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro, save me the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limit per customer was a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had a quarter of that saved for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't mention the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't mention the dispensary because
we'll, that doesn't need to be said right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but they had a quarter they're
supposed to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the limit that I could get was six
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get in there and I was like,
man, I'm a, this guy called last night and
[SPEAKER_00]: he goes, oh yeah, the notes right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one that talked to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I sold all that strain last
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said the name of the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro, I drove up here from
Pueblo to get that bag for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my birthday, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up here just to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're supposed to have six clones for
me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, oh, he didn't bring the
clones yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, so what am I up here for,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I'll tell you what,
dude, I'll go to the car and I will get
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the rules are way different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to the car and got his head stash
of this strain and brought it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: store and weighed me out seven grams for
myself and sold it to me out of his bag
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't want to fuck over the
store's reputation because I shopped there
[SPEAKER_00]: quite frequently for it being so far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he called his buddy to bring me the
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were all in rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were barely rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of looked like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he told me if I bought all six of
them, that he would only charge me for
[SPEAKER_00]: three since it was my birthday and that
I'd kind of had a shitty experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made me sit in front of the
dispensary for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got six clones for the price of three
and I bought the bag of the hype strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'd been looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought the plants home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I potted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flowered them out and you guys,
there were three different fucking plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in that batch of clones and none of them
were the strain that I paid for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dispensary was in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to another dispensary in Colorado
Springs and I purchased what was supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be lemon OG and blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling this amazing lemon OG
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I would buy it, it would be
bright green buds with these bright orange
[SPEAKER_00]: highlights in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just frosty and it smelled like
lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I can grow the shit out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how I grew it, it wouldn't come
out like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not the same clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They falsely advertised that that clone
was that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wanted to sell more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably had some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They realized this sucks and they just
wanted a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It out and get rid of it and make a few
bucks off of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just cut it, stuck it in rapid
routers, barely got it rooted and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sold it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry they sold me was actually
tremendous and I really loved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that lemon thing they sold me was not
what was advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two prime examples of being
duped and sold clones that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled properly and not what I expected
and not what I paid for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you can't just go looking for a
specific strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a dispensary that just cuts a
bunch of a certain strain to put out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf to have them for customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of that's counterintuitive for a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you growing because they
want you shopping and buying from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going to give you their
head stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few dispensaries at which you
can purchase clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they will have ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what they'll have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't order them from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make requests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow will cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will manifest it in a transfer to the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The store will receive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put it on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully someone at the store will have
some knowledge on how to take care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where to send you because if
I recommend a facility or a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: you go there and you buy a clone and they
give you some shit that's got mites on it
[SPEAKER_00]: or turns out to not be what it was
labeled, then I feel like it's partly on
[SPEAKER_00]: me because I recommended the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did buy a Durban Poison clone
from Kind Love several years ago and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was absolutely Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely bug free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I got a Platinum OG clone from the
clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely Platinum OG and it was
absolutely bug free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, not to bust your bubble,
dude, it sounds like you're expecting
[SPEAKER_00]: something that doesn't really exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a place in Denver that advertises
that they have a ton of clones available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove there one time with a lot of money
in my pocket and a couple of friends in
[SPEAKER_00]: the car because we're limited on how many
plants we can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all knew the drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all going to buy our limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all going to one garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This place had nothing but fucking spider
mites, powdery mildew and embarrassing
[SPEAKER_00]: clones available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even want to say the name of
their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to send you there to go fuck
up your garden because that's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: what you'll be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this same email, you mentioned that
your friend loves Granddaddy Purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: you would love a Granddaddy Purple clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GDP is readily available in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would recommend is that you
order some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check with dankseed.store and see
if they've got the Granddaddy Purple seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: available and get yourself a pack,
maybe two packs of those and grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow out whatever your legal limit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're allowed six plants, grow six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them, cure them, then take samples to
your friend, label it GDP1, GDP2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you know what he's smoking so that
you know which each plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess grow it, keep a clone of it,
then flower it out, then let him smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his favorite, he'll have two
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be two that you got to narrow it
down from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those two and grow them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then give him a blind test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this one or does this one work for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see which one works best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the best Granddaddy
Purple phenotype from seed that is perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: for your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a good caregiver does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some of the difference between just
being a cashcropper and a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and being somebody that is growing
to help somebody heal and improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and enjoy their life a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend getting some seeds,
bro, and growing out some Granddaddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not hard to find, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be easier to find than a clean
Granddaddy Purple cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, thanks for reaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great email and dude,
good job trying to take care of your
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope he is able to find some relief from
his insomnia as he's smoking for insomnia
[SPEAKER_00]: is why he likes the GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, let's move on to the next
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next email comes from, let's see,
they don't want their name said,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're just going to get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hello Rasta Jeff, longtime
listener of the wonderful podcast writing
[SPEAKER_00]: from Prohibition Land in Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for all the great
knowledge that you have given me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bring more Grow Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get this equipment fixed and
we'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he describes his setup quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, The one thing I'm thinking
may be the issue is when I adjust the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tap water seems like it takes a lot,
maybe six to nine mils of pH adjusting
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to get from 7.2 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it could be my starting water
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am letting it sit a few hours before
using it if that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: My humidity stays between 50 and 65%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timps are between 78 and 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plants are not affected,
only a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: All leaves aren't affected, only a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the plants which are affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've attached some picks, which I have
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says what the strain is supposed
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I says he's growing in a 10 by 10 room,
600 Watts of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's describing the setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I overlooking something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I not worry about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he asked, could this be chlorine,
chloramine or other other toxicity from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tap water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can come up with could be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've attached picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, then he says, you can say my name from
Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Adam, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, from looking at your pictures and
from what you've said, there are a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that get my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I would calibrate my pH meter
if I were you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that pH meter could be off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got a Blue Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got a Milwaukee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the first thing I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't calibrate it yourself,
maybe if you take it to the grow shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my local grow shop, they'd be happy
to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just take the pen to the grow
store and be like, Hey, can you guys show
[SPEAKER_00]: me how to calibrate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe they can check it for you and
they can say, Oh dude, you've been so far
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's taken so much to
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't know how much water
you're adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you said, uh, take six to nine mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in a facility where it took an
ounce to adjust our pH to the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: solution because we were using so much
water to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, I'm not sure how, but that doesn't
sound too, uh, too crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to nine mils doesn't sound like a lot
to move it a few points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also from looking at your plants,
it could be a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does kind of look like they're stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something and not getting fed and
something is stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also from looking at the plants,
it looks like they are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the leaves do when they're
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They curl down and they start to make what
I call the claw, the handy claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just squeeze in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an overwatering, which could
be coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're overwatering, it's going to
disrupt your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to really throw off everything
there in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves have a leathery tough wrinkled
look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that you should listen to
the episode about vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like those leaves are possibly a
little crispy, a little dry, like the air
[SPEAKER_00]: around those specific plants is too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, are they getting
overwatered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your pH meter accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are these plants sitting right in
front of the fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that are getting problems,
are they near the fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where you've got some ventilation
coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there different air right there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think could be causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pH, it's overwater, or it is
extreme airflow disrupting the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit right there around those
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to do more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to figure out what
you're going to have to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to dial it in a
little bit and see what is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I really do appreciate the great
email, Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we solved some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to more pictures and I hope
we're able to get your garden back up to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, dude, most of the garden looks
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got a few leaves like that,
you're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it starts spreading and going
rampant, we're going to have to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what's causing that and we're going to
have to fix it and correct it very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep me updated, keep me posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get your garden back up
to A plus condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think that is
enough emails for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've sent me an email recently or in
a long time and I haven't read it,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't worry, I've got a pile of emails
printed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been doing messages on the show
for a while, but I will get back to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I will work my way through this stack of
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be patient and keep the emails
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the interaction and I would love to
hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me all of your grow questions
and I will get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just may take me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, real quick, I want to throw out
some quick shout outs to Jade,
[SPEAKER_00]: Angel, Aldridge, and Tanner M.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, before I start wrapping up this
episode, I've got one more thing I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: rant about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a friend's garden the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of helping him do some things,
kind of teaching him some tricks and tips,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get his garden up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was mixing up his nutrients and he
simply picked up the bottle off the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: and he picked up a little measuring device
that he pours it into and he measured how
[SPEAKER_00]: many mils he needed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he threw it right into the gallon
or the five gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he just did the next one the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, shake the bottles,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the good stuff is in the bottom of
that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the heavy stuff that we're paying for,
all the stuff the plants want to eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably sinking right to the
bottom of your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a bottle, whatever it is,
if it's your grow, your micro,
[SPEAKER_00]: your bloom, whatever solution you've got
there, shake that bottle up before you
[SPEAKER_00]: pour it out because there's a lot of water
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's like 90% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to at least spread those inert
ingredients out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just want to give it the top
little water to where at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop you're feeding it all the chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever finished a bottle of
nutrients and then just had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky funky salty shit in the bottom of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably because you weren't
shaking it hard enough or enough often
[SPEAKER_00]: enough before you were using it when you
were mixing up your nutrient solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the salts just stayed in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just poured out the water and he fed
your plants 30 mils of mostly water
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of 30 mils of NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shake those nutrient bottles before you
pour it into your measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you're pouring the nutrients
into the water, I would just pour one in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then give it a little stir and
then pour the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pour them to where they touch
without being diluted by a bunch of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients are sold in two different
containers for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to let them mix until they hit a
larger container of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the two concentrated
bottles, those two products touching,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why they're sold
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shake them and then pour them in
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's start wrapping up this
podcast.

knowledge packed episode, but I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the equipment dialed in and I think it
worked for this whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out as I edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be back to the grow lessons really
soon.
