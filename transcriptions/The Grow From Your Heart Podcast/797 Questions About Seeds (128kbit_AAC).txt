Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back podcast world, I'm your host
Rasta Jeff this is episode 797 of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast I've got a fun
episode lined up for us in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right I've teamed up with seeds
here now calm to give away free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetic seeds We'll talk more about
the free seed giveaway later in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode This is the time when I do want to
remind you that team I read genetics will
[SPEAKER_00]: be at the dude grows cup in June on June
3rd in Fort Collins, Colorado I do invite
[SPEAKER_00]: you to come join us at the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out DG C cup calm for
all of that information Also, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you check out I read direct calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great things on sale on
I read direct calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of seeds and regular seeds
at blowout pricing for the month of April
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just added a couple of new strains
So make sure you go check out the website
[SPEAKER_00]: I read direct calm grab some of those new
seeds the fresh drops and the fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: restock at blowout pricing Alright,
I think that's all of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got to cover here at the top of
the show Let's jump into the email and
[SPEAKER_00]: questions portion part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a great question here right in
front of me This one came from the I
[SPEAKER_00]: redirect website with the question
submission form right on the I read direct
[SPEAKER_00]: website There is a tab that says grow help
or questions if you click on that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to send me a grow question And if I
do read that grow question here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast you win a free pack of I read
genetic seeds Of course that giveaway is
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored by our friends at seeds here now
calm So this first question from the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help tab came from our friend Brent and it
goes a little bit like This it says hey
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your work and I love every single
episode you have put out Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great compliment and a good way
to start an email It says I can't thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you enough for what I have learned from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge compliment Thank you for
mentioning that you've learned a lot from
[SPEAKER_00]: me Thank you for saying that and that is
all of the things I need What I would
[SPEAKER_00]: really like is that you just go in the
garden and kick ass and it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing that So that is the best way
to reward me or the patreon campaign Of
[SPEAKER_00]: course patreon.com forward slash grow from
your heart But letters like this messages
[SPEAKER_00]: like this and knowing that your garden is
better is all the thanks and reward that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do need But thank you for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going it says my question is
this What sort of growth characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: can you expect to see when you have the
same plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: One has a taproot started from seed and
one is a plant started from a clone Is it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically vigor and structure that will
differ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time buddy much love
from Michigan big shout out to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Brent in Michigan Thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a good answer for this one So
they're asking when we grow a plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time we grow it Obviously the first
time a plant is grown every plant comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from a seed it all starts from a seed The
first run is always from seed then from
[SPEAKER_00]: then we've if we want to repeat that plant
and grow that plant over again It's got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be grown from a clone We have to clone it
reproduce that plant keep that clone alive
[SPEAKER_00]: make more cuts keep growing the same thing
The question is will we see differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that plant from a seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus growing it from a clone,
which is a great question When we grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a seed we do get what is called a
taproot that plant develops that original
[SPEAKER_00]: taproot which is supposed to be that
original source of life for that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: dig into the Dirt dig into the roots
establish itself It gets nice and thick
[SPEAKER_00]: and it shoots straight down most of the
time the taproot tries to go down With the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant it wants to go down and
then they start spreading out once they've
[SPEAKER_00]: gone down far enough But that taproot is
the main difference in the clone and the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed or origin plant That is going to be
the main difference that does give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of more vigor Sometimes you'll
see if you plant a clone and plant a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time of the same plant That
seed will have a little bit more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that fresh life just trying to
express itself So the main difference
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see will indeed be that
that taproot is going to be your main
[SPEAKER_00]: difference other things You're going to
see are possibly structure and pattern and
[SPEAKER_00]: this does depend on a couple of things
You'll notice when you grow a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that main apical dominant top is
symmetrical it'll have branches coming off
[SPEAKER_00]: the left and the right and then I think
the easiest way to say it is northeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: then southwest and then or no north and
south and then east and west and north and
[SPEAKER_00]: south and east and West is the way that
the nodes will face that's when you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the Clones from the apical Maristan part
of the plant if you cut the clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: other branches of the plant You may notice
that those clones that those branches may
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate where the nodes shoot out It may
just go north and south north and south
[SPEAKER_00]: north and south It won't go north south
east west north south or what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it won't do all four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't do the plus sign It'll just do a
minus sign shooting nodes on opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: sides instead of all four directions That
is going to be one of the differences that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do see also This is going to relate to
another question that's coming up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast that I've previewed sometimes that
clone Sometimes the seeded plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: express some weird mutation some weird
funky growth in some cases I have seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone not do the weird shit that the seed
plant originally did and that's Hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: say if it was the plant doing something
different or maybe it was environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I put the seedling into soil that
was too rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I gave it too much light Maybe I
overwatered it and something went weird
[SPEAKER_00]: there and that plant got usually it's a
mutation like a twisty leaf or just
[SPEAKER_00]: something a weird structure a weird shape
something like that A weird reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't see that if I cut a
clone and run the clone again Sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the plants don't show me that
weird shit I feel like it grows out or
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said possibly it was something I
did to it the first time So sometimes we
[SPEAKER_00]: see differences in the entire performance
of the plant when it comes from that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just when I do run the
anomalies if the plants good enough to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a clone from and I do decide to run it
again Sometimes I have seen that those
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdos grow out of their weird shit in
the second and third run Let me see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I cover everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes The main difference is going to be
that taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a difference in the vigor Then
we may see a difference in the structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and shape and the pattern of the plant and
that all depends on where you cut it from
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it from that apical meristem,
you may get the all four direction nodes
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it from a side branch,
you're just gonna get the two branches
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the sides The seed plant
you'll notice is much more symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed plant wants to grow with symmetry
I do have some plants to make two tops
[SPEAKER_00]: just naturally on their own, but that's
also symmetrical you'll notice that from a
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend Brent I do want to
thank you for the great question since I
[SPEAKER_00]: read your question here on the air That
does mean that you win a free pack of iry
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic seeds Please send me a follow-up
email send it also if you can send it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the The same way that you submitted this
question go to the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your address Let me know where to
ship you a pack of seeds and please do
[SPEAKER_00]: include a real reasonable name I don't
want to ship packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got companies I love that you're
inspired, but I don't like sending
[SPEAKER_00]: packages to like ganja plant Joe and Like
weed head Bob 420 and stoner day 5000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys and I love your cool names
But sometimes that looks a little
[SPEAKER_00]: suspicious and people at my post office
may decide to look in your package or
[SPEAKER_00]: people at your post Office may decide to
look in your package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put our normal names on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just be cool I'm not gonna stalk
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna do anything weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me help you get your seeds to you
Alright, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you once again for the great
question Let's keep this show moving
[SPEAKER_00]: because I do get sidetracked and get quite
rambly this next question came from The
[SPEAKER_00]: grow help tab on I read genetics calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grow help tab is on I read genetics
calm and I redirect calm It's the same set
[SPEAKER_00]: of tabs at the top of the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just click on there That will get you
to the same grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our buddy Neal stir big
shout out to my dude Neal stir Thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Neal stir Send me your address
because I owe you a free pack of I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics seeds Once again, that seed
giveaway is sponsored by my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds here now calm the question goes just
like this it says Dear Rasta Jeff big
[SPEAKER_00]: salute keep doing what you do,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna keep doing it Can't stop won't
stop made it this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: No reason to quit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm finally trying some iry gear
Congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've got two gorilla goat sprouts
and two lemon Jeffries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great combination They're gonna
work very well together They're gonna both
[SPEAKER_00]: grow quite tall, but they're both gonna
make very unique and different aromas The
[SPEAKER_00]: the gorilla glue is gonna have more like a
sweet or the gorilla goat is gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: more sweet gorilla glue flavor And that
lemon Jeffrey is just straight pure lemons
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna grow well together,
but you're gonna have a nice variety when
[SPEAKER_00]: the harvest comes So that's a beautiful
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on it says I work in a commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the team, bro Then it says we
have two sets of 1212 rooms Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a daytime room running 11 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a nighttime room running 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: To 11 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right day and nighttime?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we've got 11 11 and 11 11 is their
schedules so they can divide The day into
[SPEAKER_00]: half and have two 1212 rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says why would we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any reason other than night shift
and possibly saving on electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't understand why they don't put all
of the lights on during the day And you
[SPEAKER_00]: can only get into each room for half of
the day as it stands So help me figure
[SPEAKER_00]: this out So the situation is our dude has
a commercial grow space works at a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow space and it's cut in half
and they run one half of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room on 1212 from 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: To 11 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that turns off Then they allocate
that electricity to the other side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room so that it can be on from 11 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: To 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could understand seriously how this
would be frustrating trying to schedule a
[SPEAKER_00]: workflow Employees don't want to be
anywhere at 11 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be at home in bed sleeping and
then for the transition to happen at 11
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that you've got to come in at
like 8 o'clock and get you get three hours
[SPEAKER_00]: in that one room and then the lights go
off and shift into the other room and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you get Whatever they're on all day,
but you only have so many hours left to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably hard Pain in the ass to
schedule working in there You probably got
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in at six or seven in the morning
to get shit done and the 11 the nighttime
[SPEAKER_00]: room So I understand why that's
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is all about why do I think
they're doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: My main assumption for why they're doing
this is to save on electricity They
[SPEAKER_00]: probably possibly likely I'm assuming do
not have enough electrical power to run
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire side the entire room all at one
time It's probably less load on me the
[SPEAKER_00]: transformers whatever is bringing in the
electricity I don't know what where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing your power if you've got three
phase power I hope you do in a big
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility, but maybe not so
maybe it's a power limitation Maybe they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't run it all because of the
electricity Maybe they don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioning to cool that many lights
all at one time And it's easier just to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool it down only running half of it Also,
you did state one thing a kilowatt hours
[SPEAKER_00]: are much cheaper during off-peak hours
Which means they charge more for
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity during the day the time when
everybody's at work when we're all up
[SPEAKER_00]: watching TV Running our coffee makers
running the TV running the grow lights on
[SPEAKER_00]: our own houses But at the office they got
all the lights on at the stores They've
[SPEAKER_00]: got all the lights on all the lights are
on everywhere you go because all the
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses are open That means that
electricity is more on demand which means
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what they charge more for it when
everybody goes home And everyone's just
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling late at night electricity gets
cheaper because we don't need as much of
[SPEAKER_00]: it So it's more cost-effective for a
grower to run the lights at night But it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a pain in the ass for a commercial
grow so I wouldn't recommend that for a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility Unless you've got a
dedicated night shift, which this facility
[SPEAKER_00]: does not have so the first assumption is
power limitations The second question the
[SPEAKER_00]: second assumption would probably be air
conditioning limitations other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure Why that would be an
effective idea why that would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my next move would be to ask
management ask ownership Hey, why do we do
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a night shift that will be
happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we gonna change this just ask very
politely like can we run both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms all at one time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what's gonna happen in my opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how hard you guys work I
don't know what you're capable of but this
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me think that you're gonna have one
room That's always growing like top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and another room That's just not as
good as the other all the time because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're only able to spend so many hours
that night shift room Whichever one goes
[SPEAKER_00]: off at 11 a.m You know if you come in at 6
You only get 5 hours to work in there if
[SPEAKER_00]: you come in it What you're not gonna get
enough time to work in that room or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones if you got an 8 or 10 hour
shift You're gonna have to divide up 5
[SPEAKER_00]: hours In each room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be you're not gonna get the
quality that you could if you just ran it
[SPEAKER_00]: all at once So my first question would be
do we have the power capabilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we run all of this at one time?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question would be do we have the
air conditioning capabilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next question is do they
think they've got the staffing?
[SPEAKER_00]: trained and available to do that if you
build an auto watering system and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to water every plant by hand if
you can just focus on Cut the clones on
[SPEAKER_00]: time get the clones transplanted into the
next pots get the small plants
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted into large pots have the
Large pots prepared in 30 days to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower room Then once they go into the
flower room You go back into the other
[SPEAKER_00]: room and you cut more clones and push
everything up into that space if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish that rhythm It shouldn't take a
lot of people to accomplish that rhythm in
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 85 to 115 ish lights that could take
one or two people I've ran a hundred light
[SPEAKER_00]: facility Plugs a hundred flowering lights
plus a veg room plus a mom area with
[SPEAKER_00]: myself as the lead cultivator and two
backup guys One guy to help me out every
[SPEAKER_00]: day the week and then on the weekends I
would take the weekends off And those two
[SPEAKER_00]: guys would run the ship on the weekends
plus a trim team Sometimes we did have a
[SPEAKER_00]: full-on trim team because that's a lot of
work, but the cultivation a hundred lights
[SPEAKER_00]: is one person with one or two backup
people helping That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I could train for So I'd see
if the staff has confident if the
[SPEAKER_00]: management has confidence and the staff if
not, let's automate some shit Let's get
[SPEAKER_00]: some auto watering going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn how to trellis more
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll turn out a pop and twist Let's learn
how to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn out a let's learn how to manage
the room the gear the equipment and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant To save ourselves time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much automation AI is going to
take over very soon Let's learn how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of that shit before AI pushes us out
of a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right My dude Neil stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered that one My once again,
my assumptions are power limitations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really don't do not know why I used
to have a room like this back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get rambling here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a an office It was like an
11 by 14 office space and in that room I
[SPEAKER_00]: put two five by five Grow tents,
but I wasn't able to increase the power in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room I could not run 2,000 watts of
light at one time, but I could run 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time with no problem So I bought a
device called a flip box and I plugged one
[SPEAKER_00]: ballast into the flip box and the flip box
then plugged into a Timer then went into
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds more complicated than it is but
what would happen is one ballast would run
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically a Y cable that would go for
12 hours it would go to tent B and then
[SPEAKER_00]: for the opposite 12 hours it would go to
tent a And there was just a little box
[SPEAKER_00]: that attached to my ballast that would
just redirect the power to which bulb So I
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to run I constantly had that room
flowering I had two five by fives
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering in that room And I didn't ever
have to overload the power that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like what they're doing here on a
larger scale But it's kind of a pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ass if you're not able to get into the
rooms I would ask them about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy ask questions See if we can
make shit better to let them know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only asking questions because you feel
like you could improve your performance If
[SPEAKER_00]: the rooms were on more even schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude Thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't forget to send me your
address with a real quality name So I can
[SPEAKER_00]: ship you a free pack of irie genetics
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right podcast world Let's keep this
party moving this next question came from
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend, Alabama man big shout out to my
dude, Alabama man Thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: continued patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that The question goes a
little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it says what kind of
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of question do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seven-year-old beans from nirvana
seed bank, which is pretty cool Where are
[SPEAKER_00]: you growing them indoors under LEDs
weren't veg were in week three a veg or
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was so proud to have germinated
seven-year-old seeds a while back Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes old seeds are a real bitch to
pop So I'm proud of you for having gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: those going it says they popped within 48
hours and responded well to normal
[SPEAKER_00]: feedings and lighting and always looked
happy but remained a little bit miniature
[SPEAKER_00]: and forum That could just been genetics
that could have been that they were tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been that they were old It
could have just been the kind of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were it does go on I topped the
plants at week three and it demanded more
[SPEAKER_00]: newts like normal but never sparked an
outward or upward growth spurt After week
[SPEAKER_00]: three, I yanked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a beautiful root system,
too I take meticulous care of my seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank, but everything like like everything
time took its toll I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's a good assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this It says what is the
oldest seed you have ever popped?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the seeds I have popped have
ever been super old if I'm gonna pop
[SPEAKER_00]: something It's probably something I
recently bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of eager to grow shit when I buy
it And I don't store seeds for a real long
[SPEAKER_00]: time I'd like to say no more than three or
five Maybe seven or eight years old did
[SPEAKER_00]: try to run some old stuff a while back and
like you only some of it popped up and a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of Things that did pop up didn't
look good What came out of it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff, but some of it just did not
look healthy So I understand what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to you most of the time I buy my seeds and
either grow them right away or if I Still
[SPEAKER_00]: got them it's because I've had them for
years and years and I'm not gonna grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them and I should probably give Them to
one of my friends to grow so we'll dig
[SPEAKER_00]: into the vault one day and share some of
that stuff It says should I trash all of
[SPEAKER_00]: my seven-year-old beans?
[SPEAKER_00]: No No, if you're gonna trash them at least
try to grow them before you trash them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could go wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Skip straight to the trash can and just
put them into a paper towel or however You
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate try that first then if they
don't work then put them in the trash But
[SPEAKER_00]: at least give them a try you may have some
fucking magic in those old seeds So they
[SPEAKER_00]: could be shitty even if they were new
That's something to think about those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when they were new they might have
been subpar seeds Not every seed is an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every seed is going to be top shelf
grow So even if those were new even if
[SPEAKER_00]: they were old they could have been
terrible They could have been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't attribute all of it to age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna blame it on age We're gonna
attribute that we're gonna say that you
[SPEAKER_00]: did everything you could and they were
just bad old seeds, but No, don't toss all
[SPEAKER_00]: your old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to grow them dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they do Instead of if you're
looking to grow two or three plants
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate Ten of those bad motherfuckers
and see what comes up power and numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get something super super cool
out of there old weed was really great
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the older weed was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you had back in the day might
be amazing So keep trying those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: could be even new seeds Sometimes they're
shitty sometimes I make a cross and the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will sprout and I can tell right
away like it We're not gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: release that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just you can see it sometimes So
who knows what you had who knows what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were now It says what a clone from the
same plant I pulled exhibit the same
[SPEAKER_00]: growth habits as it stunted Mother it
should technically genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientifically it should comma but
Sometimes like I said earlier some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those freaky ass plants the first time you
grow it if you cut a clone and grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone out It will do different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a plant that I put in a different
room recently It's never been in this
[SPEAKER_00]: environment before and I'm seeing
different shit from a plant that I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen before a lot of times It could be
about the environment that weird shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: saw could be like I said earlier It could
be hot soil over moisture too much
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity too dry Sometimes those seedlings
will tell you right away like there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking problem in here But then it'll
grow out of it and you'll cut that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: and the clone is the same age as that
original plant So if you've had that
[SPEAKER_00]: original plant for eight weeks,
and then you cut the clone that clone is
[SPEAKER_00]: technically eight weeks old It's still
continuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still got part of that age to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just grown out of that wonky shit So
maybe it won't go back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it does sometimes it grows out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a solid Definite infinite
answer for that because the answer is it
[SPEAKER_00]: should but sometimes just because that's
how genetics and nature work I can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: any promises when it comes to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Alabama, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question Don't be
discouraged with your old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw your seed collection away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still look good in the vault They
still count as a good collection and when
[SPEAKER_00]: you do try to grow them Maybe they'll work
and maybe they won't if you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: straight in the trash You'll never know if
they were any good or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep trying also Before we wrap this
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to recommend a product called
Herb it is spelled you are be it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit expensive But it does work very
well and helping get old seeds going also
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be creative and you want to
do a little bit of research on your own
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna leave this up to you a little
bit of gibberellic acid a little ga3 Will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely help get those seeds going but
you've got some work to do to check on
[SPEAKER_00]: that yourself There are safety precautions
to take there are a lot of risks involved
[SPEAKER_00]: when using the ga3 So be very careful if
you choose to go that route once again as
[SPEAKER_00]: a disclaimer as a safety measure As a
legal disclaimer be fucking careful.
