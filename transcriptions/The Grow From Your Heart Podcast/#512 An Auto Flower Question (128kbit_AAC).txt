[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog
Batter from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to open up the package and give
it a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has always been one of my favorite
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it smells this product and the
Stardog smell gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some funk to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that earthy, fuely, gassy aroma,
and I really love the buzz from Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the flavor, the texture,
and the aroma of this concentrate on the
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: The label says the product contains 63.2%
THC, zero CBD, and 74% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed this one because I love that
funky stink that's coming off of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I always love that Stardog buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take a break in the middle of the
podcast, I do plan on taking a big fat dab
[SPEAKER_01]: of this Orange Skittles Batter,
once again, from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one smells like funky orange
skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait to take a dab of this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's what we're dabbing on today's
episode.

[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks for all of the love and

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's talk about some stuff
that I have got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an amazing birthday weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: My birthday was technically on Sunday,
but I think we began celebrating around
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday and it is now Tuesday and it has
not stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't party hard, but I've been going to
dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going to lunches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to brunch, just been hanging out
with a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've got plans to go bowling with
some friends here and just a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been an amazing birthday weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was overloaded with birthday love.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Facebook exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Instagram exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: My text messages would not stop all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My phone kept ringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very blessed day to be Ross
DeJeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thank you to everybody who sent me
some sort of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my birthday, if it was a high five,
if it was a text message, if you just sent
[SPEAKER_01]: me a DM on Instagram, it all means a lot
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was overwhelmed with messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot begin to thank each person
individually because it would take me four
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast episodes to cover that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an awesome birthday weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of great gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of great time with friends
and that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go spend time with people that you love
and want to be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time with my mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time with most of my real
good friends have come around for my
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Clint has been sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's down with some fucking he doesn't
have the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he doesn't have that one,
but he's been pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when he gets better, he'll come take
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's just got to shake it off
and pony up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most everybody has been by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody got to come take some dabs or I
went and dabbed with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's quit rambling about my birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't your birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks for all the great birthday love
and support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, last week I put out an episode which
featured a very highly medicated white
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and we let Mike ramble for a good 40
minutes and I got a lot of response to
[SPEAKER_01]: that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on Mike's behalf, big thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both love and appreciate the comments
and the support and the response and the
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak for Mike when I say that
that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really energizing and really
refueling and it's motivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps us going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure Mike would agree with
that, but I don't want to put words in his
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can say that Mike says thank you
because that stuff does mean a lot to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for all of the other a lot of
YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot again, a lot of emails,
a lot of Instagram comments, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis comments about the last episode
where Mike went on a major ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never know how that's going to go over
when I put out 40 minutes of Mike rambling
[SPEAKER_01]: and you guys responded beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike, come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take another ridiculous fucking dab and
let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and by the way, I want to congratulate
Mike on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen him in a couple of days,
but the last time I saw him, Mike had been
[SPEAKER_01]: going quite a while without cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the exact day,
but I was fucking impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Mike for not smoking
cigarettes anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your health in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the right path.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to brag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had soda and I've had very
minimal sugar and caffeine for almost two
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half weeks now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're one of those caffeine
people, I was a caffeine people and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would overload myself on caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that I thought would
give me some more energy was more
[SPEAKER_01]: caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I'm not consuming caffeine,
I've never had more fucking energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're fighting that caffeine
battle, you're never going to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to clean your shit up and
stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to brag about my dietary
accomplishments, but I felt proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanted to share mainly big shout out to
Mike for fucking cutting out the
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we've inspired double door Matt to
chill out on his caffeine and Dr. Pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to all my friends for
attempting to take better care of
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting older, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not going to get any younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not just going to spawn
spontaneously, get healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to take care of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a fucking health and
motivation podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got on a ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking stoned from these dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is new in my life?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give you garden updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have made good friends with an LED
company and they have decided to offer me
[SPEAKER_01]: some lights to run in a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have recently hung up some Canon LEDs
from our friends at Black Sale Market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody over there,
working their asses off at Black Sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you guys working your face off a big
response, I know what it's like being a
[SPEAKER_01]: new startup company, being a
gondrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are so many LED companies out
there, and you are standing out,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that takes effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to run these LEDs, and I will
give you guys honest feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say that I made friends with the guy
over there, and it is important to me that
[SPEAKER_01]: I give my friend honest feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if these lights are amazing or
terrible, I'm going to give you amazingly
[SPEAKER_01]: honest feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to butter anything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let you know what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you that the moment I plugged
them in, I said, holy shit, those are
[SPEAKER_01]: bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I invited Double Door Matt over,
and I go, bro, look at these fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I plugged him in, and he just put his
hands over his eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, he was blinded for a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't trying to kill anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just so bright that it's
overwhelming, even for a grower who has
[SPEAKER_01]: been in a grow room all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put those two LEDs in a five by five
tent, and I'm still covering my eyes right
[SPEAKER_01]: now because I'm just thinking how fucking
bright it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tremendously bright in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to my buddy at Black
Sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't pay for any advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me lights and wants quality
reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: He deserves a shout out because he's a
cool fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Keith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to all the crew at Black
Sale Market.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I'm going to take a
fucking quick drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to keep recording while I
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice is doing something skippy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what it sounds like when you
hydrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, usually I edit that crap out,
but just be here with me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out at the table, take some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to dab, you can hit whatever's
on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got several options here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a dabber right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make yourselves comfortable, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't be too loud while we're on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you guys, I got stoned and I'm in a
good fucking mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to read a couple of
emails that some folks have sent us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy producing what I call
listener generated content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I know that I'm answering at
least one person's question out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least one person's need some help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figure if one person has this
question and they had the motivation to
[SPEAKER_01]: just write a simple email to me and ask
me, I figure if one person sent me the
[SPEAKER_01]: question, there's got to be at least 10
people out there asking, maybe 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows, maybe a hundred people out
there with the same exact question as this
[SPEAKER_01]: one person, whoever's sending whatever
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love creating listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking rambling, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of apologize, kind of don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm supposed to come talk on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my job, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just try not to be Mike this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm going to read an email because
I like helping my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first email on today's episode goes a
little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Rasta Jeff, I was hoping I would
get a chance to catch you out at the DGC
[SPEAKER_01]: bus and do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and Scotty Real are the only people
that I follow closely and I didn't get to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Scotty too though, and he gave me
and my fiance a DGC t-shirt, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my friend, Giant Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was at the Indo Expo and he was hoping
that I would be able to go out and smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: at the DGC bus because my friends at the
Dude Grows crew, that is the dude from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude Grows show, went Scotty Real and we
can't leave out Guru.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are so many folks in the DGC now
that I can't even start listing people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we got to mention JR Token and
Maestro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure I'm going to miss somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if I left you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you I took dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the DGC crew, the Dude Grows gang,
they got a smoke bus, which was equipped
[SPEAKER_01]: with rigs and seats and air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were outside dabbing out while I
was inside busting my ass at the
[SPEAKER_01]: iRegenetics booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not busting my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work up a sweat and I talk up a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not busting my ass.
I work up a sweat and I talk up a story.
It's not busting my ass.
I work up a sweat and I talk up a story.
It's not busting my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not busting my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, Scott?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's just saying hi to
everybody, and we all know each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we help each other out, and we all end
up going to dinner at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like that with the other Expo
people and our friends that come to see
[SPEAKER_01]: us, especially our friends that come to
see us from far away, our friends that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been supporting us for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to show you love.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes on to say, I watch the
Embracing Organics show regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys aren't aware, I am on
another podcast at least every other week,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's called Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be there every week, but I stay
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing every other week just
to keep myself fresh on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Embracing Organics is a YouTube show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is live on YouTube every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the mountain time zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for myself, it is 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start about 7-10.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all stoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 7-10, 7-15 when we get going
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go for about two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show stays up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't catch it live,
you can watch all the Embracing Organics
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm on that show quite regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to contribute my breeding and
cultivation knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've built a lot of great friends and a
lot of great relationships from that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it says, I watch the Embracing
Organics show regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sat down and did dabs with Keith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keith, that's the second time you got a
shout out on the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smoked with Stabby and the rest of the
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy, Stabby
McStabwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shot the show with Tonassi many times
and was even going to meet up later in the
[SPEAKER_01]: week to hang out with Tonassi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he got caught up with the funk at the
Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some people do get that Expo wook
flu, that cup cough sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that same wook flu tried to kill
Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took down a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have become immune to the wook
flu.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get the cup cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get sick from those events
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to do all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to come back fucking wreck from
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I just notice that I come back with no
voice because I smoke way too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take too many dabs and I talk too damn
much is my problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to focus on this email
because this is going to be a five hour
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast if I don't get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did dabs with Pedro and Dizzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Pedro and Dizzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pedro makes amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dizzy is a wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she makes good concentrates and
grows as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not sure her role in that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know she's a badass mom and that's what
fucking matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Pedro and Dizzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pedro hooked us up with some rosin and JR
Token gave us some of his cookie crumble
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke while we were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that awesome?
[SPEAKER_01]: You show up and people like, here's
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: High five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being our friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, wait, I follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you thanking me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because without you, people that
follow us and support us and show us love
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually click like and fucking do
things like that, send things to our
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon and help us out on PayPal
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't able to do what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just people with hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'd be a lunatic if you
weren't listening to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just be a fucking crazy person with
way too many toys and way too many gadgets
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I personally love it when I meet people
who support the grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's podcast or I read
genetics or anything Rasta Jeff related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate and enjoy all of those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love meeting you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure I know Pedro and Dizzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they love meeting people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it on their faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They light up and they smile and they've
both got a genuine smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that, oh, fuck, I got to talk to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to those places to meet people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of our it's what we want to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the mission is to go meet our
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, without you guys,
we're just a bunch of weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, so it was a really cool
experience for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it couldn't have been more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't have been more impressed with
the Colorado cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fly a thousand miles to attend these
events and check out the local scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you never know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spend a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get an Uber to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to make it to the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get there, you don't
know if the people are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly, if they're going to be total
dicks, if they act like rock stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if the event is going to be
a flop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really big gamble when you don't
know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, the Indo Expo is done very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend, Giant Mike, who sent this
message is very correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colorado cannabis community is very
welcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you guys coming here to visit us
and hang out with us and be our friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get some weirdos that come,
but we know how to dodge them and avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys that are cool, we love you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out, be our friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met so many wonderful people at the Indo
Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: This email goes on to say, we could never
have felt more welcomed, not just by the
[SPEAKER_01]: people at the Expo, but by everyone we
encountered in the cannabis community in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad my crew, my state, my people did
a good job and made you feel welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad the Embracing Organics crew was
kind to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could have taken a dab with you
in the dab bus, but that's just how it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time I'll make somebody else work the
booth while I go take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody wants to find me at the
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of, I feel like I should be
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message does continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, it was my fiance's first time and
now she is asking me every day if my boss
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to let me off so we can go to the
DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am glad that your wife, your fiance,
maybe your wife by now, I'm glad she
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyed it enough to be eager to come back
in April for the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only been a three month gap,
so she's already excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will take a dab at the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, that is at a consumption
friendly event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have my own concentrates and my own
rig available.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the booth, I'll be taking dabs on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come join me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Giant Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to take a dab and we will take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you uncomfortably high if that's
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wraps up with, hopefully we make it out
and get to do dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, hopefully, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you get to make it to the Dude
Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you where it is yet,
but it is in Denver and it is on April
[SPEAKER_01]: 18th and it will be very easy to get to if
you've got a hotel just about anywhere in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message wraps up with, thanks again
for everything you do, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we got a fist bump and a green heart
emoji.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: More green hearts back at you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers love gang gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: They signed the message with Giant Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Giant Mike, thank you for the
continued correspondence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the second or third
message I've read from you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I gotta press pause and take a
drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice is doing that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be right back after I get some
hydration going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab while I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, all right, all right,
I'm back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit some of that orange Skittles live
batter from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The THC is 66.7% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total cannabinoids is 77.2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cracking it open to give you guys an
accurate smell description.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I open it, it's funky oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't describe it better than funky
oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's orange, but there's something nasty
to it that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, Skittles with a Z so they don't
get in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live batter from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I noticed is it made my
eyes nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got those heavy eyeballs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms for getting me nicely
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned here on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've got one more email that
I'm gonna read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from our friend who calls
themselves David W.
[SPEAKER_01]: from STL.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends in the STL.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes a lot just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo, Rasta Jeff, thank you for all
of the knowledge you drop on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week, you are doing great things for
the community and the move, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out here trying to do what I can,
man, just doing my part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the motivation and for
acknowledging my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, Here is my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The supposed feminized seeds I got from a
dude I know ended up being auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in my garden along with a few
other photo period regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the autos have started flowering,
what effect would it have on them if I
[SPEAKER_01]: were to switch to a 12-12 light cycle for
the photo period regulars to start
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again from your friend,
David W.
[SPEAKER_01]: from the STL.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, you can use my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes things so much easier when you
give me permission to use your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our new friend, David, was growing some
seeds, which he thought were feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are probably feminized, but it turns
out that they are auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm assuming you think they're auto
flowers because they have probably auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowered while you've got them under a veg
light situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may have been caused because they
were root bound, but it is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate that they are auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the main question is he has got some
other plants in there that he wants to put
[SPEAKER_01]: into the flower cycle, but they are photo
period regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are going to require a 12-12 light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The auto flowering plants will do best
under a 16-8 or 18-6 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an auto flower guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't breed or grow auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that time period may be off,
but they do better with a longer photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period of daylight hours because they're
bred to flower without a reduced light
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what is going to happen if we reduce
the lights to 12-12 to trigger our photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period seeds into flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing you will notice is that
those auto flowers may slow down in growth
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit because they are not getting
as much light energy as they would prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been used to getting 18 or 16
hours worth of light all day every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've cut that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go, hey, I thought we
were going to get more light than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to act like they're not
going to grow as rapidly and as vigorously
[SPEAKER_01]: They may take a little bit longer to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they may take a little bit shorter
to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how they're going to respond
to this, but you won't get as much growth
[SPEAKER_01]: as you would have because the light,
the sun is the most effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: most desired nutrient for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the most important building block
for big buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to do the compromise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to reduce the light cycle enough
to encourage the plants to flower so they
[SPEAKER_01]: think that the season is ending.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have to give them enough light
to create big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can easily switch your lights to
12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those auto flowers will continue to
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just not going to see the
productivity that you would hope to see
[SPEAKER_01]: from those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my overall advice is to don't be
scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put those plants on 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get those photo period plants going and
then just move forward and get those autos
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be the most amazing
plants, but you will get something out of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let them finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to reduce the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not eat as much nutrients because
they're not getting as much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't metabolize and photosynthesize
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not going to be as active.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not even drink as much for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to the plants,
how they respond and how they react.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everything will be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just not going to get as much
productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the frequency and the
strength of your feeding solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank my new friend,
David W.
[SPEAKER_01]: from STL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have called you David from West STL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, thanks for the great message,
bro.
