[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 69 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back with another solo episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's hanging out with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me all by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I do need to send
you guys a huge apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there was an issue with the
last episode I posted to Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has since been corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna drop down that music a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode I posted to Stitcher went
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything went perfectly, but for some
reason, when Stitcher grabbed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it only took the first 14 or 15 minutes of
it, so for the first couple of days of the
[SPEAKER_00]: week, you guys were only able to access a
15-minute episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when the grow lesson came in,
everything cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher got it fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took him a couple of days, but Stitcher
did repair that for me, so big shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody who went back and
listened to that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys tried to listen and gave up
because it sucked, go back, and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 30-something minute episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cover most of veg growth, so now that
that's out of the way, let's move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received a question that I wanna answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me, why do you turn off the
lights during your foliar feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm using a bug spray or a foliar
feed, I turn off the lights because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you spray the plants with a liquid,
it makes little bubbles on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got these high-intensity
discharge lights right above them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it works the same way as if you took a
magnifying glass and shone the sun through
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes that little, I call it a
reflector bubble, and the magnifying glass
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sun work, and it makes that little
dot on shit, and then it burns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll create, you can catch paper on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a kid, I remember we used to
burn ants and shit with the magnifying
[SPEAKER_00]: glass using the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubble on your plants will do the
exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll create that magnifier bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light will hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll intensify the light beam into one
spot on your plant, and it will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: create a little burn mark on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a foliar feed or a bug
spray, I fully recommend you turn off the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ideal to do it right before the
lights go out if you can, but sometimes we
[SPEAKER_00]: have jobs and shit that prevent us from
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I turn off the lights when
I foliar feed, and that's why I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn off the lights when you foliar
feed or bug spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in my world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I was at the spot yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a couple hours out at the spot
dispensary in Pueblo West, and things are
[SPEAKER_00]: really moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be out there growing cannabis
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, we are waiting for inspections
from the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a couple small more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need, nah, not important stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a few small steps to get through
before I'm able to put plants in the spot
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and start growing recreational
cannabis that you will be able to come
[SPEAKER_00]: try.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you guys know when the plants are
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know when we put them into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you guys know when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you guys know when you can come
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, before we get to the grow lesson,
I wanted to talk about how much I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like my head is improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys follow the show, you know that
at the beginning of April, it hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a serious concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes at the beginning of April,
mid April were a little bit, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say they were shitty in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they were not up to the standard
I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not follow the format that I've
created, but honestly, I was not in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recovering from a major head wound,
but the good part is I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a week since I sat down to
record and it came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recording equipment came together
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: My podcast notes came together easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The notes that I wrote last week,
I brushed them up and made a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: sense out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good part is I feel like I'm getting
back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for sticking with
me through my head injury while I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a shithead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not been all here and I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys that have not
abandoned me and my show through that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, extra huge shout out to all the
people who have sent me love and support
[SPEAKER_00]: and well wishes telling me to get better,
telling me to take care of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people volunteered to come do
chores for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have no idea what that means to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting back on my feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been on my feet, but I'm
getting my head back in there while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the grow lesson,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written a bunch of stuff and I'm
going to try to condense it all into one
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may leave a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, just ask and
I'll go back over anything I went too fast
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to take a quick drink
and a dab and we're going to get on with
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, while I'm taking a dab,
make sure you support our sponsors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need organic soil amendments or
high quality worm castings, check out www
[SPEAKER_00]: .rockymountainwormco.com today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys, in the last episode,
I talked a lot about vegetative growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: we got right up to the first day of
flowering and that's where I want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: off today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start a flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let's talk a little bit about
the flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've alluded that there are three
trimesters to the flowering period and let
[SPEAKER_00]: me explain a little what I meant by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, we're going to talk about a
nine-week flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use Grateful Dog as an example
because it likes to finish in about nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, so that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first trimester is what I would refer
to as the transition phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second trimester is full flower and
the third trimester is the finishing and
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to talk a little bit
about what the plants want during each
[SPEAKER_00]: trimester and I'll do my best to break it
down week by week for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know what to feed and what
you can be doing to your plants each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find the main important things to do
to your plants each week and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give you some ideas that will really
improve your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in a future episode, we're going to
focus all about improving your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start a flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today would be day one of week one of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go to that Monday and I would say
day one of flower, week one, day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go through and mark that
calendar, week two, week three,
[SPEAKER_00]: week four, week five, week six,
so that it's easily viewable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to set the lights for a 12-12
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we want the lights to be on for
12 hours and off for 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted darkness every day and every
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have any dark during the night
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress any light during the night
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress how important it is to have
total darkness for the dark period of your
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room needs to be totally pitch black
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see any light in there,
it's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can stand in the room and put your
hand in front of your face, if you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand at all, you need more darkness
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's completely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's equally important not to interrupt
the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interrupting the dark period will cause
your plants to possibly herm and possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let them sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pisses you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I wake you up in the middle of the
night, it pisses your plants off too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running a 12-12 cycle, I like to keep my
metal halide bulbs in for the first two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first week of flowering,
I would feed my vegetative base nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would start pumping up my P and K
values.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also keep focusing on root
development a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were using bottled nutrients,
I would use a little bit of liquid karma,
[SPEAKER_00]: some silica blast, I would use a little
bit of humble honey and some roots ZHO or
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would add in some hygrosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect to see a whole lot of action
from the plants your first week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the start of the transitional
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is transitional phase from veg to
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about six to 10 days is where you're
really going to see your changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me add something here while I'm
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to get fed nutrients
on every Monday, but they're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get thirsty and need a drink
before the next Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be Wednesday or
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that day, water your plants with just
clean water, pHed at 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to feed every day because
then your plants are going to start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: over-fertilized and they are going to get
what we call nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your bottled nutrients are
salt-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep feeding these salts to our
plants, they get salty and they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to take up more salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply stop taking up nutrients and
that's called nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to feed clean water every
Wednesday or Thursday and prevent that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient lockout by giving these girls a
fresh drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to put us into week two.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week two, I would start feeding my
bloom-based nutrients and I would add some
[SPEAKER_00]: cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if you're going to use bottled
nutrients and this is what I would use if
[SPEAKER_00]: I were using liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a different brand,
all of these products are easily
[SPEAKER_00]: replaceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at your feed chart and look at
your other brand and replace the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week two, I would do some cow mag,
some liquid karma, silica blast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would add a little bit of c-plex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two is where you really need to start
paying attention for male plants if you
[SPEAKER_00]: started from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start seeing little ball
sacks develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got males in there, get them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week two, you should start seeing
pre-flowers and the plants are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of this week, you should have
identified your males and isolated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't plan on breeding,
definitely get those males out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them in the garage,
they may keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them somewhere, they may keep
going and make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill them unless you plan on breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on breeding, then I don't need
to tell you what to do with males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got that figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week two, they're pretty much just
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start seeing flower sets
start to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to see the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using feminized seeds,
still pay attention to the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shit could have gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have gotten the wrong seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take that feminized label as the
complete, this will be a perfect female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could not be the case.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three is a busy week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we really start getting
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have identified your males by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have pulled them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, if you had clones of those,
you tossed the clones of the males also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have nice bud sites
developing by the beginning of week three,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have a light leak or another issue
during your dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not starting to see little
dandelion looking bud sites by now,
[SPEAKER_00]: go in the room at night and make sure
you're not getting a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small light leak will prevent your
plants from going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week three, I would feed my
bloom-based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would introduce Fulvex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use Liquid Karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use Hydroplex.
[SPEAKER_00]: C-Plex, Silica Blast, Humble Honey,
and Hygrozyme this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the basic recipe through
flowering minus the Hygrozyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only Hygrozyme every other feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do add a few other things to my personal
mix, but this will get you guys through
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get too crazy and have you
buying a whole bunch of things when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get this mix from the Botanicare
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need help mixing up a great
Botanicare recipe, just go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the nutrient calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, fill it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It asks how many weeks you want to veg,
how many weeks you want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It asks you which bottles of nutrients
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click on those, and it'll tell you
what to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend reducing it just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed your plants a reduced mix and see how
they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always feed more, but you can't
un-feed your plants once they've burned
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the company, but they are a
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need you to buy more, so they kind of
tell you to use a little bit extra,
[SPEAKER_00]: is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you use, the sooner you got to
buy another bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's talk more about week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can go get that on the
Botanicare website is where I left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you're using a different
brand, they do have a different feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: chart online for you to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all the popular brands have a
feeding chart right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you can easily swap out
bottle for bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just read, like I said,
liquid karma, read the bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what's in there, look at whatever
brand you're using, and there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent for your brand is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all basically the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just prefer Botanicare if I'm going
bottled newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I also like to add a nice
dose of carbs and sugars at week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start seeing resin
production around week, midweek three,
[SPEAKER_00]: early week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little resin production, but it will
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not give it some carbs and sugars
to start contributing to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that carbs and sugars
keep the mycos in your root zone living
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthy and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is always a good idea to add those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in week three, we should really see bud
sites developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good time to start lollipopping
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is kind of cleaning up the
bottom, little mini buds and the sucker
[SPEAKER_00]: branches that aren't going to get enough
light to become viable buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and clean that shit
right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a whole lesson on lollipopping if
we haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light's only going to penetrate your
canopy about 18 to 20, maybe 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using regular thousand watt
bulbs, if you're using lower wattage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got even less penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant's three foot tall,
you don't need a whole three foot stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kind of clean off the bottom
12 inches or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives you more airflow down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds that develop down there are
just going to be wispy shit anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're going to make hash with it,
clean that up, send all that energy up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the plant because you don't
want to waste time trimming that bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to lollipop, clean up the
bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend switching from
metal halide bulbs to high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs at the start of week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three is the last week of the first
trimester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the last week of the transition
and stretching phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after this week, your plants will quit
stretching so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three is really the super stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then week four, they'll quit
stretching and start working more on buds
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in week three, you want to lollipop and
you want to change to your high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium bulbs are your main goals for week
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guys, I know I'm going kind of fast,
but we got nine weeks to cover here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm only two week four and we're 15
minutes in already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week four, I'm going to feed a very
similar mix that I would in week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week four is the end of the stretch phase
and the start of actual bud growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll really start to see buds developing
by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, you've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get in there and make sure
you've got darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't have some shitty
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week four is another week to lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely get in there and
lollipop a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use my thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trim my thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use that to pick off those little
sucker buds, collect them up, put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: a little trash can and toss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are put them in the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing that, those little sucker
buds are just that they're just little
[SPEAKER_00]: suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all that energy could go up to the
top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are growing for just hash,
you could do whatever you want with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's also a good time to start
adding stakes or some sort of supports to
[SPEAKER_00]: the branches because we're going to get
some hefty buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we get into week five and six,
we're really going to need stakes to
[SPEAKER_00]: support everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by week five and six, it's such a
bitch to maneuver those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your branches got long sticky colas on
there and you don't want to be playing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the resin and getting the resin all
over your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave that on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there about week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to put a stake to support the
middle cola because I know I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big, huge fat cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to put about four,
maybe six sticks around the pot because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get some big colas and I use
those sticks to strap up my major colas
[SPEAKER_00]: just right to the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do it early because like I'm saying
in week five and six, I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some buds going on that I don't want to
have to mess with so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I got them all strapped up already,
I don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm working with soil plants,
I usually don't use a trellis or a screen
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the dispensary where I'm running
the big grow, we are definitely using a
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to trellis the plants,
you need to get that in there during your
[SPEAKER_00]: veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when I was doing the veg
lesson, I mentioned that this is the week
[SPEAKER_00]: to do any type of trellising and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll have to happen in veg,
you guys, because those plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow up into that trellis and you don't
want to be bending them and folding them
[SPEAKER_00]: and manipulating them in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're making a schedule now
before we put these plants in the dirt or
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get your stakes up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your stakes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: More lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're doing for week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's transition into week five now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the fun starts, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants start getting photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds start getting chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're getting chunky buds,
it's a good time to stop foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk a lot about foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar feeding can lead to a lot of
problems if it's done incorrectly or at
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't introduced that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have gone on your own and
started foliar feeding, week five is when
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important to pay attention to
your humidity in week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: High humidity and big buds can be a great
way to create powdery mildew or other
[SPEAKER_00]: mold-related problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys that listened to the
podcast have heard me talk about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in a new room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a exterior wall corner that got
really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that corner pocket right there had a
lot of cold air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a five ounce white rhino plant
that I cut down and discovered powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew on one bud of it as I was cutting
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw the entire plant away.
[SPEAKER_00]: About probably five ounces worth of good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between four and six ounces is
what those plants were averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those five ounces that my patients did
not get to enjoy because I let it get
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let your room get too humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: My problem was that it was cold and I was
letting cold air mix with the warm air and
[SPEAKER_00]: that created mildew in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit will never happen to me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guys, if it happens to you,
don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you deal with it is what makes
you the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your best to get the humidity under
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want too much humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not wanna start getting mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week five, I would recommend getting
your humidity right around 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it to 40, there's nothing
wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're gonna get problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too low of humidity, your room's gonna dry
up kinda quickly and the buds don't get as
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the option or if you're
stuck with one, if you have to go too high
[SPEAKER_00]: or too low, definitely go too low of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about getting rid of the
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading notes as I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is where I would stop
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, week five, don't lollipop
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can if you want to, but you should
have gotten all that taken care of by now
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're just gonna kinda shock the
plant if you keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may, if you keep lollipopping and
fucking with the plant this far in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may cause it to stress out and herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what other stress
you're giving to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should have a room full of sexy,
chunky buds by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna start falling over and
needing attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've got plenty of sticks
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in there paying attention every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna go in there one day and
you're gonna find a bud that you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: notice and it's gonna be straight sideways
looking like it's ready to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's gonna happen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna learn all these things
over a couple of grows of what to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll learn to stop panicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see a problem, guys, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying that, but if you
freak out, you're just gonna make it
[SPEAKER_00]: worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see a problem in the grow room,
just take a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fix it, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, we'll just make BHO out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for week five, I like to add a really
strong dose of sugars and carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite bottled products is
Humboldt Honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that at week three, but I use a nice
fat dose of it again at week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for week five, you want to make sure
you've got your supports in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't done it in week four,
you may need to add a few more sticks in
[SPEAKER_00]: place for week five to get those bigger
buds up in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do, I put, I think it's a six foot
tall bamboo sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a big plant, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a six foot tall bamboo stick toward
the outer edge of the plant because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to disrupt too much of the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just shove it right into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I grab the bud that needs some
support and I use, I've used several
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, but right now I'm using,
they call them fuzzy sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a whole bunch for really cheap,
so I bought a shit ton of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a, it's a pipe cleaner,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a really long bread tie that you
can handle better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just take that and I wrap that right
around the stock of the bud that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, maybe I'll do part of the bud,
just depends on how heavy the bud is,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I feel like it'll break the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I take that and just wrap it
around the bud or the stock and wrap that
[SPEAKER_00]: around the stick itself so that it's just
strapped right up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got a broken finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give that sucker some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't want it falling over and
breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your whole goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you tip it a little bit,
if it's at an angle, it's a good idea
[SPEAKER_00]: because then you can expose more of that
bud to the light instead of just having it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tip it, you get a little more
surface area for that light to hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will increase your harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week five, you want to work on your
supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to feed some sugars and carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to monitor your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it around 50 to 40% and keep it there
because you're going to start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: chunkier buds and you don't need mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to stop foliar feeding,
all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's going to happen in week
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to move us into week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week six, I would feed a very similar
recipe as I did in week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd use high amounts of P and K and lots
of sugars and carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would reduce my base nutrients and focus
on resin production and healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week six will be our last full feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buds should be chunky and the resin
should be starting to cover the buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: the small leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a strain that purples
up, now's a good time to lower the temps a
[SPEAKER_00]: few degrees during the night cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep my grow rooms about 77 or 74
to 77 degrees during the light period.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the dark period, I try to get it
down to about 68, 69 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in week six, if I'm working
with something that will purple up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, like the Kalanji Kush or the
Flow or the Ghost OG or the Grateful Dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would drop the temps down just a few
more to like 65 degrees, maybe 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get to that 65 at night,
you'll see it in a night or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will start to purple up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will turn purple for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher CBD plants, I think like more cold,
but that's just my experience with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tora Bora and the Night Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a totally different plant,
so don't take that as a rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might wanna lower the temps just a
little bit if you're trying to pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: the purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more Sativa dominant plants,
this would probably piss off the Capelton.
[SPEAKER_00]: The White Widow would not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey would not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put those in the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kushy plants, Indica dominant plants,
give them a little bit of cold and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: purple up for you about week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to use more air
conditioning, so that may cost you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, but I think it's worth it for
the plant that enjoys that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week seven's a great week for
photography, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got big chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is however your last feeding,
so whatever your plants are lacking or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you haven't gotten in there,
this is probably your last chance to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to feed on week seven,
but we're not going to feed the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just gonna give a little bit of
stuff to keep it alive and happy and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically work on a good feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower your temps if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got everything supported
and staked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure nothing falls over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going through every single week,
you guys, and check for herms,
[SPEAKER_00]: check for males, check for issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say this also, every day,
if you can do it every day, go in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and grab each plant and just grab
one leaf and flip it upside down and
[SPEAKER_00]: inspect the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any signs of bugs, any kinds of
pests, that's when we need to get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and really deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're not too far into flower
by the time we discover a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flower when we discover
pests, that's a whole other conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you have to decide,
are these pests going to ruin my garden
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can I eradicate these pests somehow?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of decisions to make in
that scramble mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a whole pest management episode
in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week six, we have lower the temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our last big feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you took a lot of pictures in
week six because week six is photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we start what I've been
calling the third trimester.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ripening and the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't feed most of our nutrients this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would only use the humble honey for the
yucca extract and the sweetener in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really going to make your plant
sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make them dense up and it's
going to make them taste good and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make them stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also use sea plex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sea plex really contributes to the
aroma and flavor of a kush dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of sea plex in your cushions plants
will bring out that funk, that feedy
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grateful dog loves sea plex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing grateful dog,
when you crack it open, there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: offensive odor that comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost foot-like, it's almost
armpit-like, and it has a scent of fuel to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you pump up the sea plex or a
sea kelp based product when you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog, it will definitely increase
that funky ass terpene you're getting out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using humble honey, sea plex,
hygrozyme also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like enzymes at this phase to start
breaking down dead material, dead roots
[SPEAKER_00]: that have maybe died and need to be
decomposed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hygrozyme will help eliminate that
shit and speed things along for the flush
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also add some fulvex if you want to speed
things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our friend Sean taught us that you can
use OGT to speed up the flushing phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants because the rock phosphates
make the plant cycle too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It speeds up the nutritive cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will kind of assist us in the
flush phase if we'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not use any of that shit like Final
Phase or Clarex or any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that stuff leaves a little bit
of a flavor in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also believe that if we are growing
properly and we're flushing properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't need that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just another product to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, we are filling the
plant with salts and those flushing agents
[SPEAKER_00]: are basically sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And complex sugars break down salts,
which would break the bond of the salts
[SPEAKER_00]: around the root base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would allow cleaner absorption of
the roots and everything would just taste
[SPEAKER_00]: better and it would flow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that they're necessary
unless you fucked up at some point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very close to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to start getting the excess
nutrients out of our buds before we cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them down and prepare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to start getting the nitrogen,
the phosphorus, the potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: the manganese, the calcium, the magnesium,
all the shit that we've been shoving into
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get it out of there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that moves us into week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week eight is the official beginning of
the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do, and this kind of
depends on your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have smaller pots, you can move the
pots to the bathroom or the shower,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw a cinder block, put something down
so you don't scratch up the bathtub or the
[SPEAKER_00]: shower, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a towel down, throw a cinder block or
a bucket right in the bathtub or the
[SPEAKER_00]: shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're using a three gallon
pot, I like to run about nine or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right through that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds excessive, but what
you're doing, you're washing the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get all of the nutrients that
we've poured into this plant through the
[SPEAKER_00]: past seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to rinse all that shit out of the
dirt now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has been eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to kind of starve the plant for
the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using bigger pots, it might not
be feasible or rational to drag them to
[SPEAKER_00]: another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a seven gallon pot, I usually pour
about a gallon and a half a water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water through it and just let it fill up
in that little tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use a shop vac, a wet dry vac
to go suck the water out of the trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds excessive, but I really
like to clean out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this method doesn't work for you,
well, you have to really focus on when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want water to come out of the bottom
of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need like, I would like to say at
least 10% of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see that come back out of the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know I'm actually flushing
that plant and pushing something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing's coming out of the bottom,
nothing's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get water to flow to get all
those nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to want to do that
without drowning your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to flush it,
let it kind of dry, and then flush it
[SPEAKER_00]: again as many times as we can until the
end of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the week eight is the start of
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to water the shit
out of it on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be ready for water again
until probably Thursday or Friday,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you watered it so heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be in too much of a rush to water it
again because you will drown the damn
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Thursday or Friday when you water it
again, do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of water, just lots of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it go right on through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it drain right on through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got like a floor drain or
something, just keep pouring water
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't over flush in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ideal to use three times the volume
of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a nine gallon pot or a
three gallon pot, you want to use nine
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a five gallon pot,
you want to put 15 gallons of water
[SPEAKER_00]: through that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what I said?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five gallon pot, 15 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 gallons of water, three times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just making sure I'm doing good math here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head injuries coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush really good, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bitch a lot about cannabis because it's
improperly flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're smoking a joint, if the joint
won't stay lit, if you have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: relighting it, there's a good chance it
wasn't flushed properly or I rolled it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't roll with this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your ashes are black and chunky,
there are still nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a nice clean white ash that's
nice and smooth and soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want chunks of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ash into your hand, it should feel
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should almost enjoy that nice smooth
texture of the ashes if your plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: flushed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my biggest complaints about
dispensary cannabis, and I am trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: fix this in my shop, they don't flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not flush and they do not cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretty much say, shit's done,
cut it down and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to change that where
I'm working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing is important, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from week eight, you want to flush,
run plenty of clean water through that
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week nine, flushing is in full effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week nine ends at day 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day 60, here's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in the grow room and start taking off
all of the big fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf that has a petiole, that's a
stem, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf that has a stem that you can get
to, take some scissors and cut that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: off really close to the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in there and de-leaf the entire
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need these leaves anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to save you time when it
comes to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day 60, you walked in there and you
took off all of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I do in my grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three days left, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: On day 61, I reduce my lights from 12,
12 to 10, 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on for 10 hours and I'm off for 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going, oh shit,
he's going to kill us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time is near.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, I'll drop them down to eight
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on day three, I'll give them 24 hours
of total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day 63, no light at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave them off for the entire day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 64, wake up bright and early,
nice and ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in and cut down the entire room and
just let them hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's harvest day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 63 or 64 days, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine weeks of full flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got through that in 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have to kind of skip a couple of
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to talk right through this,
but I got a throat thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a drink here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you guys through nine weeks and 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left some stuff out, but I feel like
that leaves me more shit to teach you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more tips to give you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll survive a crop with everything I
taught you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I should mention,
if you do grow a longer strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend reducing the light to 11
hours on and 13 hours off around week
[SPEAKER_00]: nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only if you're growing something
that takes 11 weeks or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sativas won't finish up without a
shortened day period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is they are from an area that
only have a few hours difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural day and night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to encourage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just burped right into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to encourage these plants to
finish up by shortening the days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when we shorten the days is
the plant realizes that winter is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: and our plants main goal is to pollinate
and create seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it hasn't received any pollen,
it's kind of being stubborn about
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I really think it's like a dude
at a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thinks if it hangs out late enough,
there's still a chance of getting laid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we got to do, is we got to start
messing with the lights and tell these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, your time's up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to turn, tell the girls actually,
we got to turn the lights down and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start finishing on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, some of these sativas will just
keep on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Durban poison strain that went for
14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was getting tired of that bitch
because I needed the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, I was done growing that strain
in that crop and I wouldn't finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, well, why don't I just
reduce the lights down a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: speed this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, within one week of reducing
the lights, it finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to tell it so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also you may want to feed for a little
bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a longer plant,
I would extend the week six regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to extend anything,
just repeat week six until you get to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you have three extra weeks,
just do week six, three extra times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, my voice is burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit more stuff here,
but I'm running out of throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to do another 35
minute show and wrap this bitch up,
[SPEAKER_00]: put a bow on it.

this and you didn't tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will make a lesson out of that just
for you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I apologize that my throat is
burning out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to sound like shit
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can tell that my head's
getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered a product from on it.com called
Alpha Brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to Joe Rogan or any of those
other podcasts, you've heard about Alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: Brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha Brain is used by public speakers and
lecturers and folks in that type of a
[SPEAKER_00]: position that have to speak, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they say that Alpha Brain,
it's a nootropic and it is supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your ability to recall names and
facts and locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's supposed to broaden your
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that'll improve my head injury
and fix all my problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
