[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um I've noticed something you guys in the
podcast episodes that I put on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the text gets wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put like visit the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edit those shows I make pretty damn good
sure that the things are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try real hard, but sometimes I've
noticed that After the processing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: video some things go weird In the video
processing and they don't post the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that they looked on the screen originally
Thank you for letting me know that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I post stuff like support us on
Pat I should say support us on patreon But
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an update on Final Cut Pro and
some shit got weird and they fixed it I
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's been another update so we'll
see but it looks good on the screen when I
[SPEAKER_00]: type it in I made sure like I double and
triple edit and then I watch it back and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I put it up on YouTube,
I guess it's happening when the file
[SPEAKER_00]: processes and compresses anyway Thank you
to the people who told me that I put visit
[SPEAKER_00]: the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what a website is That's
supposed to be a website, but apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: something in Final Cut Pro wanted to make
a new word So make sure you check out my
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com Anyway, thank you to
my friends who gave me the I'm a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: grammar Nazi a grammar troll So thank you
for pointing out my errors and my
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Final Cut Pro fucked me on that
one It was autocorrect got me bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed stop sending me messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward I do have patreon

read Billy podunk's message I want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: him some love as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm filled with love in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't go wrong when you're filled with
love That's a good thing grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart breathe with love spread love spread

[SPEAKER_00]: I am enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm satisfied I'm blessed with life and
without all of the army soldiers This iry
[SPEAKER_00]: army wouldn't be what it is without the

[SPEAKER_00]: I feel all sappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna read this fucking message big
shut I'll tell my friends who show me love
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with love today you guys Anyway
from Billy podunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I do have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a pack of your daybreaker f2s So a
while back I made daybreaker f2 daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: is from gauge green genetics daybreaker is
a cross of Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite strains that I was
gifted seeds of I was given seeds of that
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time ago I bred it the daybreaker
is one of the parents of the Arise arises
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my flagship Maybe famous strains if
you want to call it that it tests real
[SPEAKER_00]: high in THC arise is a female golden goat
pollinated by a male Daybreaker plant I
[SPEAKER_00]: use the daybreaker for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this I've got a pack of
your daybreaker f2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a daybreaker male and Daybreaker
female I let them pollinate each other
[SPEAKER_00]: They were filled with love and then we had
seeds out of those seeds came some f2s
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds were f2s the second filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some of those seeds and I passed
them to some friends Billy podunk got some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a five pack of daybreaker f2s It
says I want to maintain this if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I really like but that is not
something I normally do so Billy would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to preserve and maintain these
daybreaker f2s But he's not normally a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone cutting type of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do virtually no cloning But I see that
it is probably I see that is probably I
[SPEAKER_00]: get okay Let me read that again because I
do virtually no cloning But I assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is probably what I will have to do as a
part of this project Sorry, I had to edit
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little bit there, but we made it
make sense Yeah, it's always good to know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to clone you have to get on top of
your you don't have to but I recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: get on top of your clone game learn how to
clone and Rapid routers and little like
[SPEAKER_00]: the tray the rapid routers and the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most affordable cost-effective
simple way If you want to spend some money
[SPEAKER_00]: on it make it a science project get
yourself an easy corner a turbo cloner an
[SPEAKER_00]: aero cloner They're all basically the same
get a good quality product and you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that But I would recommend strongly that
you learn to clone What if what if you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow one of these daybreaker f2s and it is
the perfect medicine for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it makes you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect what if it fixes all of Your
ailments what if it makes everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: hurts not hurt what if it makes all the
sick not sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it makes all the pain not pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that but what if this is
the greatest herb you've ever smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really gonna wish you had another
clone of it because you're gonna want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it smoke it and enjoy it and be
pain-free again So I recommend learning
[SPEAKER_00]: how to clone that is something I recommend
in the beginning once you get good at
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the next thing you do is learn how
to clone so you can grow again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but um You're gonna have to learn to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm also open to making seeds,
but I have not done that intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: before which makes me think Maybe before
bro, you may have made some accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be growing these in cocoa using
your feed schedule What is your
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended approach to this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, I think I will want to use
these to make seeds at some point as I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to avoid using mother plants for as
long As it will cut into my six plant
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that for a minute,
too Once you find the keeper I would the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I would go about this is I would grow
the five plants and find the keeper out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there Find the male and the female because
you might want to breed with these but
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely Find the male keeper out of
there learn how to clone it then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: only got one plant working as your mother
plant you can cut Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got six plants What I would do is I
would have a four or five plant perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: growth where you've got one mother plant
per se You're taking clones off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: every two three four weeks However,
you set your rhythm and then put a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in the veg room every two weeks Let it veg
for however long your cycle will set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that fits around your six plants
and your size Of your space is really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be be key But always have plants
in rotation to where one is two weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: once four weeks in one is six weeks in one
Is eight weeks in and one gets chopped
[SPEAKER_00]: down today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could set that up one mother plant and
five perpetual plants You could make that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen cut down four plants have one in
veg at all times You could set up that
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythm if you put some strategy and
thought into it You got 70 day cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: divided by how many numbers of plants
there you go That's how many days apart
[SPEAKER_00]: your cycle should be how long do you need
to veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just a matter Of how long do
you need to do the math equation or X
[SPEAKER_00]: equals?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do I veg Y equals how many plants
just do an equation figure it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how you work around the mother
plant and the low count or use that veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for a mother plant at the same time
while it's Vegging it's growing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cut the top off of it get the top
cloning as soon as that top makes roots
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant has recovered by then from the
top and you can put that into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat that process grow that next pitch
out real big top it move into flower grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that top out move it put into flower you
can keep doing that not after Waste a
[SPEAKER_00]: waste a mother plant space All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said real quick on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back on track if I'm going
to make seeds After going through what I
[SPEAKER_00]: have with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible or worthwhile to make some
smaller plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not talk about that yet my
recommended approach the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: approach honestly is learn how to make
clones find a keeper and keep the best
[SPEAKER_00]: female out of here and Turn that into like
a production female and make that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can grow that forever and ever
However, you may want to preserve this we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked in a previous episode about
preservation Then I would say find a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in this pack of seeds a man You've
only got five to work with so you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: find two maybe three males find the male
that is short squatty doesn't flower too
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and smells like Puke and mothballs
is the one I would go for find that male
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the girl that looks like what you
want find the girl of your choice out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this pack of seeds Pollinate the two pull
the seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the quick Easy way to go
about making more seeds and preserving it
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding it To get more seeds and now what
you're making f3 and you're gonna narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: down the traits that you're looking for
Honestly, do learn how to clone is the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you should go about this and I can't
say should I couldn't I shouldn't should
[SPEAKER_00]: on you But to it's what I would do bro If
you want to be a great grower and have
[SPEAKER_00]: this genetic around forever cloning is the
way to do it We talked in the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode about making feminized seeds as
well if you find that female that you
[SPEAKER_00]: really like you can use the advice from
the Last episode to definitely make
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds to for preservation of
this now there are more parts to this
[SPEAKER_00]: question I want to talk about If I'm gonna
make seeds after going through what I have
[SPEAKER_00]: with these plants Is it possible or
worthwhile to make some smaller plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with a shortened veg period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that provide me with a decent amount
of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right the shorter Veg period veg
periods up to you if you want something
[SPEAKER_00]: more vigorous You just have to breed
things that are more vigorous find one
[SPEAKER_00]: that veggies with high Pervigor and breed
to that that's how you breed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that you want quicker veg quicker
flower Find plants that veg quickly flower
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and breed to those that is how to
put that trait in the mix Then you'll make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds find the next generation find the
seed in that batch that does what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep breeding You'll isolate that
trait dial in that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get to quicker vegging
quicker breeding It's find the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: does it and breed to it Will that provide
me with a decent amount of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a lot of seeds Off of a small
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes a one gallon pot with a female plant
that is pollinated at the right time We'll
[SPEAKER_00]: net you plenty of seeds to play with for
the rest of your life If you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: play then sell them that you'll have
plenty of seeds Do you have any pointers
[SPEAKER_00]: on these plants as well as what you might
think would come out of the f3?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generation I'm in the process of planning
this project and I want to make sure I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in a position to take advantage of these
beans I really appreciate the forethought
[SPEAKER_00]: and preparation into a pack of seeds most
people they buy seeds and they Start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them and once they're in a cup and
falling over then they get a book and
[SPEAKER_00]: start asking how to grow So this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Billy podunk for having some
forethought here, but Any pointers and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I think would come out of the f3 if
you breed with a big wide-leafed female
[SPEAKER_00]: and a short stocky male They both have
that burnt rubber tennis balls vomit kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a mothball sort of array of aroma and
flavor You'll make a beautiful og cush
[SPEAKER_00]: cross that a short squat II if you get the
right male That flowers in the right time
[SPEAKER_00]: and the right female that flowers in the
right time You could bring these down to
[SPEAKER_00]: nine weeks and have a solid nine week
finisher Rock-hard dense buds that smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like feet and fuel and just this nasty bar
puke trash can sort of thing That's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect from it Super potent put you
in the couch sit you on your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would expect from it
Honestly, if you do it, right it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about selection though You could pick
totally different plants than me and come
[SPEAKER_00]: out with a completely different outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about that selection I hope
that's a real solid answer on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna skim this make sure I give you
an answer First part learn how to clone
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part find a male pollinate a
female make seeds Or run a perpetual grow
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're using the mother plant as the
veg plant at the same time That's another
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it Pointers for the f3 that's
all about selection short squat II plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with big leaves is what I would go for in
this cross A lot of seeds you can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of seeds in small plants I also want
to say that I greatly appreciate Your
[SPEAKER_00]: discord community has quickly become a big
part of my life every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lurker I don't participate in the
discord a lot because I've got a lot going
[SPEAKER_00]: on but I see you there every time I log in
if I go to check an auction on Dave's a
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dave for doing auctions on
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Dave's auctions on
the discord channel There will be a link
[SPEAKER_00]: to the discord channel in the description
But every time I go look our buddy Billy
[SPEAKER_00]: podunk is there just hanging out having a
great conversation So thank you,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that I thought it was
really great for graybeard to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition for managing such a positive
and productive community Yes, graybeard
[SPEAKER_00]: got a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also graybeard check your mailbox bro,
because you did get an iry gift So you got
[SPEAKER_00]: something coming to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure to take care of our
friends on one last note I've been mildly
[SPEAKER_00]: obsessing over one of your discontinued
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there's a place I might score
some dub wise seeds Thanks again and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: up the incredible work from Billy podunk
unfortunately our friend Billy podunk Dub
[SPEAKER_00]: wise is forever Discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will check my personal vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to send me a message to give
me a bump and remind me I'll check the
[SPEAKER_00]: vault honestly, but I don't think there's
any left even in my personal vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a hot seller I was a femme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I kept any I'm not much for
hoarding lately the seeds I've been trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them out if I realize I'm not gonna
grow those I get them out to the people to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them if I've got them, bro They're
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd send you a pack of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind me keep on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me forget I'm reading the notes
That I sent yeah, I told him and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: replied to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading the reply says sorry to break
your heart But dub is forever put to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I find any dude when I'm digging
through my my stash, I'll hook you up All
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna move on to the next question
Recently, I talked about auto watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody asked me for more details on auto
watering I realized I left something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna read this message and talk
briefly real briefly about it Let me make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure not to read too much of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my name shout out to our
friends Stash drop nothing extra needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks and much love for what you
do and for the community I'm glad to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to kick back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much and my grow has made
tremendous gains since becoming a faithful
[SPEAKER_00]: listener, bro Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a quick shout out to white Mike some
of my favorite podcasts are when you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are together and keep on killing it Thank
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that Mike will hear this
big shout out to cracker Mike So my
[SPEAKER_00]: question and you can use this on the show
or not, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the show here We go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What watering system do you use or have
you use or can you recommend or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: just build your own setups?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty handy, but also a visual guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point of right there So let's
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said just to add I'm looking for a
little more automation watering feeding He
[SPEAKER_00]: says I'm here to hand feed, but I'd love
to see how that makes sense where I get it
[SPEAKER_00]: You're there to hand feed But if we could
automate feeding and focus on cracking
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting popping the lolly popping
defoliating scouting for bugs Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could just do more shit if we have
machines Doing other shit I get it So
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about what I missed in a
previous episode talking about auto
[SPEAKER_00]: watering and I did recap on this just a
little bit if you want to Provide a really
[SPEAKER_00]: simple solution for auto watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build a really easy auto watering
system I talked about that in a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a pump You got some tubing that
goes to basically a homemade manifold
[SPEAKER_00]: which goes to spaghetti line Which goes to
emitters which goes to the pots you put
[SPEAKER_00]: down a timer ding-ding water the plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy If you're a handy,
dude, you could knock that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not the super handiest
construction worthy maybe if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: accident prone maybe for like me and You
know that there's a company out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a lot of time making a product
researching it Developing it finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking mistakes and flaws and getting
it perfect and before they sold it to us
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd rather do than fuck around
and try to build my own product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do podcasts I play the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not good at making auto watering
systems for my home grow I can do it but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there are other people that can do
that So that's when I would go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: product like an auto pot system Auto pots
are a great system for somebody who wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to just provide themselves with a quick
auto watering system Auto pots hempy
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets something like that are wonderful
for you So that's what I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to our friends at Auto pot USA
Give them a check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are friends of mine I'm not even
using the products right now, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been really thinking about it and really
considering putting one room on auto pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing if I enjoy it because the
summer Is coming and after a a kovat
[SPEAKER_00]: summer this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sitting around all year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go do some shit I don't want
to be here watering all the time So some
[SPEAKER_00]: auto pots where I could get away would be
awesome now that I've recommended the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: pots something I must say auto pots are
fucking awesome Until you knock over that
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir don't knock over the reservoir
Keep that thing full keep it nutrient and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it pH balanced Maybe stir it but
don't knock it over because that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only time I've seen something go wrong
with the auto pot system We had a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: knock over that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are, bro Big shout out
not gonna say your name, but don't knock
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucker over Once again, they don't
pay me to say that but the auto pot system
[SPEAKER_00]: has been looking like a great product to
me Auto pots hempy buckets some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: sip system is really easy It comes with
all the shit in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you really insist on building an
irrigation system They do make some pre
[SPEAKER_00]: designed irrigation system You can find
them at your big box hardware stores
[SPEAKER_00]: locally or if you're smart enough You can
just reverse engineer that build it for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you need Again, my advice I say
this every time we talk about auto
[SPEAKER_00]: watering systems by a second pump If you
plan on auto watering and that's your
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable system by a second pump quite
often that pump will die Unexpectedly
[SPEAKER_00]: without warning it goes pump pump pump
pump pump pump and then it makes this
[SPEAKER_00]: noise And you're fucked it doesn't warn
you it just dies they're done so they
[SPEAKER_00]: seize up and they're over get a backup
because you don't want to be watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: have It's not the end Of work Bell that's
the you're fucked today Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a backup pump have that on hand
like a hundred bucks at the most I know
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you don't have a hundred bucks,
but it's gonna help you out You'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto water you have to hand water if you
fuck it up I'm rambling but I do have one
[SPEAKER_00]: more message for you this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want their names said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this person wants their
name said so we're gonna skip that Just to
[SPEAKER_00]: be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Jeff I live where our longest day
is only 13 hours long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know where this is going Mmm,
which of your strains would you would do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay with those shorter days?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried that a lot of stuff will
sprout and almost immediately go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you are accurate And to be quite
honest with you a hundred percent honest
[SPEAKER_00]: and fucking not lie to you at all as a
seed breeder I'd like to tell you I got
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit that's gonna work perfectly for
you, but I do not I breed And we're
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with these words sativa and indica
and all that shit now I breed sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant thin-leaved drug type cultivators
Of ours that will flower very quickly in
[SPEAKER_00]: your conditions most of what I breed It
will go into flower and that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: something more indica like more broadleaf
more mellowed out kind of stuff My shit's
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna do that for you My stuff will
flower very very quickly to be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I sure would love to run Morning
dew and he said my favorite song shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to a fellow deadhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey now They said I'd love to run morning
dew orangegasm blue raspberry truffle or
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog, which is also a grateful
dead reference If you're paying attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll go with whichever one will grow
with more Equatorial type of light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I wish I could sell you some
seeds, bro But I don't want to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a reputation to keep I've got a
friend to keep I've got a patron to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: here I got a business to manage and I'm
more about keeping you guys as my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and being fucking honest with you That's
working really well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can lose out on a seed sale and tell you
that I probably don't have what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite honest You could buy some
stuff, but keep it indoors until it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower Like keep it indoors under grow
lights get it big and then when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to flip it then go put it outside
That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, bro, I don't have the
product for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even trying to be that guy But I
don't want to rip you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for Ferraris, bro And I
sell Volkswagen's which may be related
[SPEAKER_00]: some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a car guy That was a bad analogy,
but most of what I've got is gonna flower
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly outside It likes a lot of
light as soon as soon as you get out there
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably flip so my advice would be
to get something vegit indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of late for that now Then put it
out there when you're ready to flip it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it sounds like you could probably get
if you got I've never I've never said this
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, but you need autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run you don't need I would
recommend I would recommend three runs of
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers in a summer If your days are
that sure you could probably bust out
[SPEAKER_00]: three runs of autoflowers Just put them
out there and get them going You could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably do it at least two runs of autos
here you guys is a good situation where
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers come into play I talked A lot
of shit about autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are It's not that they're
inferior I'd rather be able to veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate my plants do their veg cycle
for a commercial production and get what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want and flower Them when I'm ready here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plants that are gonna flip on
their own anyway So let's just put
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers out there and maybe that's
what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an autoflower guy Maybe the short
flowering cycle, but you could pull more
[SPEAKER_00]: of them is what I'm thinking you get like
three cycles You can get two cycles of
[SPEAKER_00]: regular cannabis also out there probably
but honestly, dude this my Products aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be the best products for you Maybe
try the the flow of the prana the prana
[SPEAKER_00]: may be the one that would work out there
for you But I really don't want to lie to
[SPEAKER_00]: you rip you off take your money And then
you think those plants are gonna do well
[SPEAKER_00]: and they go into flower when you call me
and you're like cage redlock Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, straight-up honesty is the best
policy right here There is more if you
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to mention me or my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please mention Dt o m 420 is my username
On a lot of forums and IG so it's don't
[SPEAKER_00]: tread on me 420 don't tread on me Shout
out to our friend Dt o m 420 for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: question and then it says I oh I replied
with I think most of my stuff will flip
[SPEAKER_00]: early on you maybe try sun kiss or Prana,
so that was my recommendation my advice
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys I could have recommended
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually recommended autoflowers,
which is weird just because they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna flower early on you, but But you'll
be able to get more crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think If you just pull an autoflowers
and put them out there and they'll flip
[SPEAKER_00]: right away and you pull more I don't know
that may be terrible advice I'm not an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an autoflower guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing that maybe you could
pull more There's a reason why people do
[SPEAKER_00]: the autos outdoors I may have just talked
out of my ass on that one Take my advice
[SPEAKER_00]: with the grain of salt on that but I was
honest with you I don't have the product
[SPEAKER_00]: for you tried to find a solution you guys
I'm fucking high and rambly it is time to
