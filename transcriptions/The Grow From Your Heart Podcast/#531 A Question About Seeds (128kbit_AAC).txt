[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of banana
orange cookies, full spectrum extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big four gram jar on the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it is a blend of banana kush and
orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as banana orange
smoothie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that is perfectly
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a banana orange smoothie with a
hint of pepper at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is coming from the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the orange cookies in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That peppery, dark undertone at the end
comes from the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange banana smoothie is dominant,
and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the jar here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get this open, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the banana orange cookies from our
friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the container, it says that
the product does contain 69.37% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
in this episode, I'm going to read a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of the folks who support the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off by giving a giant shout
out to our friend Nurse Geek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant thank you shout out
to Growing Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a giant shout out from my
buddy Bobby C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
Learning and Burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Big Toe Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big fist bump and a thank you
to Ryan M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a big thank you shout out
for Sephirot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to send a special thank you to HD
Chop.

[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before we go much further,
I want to send a big thank you to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike spent some time learning how to work
some audio equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took some time setting some stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found some space, some quiet time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been recording shows here on
Zoom and they will be appearing on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also be in the Apple podcast and
Stitcher podcast feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mike did a great job on episode 530.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thanks to Mike for
the fucking great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: 530 was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you to everybody who listened
and for all of the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a great response to episode 530.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really seemed to like seeing Mike
on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys send him a lot more words of
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send him a lot more thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get him on a lot more shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you missed it, episode 530,
I did a full interview with White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned a lot about Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn some stuff about my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what else do we need to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also in the process, I like to give
you guys garden updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a quick garden update for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in the process of reversing a female
golden goat plant to create female pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will only contain female
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can make more feminized seeds from
the golden goat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course, I will be making more
feminized golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make more lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more orange gasm in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be a couple of new things
and a couple of things that have been made
[SPEAKER_00]: and were put out and were very sought
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not have enough to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I'm going to make a production
batch of a couple of very popular things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using the golden goat reversed
female to create the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned that I've got the lemon
Jeffrey coming up, the orange gasm coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the feminized golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst that mix, I am going to add a
strawberry fields plant so we can make
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the red pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also add a blueberry cookies
plant to make more of the blue pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those names were tentative stress
test names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those strains will not be marketed as the
blue pill nor the red pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have a different name when they
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the names in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not announced them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not made anything official.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do a lot of research and make
sure I didn't steal any names before I
[SPEAKER_00]: label a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got names for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be remade when they are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new names, the permanent names will be
announced and the packages will be
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, at seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working on reversing that goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been sprayed its first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally like to spray one time before
I go to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wait and put it into flower about
seven to 10 days after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets sprayed the day which it goes into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will get sprayed again every three
days until I see pollen sacs forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the strain, I may continue to
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs continuous sprays after it shows
pollen sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then around day, most plants will show me
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me pollen a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat is kind of stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me wait until about day 30,
day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have pollen production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after that, I will have the
females pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put them in there when I see that
the male plants are developing well on the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I time that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see, oh, this female is now making
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see those real male plants forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to put the girls in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that I time that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put the girls in there until you
know that reversal is actually reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that reversal will keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a minute to turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's going to make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then by the time you get those females in
there and get them flowering about 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: in, everything will work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about timing, but that's where I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have begun the process of reversing the
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has received its first spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not yet into the flower room,
but it is getting ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pollinate some elite cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we'll remake some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also a couple of things you guys
don't even probably know I've got in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: New stuff may be coming here in 2020 or
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already cranking through this year,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like this has been a long
February or a real long Tuesday or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that is what it's felt
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarantine is messing us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are going outside,
getting some exercise, doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off your sweatpants and put on your
jeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they still fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how many belt holes you've extended
your waist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're doing all right with your
health and with yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check in on somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't called your mama,
if you haven't called somebody cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check in on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not weird to call somebody and check
on them during quarantine time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough quarantine talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough plant update talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I talk about growing under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to be impressed by the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want to eat a little bit more,
but I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I'm getting more growth,
probably getting more production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are probably expanding quite
rapidly because I am feeding them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently started giving them dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give the seedlings and the brand new
clones get 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently given them, I've started
giving them three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give them four hours of
darkness here on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be probably the day that this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be clicked into four hours of
darkness and 20 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the clones in that room will be
flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the clones in that room are
intended to be mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get separated out of that room,
the light cycle will get changed again and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the plants will get arranged into
their final spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we determine sex, then we will
trellis them and there's some steps to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm impressed with the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am seeing amazing growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's as hot as the 600 watt
light that I replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the two 320 watt cannon LEDs in
place of a 600, a 600 HPS and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel as warm in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we're not to the middle of the
summer yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we will really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how hot it got then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll compare then, but that is my rambly
update on the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got LEDs going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in there look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Jack the Ripper seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've revealed that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got seedlings in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are Jack the Ripper from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from TGA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Jack the Rippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look fairly uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it topped itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew two main tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's interesting, but the other
four, they all look fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to pull off that extra side
branch that makes it have two tops,
[SPEAKER_00]: that other one would match the others very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite uniform, except for that one weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Jack the Rippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking love, love, love the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in three gallon pots, a soil-less
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been getting fed new millennium
and veg bloom and recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to love it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got for you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say we were going to read some
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two emails lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may pull out a third, depending on how
long this episode goes, depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: rambly I can continue to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in this episode comes from
our friend, Paparoni, and it goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your podcast for a
few months, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing comments and compliments
like that, and thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this all the time, but it's really
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys weren't listening,
if it were just me talking, this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make this a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just be a psychopath or something
if I just sat here and spoke into the mic
[SPEAKER_00]: and stared at myself like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, that'd just be fucking really
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I've got a good audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys are so supportive,
and I've been really loving and enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction that I've been getting
through social media, through email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just during this quarantine, we've all
been keeping each other company,
[SPEAKER_00]: so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This says, I am way overdue for finally
becoming a Patreon contributor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it just says from becoming a Patreon,
but I am here finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, don't worry about taking a long time
to join us on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't know it exists,
and you've got to put in a credit card
[SPEAKER_00]: number on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sketchy, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, not everybody's got a few bucks,
and I don't expect money from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, you can, and you can now,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anybody to feel bad for not
helping me out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of people do, so thank you to the
people who do, and if you don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that you can help me out is tell a
friend how cool the show is, or just do
[SPEAKER_00]: your best in the grow every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the grow, think what would
Ross de Jeff do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rules you should follow in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the Ross de Jeff method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any shit that can be done today,
do it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait till tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can do a little bit better,
do it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can clean up, fucking clean
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the best cannabis grower and cannabis
advocate and spokesperson you can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dipshit in public when you're
lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way you can help me out for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I told you I'm rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's blame it on our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the banana orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is delicious and potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, for now, you can refer to me as
Papa Roni on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rhymes with pepperoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just begins with a papa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: An old friend came up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to ask why we call one of
my friends Papa Roni, but big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend Papa Roni.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your name pop up in the Patreon
contribution feed several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for helping us out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I'm looking forward to
talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I upgrade my Patreon tier,
I'm sure you'll be able to pass on a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of grow wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a million for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signed again from Papa Roni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro, don't be afraid to ask me some
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've signed up for Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of the squad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of the gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got questions, we'll get them
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else out there, if you've got
questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I do get to those Patreon
questions a little bit more frequently and
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Patreon may be a way to get your
question moved up to the top of the ladder
[SPEAKER_00]: or have a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your question's interesting,
I will read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to help everybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a stack over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably 100 emails in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just may take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's refocus and put me back on the rails
here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going way fast today and I got a lot
of shit to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, I don't know if they
want their name said, but this one comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from a friend down there in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends in the 505
Albuquerque in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys aren't going too Albuquerque
during the quarantine, but the message
[SPEAKER_00]: goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, good morning, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning to you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I write you with a curious
problem about some product I was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently flowered five blue OG Kush,
allegedly from, we're not going to say who
[SPEAKER_00]: they came from, allegedly from this place
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend had many other seeds and strains
from various other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend happened upon the stash of
flower and seeds after the feds broke up
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you found some flowers and seeds from a
rate of grow in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were left unattended and
eventually seeded.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were they just, let's see, I want to
read more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friend, other seeds and strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to the stash of flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds broke up the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was stuff that was left
unattended.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a number of strains in the room
that seeded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to you is a number of these
female plants hermed out to create,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, if a number of these plants hermed out
to create seed throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, there were thousands of viable
seeds and they were labeled accordingly to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant they came out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue genetics allegedly tout stability,
but all phenos were wildly vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, are these seeds blue OG
bat cross or when they herm, does the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen get bad enough that I have a bunch
of crazy random crosses that now need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be stabilized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took your advice and I'm waiting a round
or two to start breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping some amazing fruity gas and
purple phenos alive until I can afford a
[SPEAKER_00]: small tent to either stress the female for
more BX seeds or to pop a male so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice or expert knowledge would be
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tell people this is OG
Kush, if it was really crossed with
[SPEAKER_00]: Candyland or some Clementine or Lucinda
Williams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still want to stabilize this strain
in the future and possibly start breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: once, since no one wants to take
initiative in Albuquerque to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, there are a couple of people doing
really wonderful breeding projects down
[SPEAKER_00]: there in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a little bit of research,
you can find them on social media very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends down there doing
breeding projects in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go down there and do some consulting for
some other crows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not involved in any of the breeding
projects down there, but I do know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on down there in the cannabis scene
in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting stuff happening right
now, especially with the quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to run out of herb if they
don't step it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are breeders in Albuquerque,
but still don't be afraid to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're going to try to find a
male out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't find a true male, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was a grow, a commercial
cultivation that was raided and taken
[SPEAKER_00]: down, I'm going to assume, and this is
just me making an ass of you and me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of the plants in this cultivation
were females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably did not want males around in
a commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they got raided, they're going after
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably weren't breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably a big setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a bunch of plants that seeded
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of ways that this
could have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess they hermed out or they
did a thing where when the plants go too
[SPEAKER_00]: long, they make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if those seeds are going
to produce hermaphroditic seeds or if
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds are a hermaphroditic progeny
with intersex traits or if they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're looking for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that's going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they came from female plants,
there will be no male genetics in that
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should not find any males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a male plant, it is actually a
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to express male parts,
but also it will have female parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was no male pollen in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, allegedly, I'm assuming so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a couple of good questions
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these blue OG bat cross or when they
herm, does the pollen get bad enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a bunch of crazy random crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where the pollen came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if that one of the plants
freaked out and hermed and made pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if two different strains in
that room freaked out and made pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if every room or every plant
in that room turned into a hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: and made pollen and pollinated that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen from plant A and B could have
landed on plant C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got seeds that are A,
B, and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to identify exactly
what you've got out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a bunch of crazy random crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you've got a bunch of crazy random
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is something in there that you
find weird, what you can do is grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is a personal breeding project,
you can grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put these to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not for anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This story is a cool story for you to tell
behind some seeds, but these seeds aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: for anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be mutants,
hermaphrodites, and question marks coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't ask for money for seeds with
question marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to know parents of parents of
parents and how they were bred and where
[SPEAKER_00]: they were bred if you're going to ask for
money for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like saying, hey, make me some
food and we'll open a food truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go to the fridge and I get seven
random ingredients and put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: blender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you fucking get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hope I got ice cream and peanut butter
and not like pickles and peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to know what's going into
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling because I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about ice cream,
but geez, let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what made those crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it hermed out, then you've got herm
genetics also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to carry on that herm trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow them out, see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're going to find a male in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not going to be a true male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress the female for more BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make hermaphrodites by
doing all of this stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find something that is a solid female that
has the traits you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really insist on working with these
to further generations, find a female that
[SPEAKER_00]: expresses full female traits that has all
of the other traits you like, aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, color, structure, whatever you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that in one of those plants from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then stress test the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in many different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it hermaphrodites on you in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's another trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I do with the plant before I
breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a stress test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on 12-12 for about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see bud sets forming,
you got nice fat pistols, you got
[SPEAKER_00]: dandelions going up the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck with the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it back on 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it for about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it freak out immediately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it act okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it not freak out at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put that timer back on 12-12 and give
it 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, four, five weeks in, maybe six weeks
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fuck with it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put the timer on 24 hours for two
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant may produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it produces seeds on its own,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it produces hermaphrodite signs,
if it shows you male flowers popping up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to get rid of that plant or do
not breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to breed with one that will not
hermaphrodite on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get very, very careful to not
have hermaphroditic intersex traits in
[SPEAKER_00]: your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify a solid female because you only
want a female out of this batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what I would do personally,
I would whip up a batch of silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate and I would reverse that
female and make pollen out of that female
[SPEAKER_00]: and put that pollen on a clone of the same
plant and make reversed seeds out of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did a good job by selecting one
that is not hermaphroditic, which it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be scarce in this batch because
that is a trait that is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants reproduced without a male in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was asexual reproduction that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There had to be pollen production somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't identify what did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got asexual reproduction in this
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hermaphroditism or intersex traits is
very common or very likely somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: this gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find a solid female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the female that is what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress test the shit out of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse her by using silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it with any of that silver silly
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of causing a hermaphrodite,
let's cause a chemical reaction in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say I'm crazy,
but we're doing it chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm doing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a trait that's just in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using some science behind my
understandings of doing this to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pollinate a clone of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've made S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got self seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find many phenotypes that look just
like the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just reverse and then you'll find some
phenotype that lean a little bit towards
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the pollen came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have more that lean a little
bit towards whatever the pollen receiver
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you could have Lucinda
Williams crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have Candyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have Blue OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have all kinds of random crosses
in this room, but I don't know what seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with because I don't know
which plant it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel like I really went on a good
ramble on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got random pollen in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which plants the pollen came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what caused the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to make money off this batch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did say that you're waiting before you
start doing some breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advice and expert knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't take money for these because
you'll make people mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ruin your reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then don't share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do share them, make sure you only
share them with people you know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell them this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a good one.
