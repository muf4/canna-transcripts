episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will come out actually on
421.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everybody had a safe and joyous
and successful 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like in the social area,
the news, the things we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, they have lifted the mask bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's wearing a mask anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere we go, the masks are over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the pandemic has ended right
on time for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everybody's out smoking
again, taking bong rips together,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking dads together, smoking joints
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when it happened,
but it seemed like one day everybody just
[SPEAKER_00]: gave up that old Pandy thing was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was back to 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we all got comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lifted a lot of the mask mandates
right on time for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a time to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a safe and joyous
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you back to smoking with people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you comfortable?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been smoking with strangers per
se, but I've definitely been dabbing and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast or send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know where you are this 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you smoking with people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you taking dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you passing blunts?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you handle your health this year
for 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of people are smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no masks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's segue into talking about
something that did change for 420 this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in Denver, we have a 420 freedom
rally where people gather in Civic Center
[SPEAKER_00]: Park and they openly consume cannabis is
sort of a open.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A friendly, peaceful protest and a display
of we want to smoke cannabis openly and be
[SPEAKER_00]: peaceful and be civil people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every year at 420 in Denver,
April 20th, of course we would do that in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, Colorado at Civic Center Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get is it Civic Center Parks at
the Capitol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong with the words I'm saying
with the location, but we all knew where
[SPEAKER_00]: it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one big spot where everybody was
right at the capitals at Capitol Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, somebody correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the right location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew where to drive and word of parking
out of walk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, the point is we would all gather
there often and smoke freely for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be thousands of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be booths there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be people giving out water,
vending drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would give away cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good friendly, open environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would always be a drum circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunch of people smoking weed, hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be bands over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it get a little bit more
organized and a little more corporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the word they actually built a fence
around one part and built a concert inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fenced area and charge people money
to get into the concert, which I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was weird because that fence didn't stop
the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could still hear all of the musicians
playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to get down there into the
concert area, you did have to pay some
[SPEAKER_00]: money to get into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there have been some changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, the 420 rally has been turned
into the Denver 420 Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 420 Freedom Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: They built a cage around the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put up fences around the entire
venue, around the entire event where we
[SPEAKER_00]: would normally congregate freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were charging a ticket price to
get into that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also put out a notice saying no
cannabis consumption would be tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some cannabis was consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the police were outnumbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outdone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stop all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were saying they were not going
to allow permit or endorse any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumption, trading,
giving away, vending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all going to be shut down and
people would be arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also did mention that there would be,
I read in one article said five,
[SPEAKER_00]: another article said seven beer tents
available, sponsored by local beer
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've really taken a huge turn with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to go smoke cannabis in the park
for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to pay money to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot smoke cannabis, but we can buy
beer at the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a big turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is partially because of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is mostly because of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they have changed the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten so over-consumed,
over-populated with people coming to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: on 420 inundated is the word my brain was
fishing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've had to change things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention in your area, in your
jurisdiction, your locale.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are making rules, writing
proposals for legalization of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the kinds of things that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to have recreational and legal
cannabis here, but I wish we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: done several things differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we would have had places where we
can consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had legal cannabis here for,
I'm going to say fucking over 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 14ish years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had legal cannabis here,
either medical or recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 14 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to remember off the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had legal cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not been a safe place until
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have not been safe places for people
to go and smoke the cannabis, which they
[SPEAKER_00]: can legally acquire here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are making the rules in your
area, make sure to include places that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a social lounge, if it's a,
a medicating lounge, something where
[SPEAKER_00]: people can get out of their car and go
smoke inside somewhere safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, most of the legal States,
you got to go smoke in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go smoke somewhere shady and
that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have the Canada cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have a few places, but
legalization shut that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the rules and laws were made to
put those places out of business and
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do make those rules,
try to include somewhere to consume the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in your legalization,
your legislation, your regular regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: and your proposals for all of your goods,
because we want you to be able to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis, which we are legalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also, you want to be able to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can grow cannabis in your
legalization proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want home grows to be legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would make sure to have
in there is some sort of legal events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to have events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, I don't know what the feeling
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels, it feels shitty to be honest
that I can pay money to get into this
[SPEAKER_00]: concert, to go see these bands that are
playing and hang out with my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't smoke a joint, but everybody
around, I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, uh, I choose not to drink alcohol
because I cannot behave responsibly once I
[SPEAKER_00]: do drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't consumed alcohol since I got my
very first medical cannabis card in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't had alcohol since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy and consume all the ganja that I
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fixes 90% of my problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol causes me problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink it, but everybody around me
is drinking beer, getting hammered,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting shit faced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them drink responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them drink excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the full range, but I'm seeing
lots of different types of behavior stem
[SPEAKER_00]: from the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't reach in my pocket and smoke a
bowl without checking every direction and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there's a cop or security guard
around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'll go to jail for getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know I'm not going to make the
argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to leave, try to, try to chill out
an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drunk guy gets in a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stone guy wants nachos, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to go there, but
legalization put us in this position where
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only go in there and consume
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the alcohol, which I can
afford, which is probably like 12 bucks a
[SPEAKER_00]: cup or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I can't smoke any weed and the
four 20 festival kind of bullshit is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do write these rules,
propose these rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're one of the people that is,
uh, advocating fighting for cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area, make sure you include somewhere
to consume the cannabis and also make some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of provisions, regulations,
rules, amendments, uh, to where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: have some sort of parties, gatherings,
festivals, where we can legally consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done here in Colorado is it
makes it really hard for the illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: establishments to participate in any of
the events because they have to illegally
[SPEAKER_00]: bring product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to illegally display it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a big shit show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the events now are kind of
smaller than they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're low key.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit more private.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't advertise like we would like to,
because that will set us up to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be very secretive until the day
of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be like, it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it limits the opportunity for us
to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, to recap on all that make rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can consume the cannabis
somewhere, some sort of cannabis lounge,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dab lounge, the smoke lounge,
the church of ganja, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it, make sure there's somewhere in
your community area jurisdiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you reside over for your
legalization amendments and movements to
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can smoke some cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure everybody can grow the
cannabis they need to supply for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also try to make some sort of rules
to where we can have freedom with our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis festivals, gatherings,
festivals, events, parties to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that we're giving our money to,
every week, every month at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: can throw parties and have us back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they can throw on a concert and get
snoop and whiz, and they can actually put
[SPEAKER_00]: products out for us and let us go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I should be able to buy, if when I get
in line to get my nachos, I should also be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get a couple of joints or get a
dab or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the other line is getting a
mixed drink, a fucking margarita,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hard lemonade or a $12 beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I just buy a joint from the guy
at the counter right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not going to be a real good
pre-roll, but it's better than not being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think we should be able to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe some edibles, maybe sell me 25
milligram edibles at the concert so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of edibles, I'm going to do a
Patreon only episode where I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned and look forward to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I've been smoking some,
uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the garlic banger, alive rosin from
green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be one of my favorite
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say it was rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gets me high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you get consumption
rules, homegrown rules, event rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the rules are what you want
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we kind of pushed a lot of great
shit out of the industry when we made a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was SB 1280.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they really messed up a lot of things
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have seen it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have had more people on our
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have voted against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have made more awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't even see it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't even know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention for things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are responsible for the
legalization movements in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've rambled on for several
minutes about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say this was going to be a quick
show to test the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of more topics I'd like
to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be some discord server
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you have felt uncomfortable
on the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've had problems logging in,
if you've been booted from the server
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally or on purpose, there have
been some changes in the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you may have to find the new discord
servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two servers, the irie genetics,
irie army community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what we titled the new server
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also Rasta Jeff's secret
stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best to find both of those
servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we'll all be there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know when you're on the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the old one will be phased out very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new one will be updated and totally
correct, uh, moderated, um, managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be there more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, I wasn't on the disc with the
older discord enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things got away from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to regroup rebuild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be back better and stronger than
ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the new discord will be popping
up probably right around the same time as
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we timed it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should mention,
um, where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on Patreon content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just mentioned that I was going
to do a Patreon episode where I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to try to record that if all
things go well, I do have a guest invited
[SPEAKER_00]: to come over here in a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll record that, try to get that up to
you, uh, this month on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it will be up early, early next
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do promise that episode is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on if my partner in crime can
make it over here to eat edibles with me
[SPEAKER_00]: on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should talk about is I'm
slowly restocking all the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I am also the sole proprietor,
the head breeder, the H M F C of I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are messaging me and
asking me where are the seed restocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is just me mainly packing up beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly they get to the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the vendors do have to take time to
check them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to inventory count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then they've got to add them to the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are able to purchase them,
but keep in mind that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people trying to buy seeds and a lot of
these companies are smaller than they do
[SPEAKER_00]: appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 90% of the company is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few helping hands
occasionally, uh, some small packing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys know that Clint's helping out
and there's some stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, but most of it is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm overloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best to get the seeds to the
vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they've got to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've probably got one person that
works for them that is receiving seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from multiple breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to count all the packs in
inventory, them put them on the website,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure everything is legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a business in the backend that
we may not see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be patient with the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I'm restocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I said that you guys went crazy,
started, uh, harassing messaging the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your ravenous hounds, give them a
couple of minutes to get the products
[SPEAKER_00]: checked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put them on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't withhold product on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're in business to do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do any business by withholding
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not how commerce would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do want to get them out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give us time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that some of the companies
are not as big as they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a large presence, but there are
small numbers of manpower and women power
[SPEAKER_00]: and non-binary power in a lot of these
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to say a lot of weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to edit this part out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more very important order of
business to cover before we start wrapping
[SPEAKER_00]: up this episode of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big hug, a big fist bump,
uh, just a sincere, uh, love you bro to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, grass tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to advertise grass testers
business, but he's having a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I want him to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you, bro.
