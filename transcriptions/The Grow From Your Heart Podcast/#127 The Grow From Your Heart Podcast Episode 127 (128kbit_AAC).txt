education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_04]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_04]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I need to give a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: That music was kind of loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting down over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I want to thank my guests for joining

[SPEAKER_04]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: White Mike, how you doing buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a fucked up on kombucha and Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all fired up and ready to do a good
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm fired up too.
[SPEAKER_04]: This should be a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a bunch of doctor or Mountain Dew
in front of you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be fired up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fired up, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right in front of me is my new... Why did
I say new?
[SPEAKER_04]: My old buddy, Gary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you represent any organization or are
you just here out of Gary's kindness?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a concerned citizen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Concerned citizen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get started in the podcast,
I do have a few things I want to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when I said bad shit happens in
threes?
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost three friends in the month of
March.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a huge shout out to my good
friend, John Gerlach.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Gerlach was a local Pueblo musician.
[SPEAKER_04]: He played in a band known as Lizard Run.
[SPEAKER_04]: He played in all the open mics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He played with a bunch of the most popular
musicians in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a really inspiring drummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a guitar player.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a vocalist.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a songwriter.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wrote a couple of my favorite songs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wrote a song called Fuck Buddy that
always makes me giggle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody at the table smiled when they
heard it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who couldn't smile at a song called Fuck
Buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: John was an amazing musician.
[SPEAKER_04]: They called him girly.
[SPEAKER_04]: A big shout out to girly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you, miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully that's the last rest in peace we
have to do on the podcast for quite a
[SPEAKER_04]: while.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the third one in March.
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Gerlach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I have an email from a friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about dosage on the podcast of
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, I recommended too much because
this guy said that his girlfriend was
[SPEAKER_04]: nearly tripping from the dosage that I
recommended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember what you recommended?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're supposed to recommend
five or 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I said 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I said 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hear a lot of people recommends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell people, oh, you've been smoking
flour for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start with 10 or 20 or 30 or
40.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work your way up slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes in a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's why.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I apologize to you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got all wrecked because you ate too
much Edibles because of me, I owe you an
[SPEAKER_04]: apology and email me if that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll let you come punch me in the
balls or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make it up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles hit some people where you really
want to start slow and keep your dose low
[SPEAKER_02]: for until you step it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know how hard it's going to
hit you, how long it's going to take to
[SPEAKER_02]: hit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Edibles will wreck you if you're
not ready for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come feed me too many Edibles if
you overdose yourself because of my
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize if I misguided somebody and
made them eat too much THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: The correct dosage, if you're going to
consume Edibles and it's your first time
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're a noob, you should probably
stick with 10 milligrams to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait about an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't feel anything, wait another
hour and eat 10 more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think we should tell them to
eat, wait an hour and eat more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat 10, wait two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: After two hours, it will have had time for
your stomach to break it down,
[SPEAKER_02]: process it through your liver and get it
into your blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't eat more before that first window is
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that window hits and you never felt
anything, go ahead and step your dose up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something should have kicked or it
kicked in, you just might not have
noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say something I want to
mention is oftentimes I'll eat some
[SPEAKER_04]: Edibles as I'm getting ready to go
somewhere and I'll be like, these Edibles
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't even working.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get wherever you're going and
you're like, oh man, Edibles are working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes you got to get out of the
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to just go to the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also I feel like when I'm here,
this is my comfort zone right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the computer in front of me,
the mixing board to one side.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the email right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got another rig right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything goes too wrong right here,
there's a couch right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just lay down on like within 10
feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am cool right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like I get as high here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could smoke a gram a hash right here and
be okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I smoked the same gram at your
house, I would be three times as high and
[SPEAKER_04]: a little uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just something about environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for episode 100, I think I ate 50
milligrams while we were sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day, 20 just wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was super high having a blast and
it took me a minute to realize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was just those two 10 milligram
gummies that did this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a 100 milligram Mark Kawa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a little liquid drink that they
sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have 100 milligram one of those in my
fridge right now that I'm tempted to go
[SPEAKER_04]: grab and consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, stick with the correct dosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't get too wrecked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go outside, go for a walk or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take a break from your normal routine
and see if it's kicked in yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if it hasn't, then eat a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and just if you find yourself in
over your head, just remember that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't hurt yourself with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can scare yourself real good,
but you're not going to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not dying.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're freaking out, I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just really funny right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things seem weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat something, lay down, drink some
caffeine if you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll always help you come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dairy products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dairy products are the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do a lot of dairy products,
but yeah, in case you might happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ice cream is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help tone it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some food in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a bad edibles experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: About my third edible that I consumed was
a Dixie Lixers, 75 milligram soda.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those come on strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really way too heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had like about a four hour panic
attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this is, you know, being a daily
smoker for over 15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point I'd been dabbing daily
for about three or four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was not a novice in any way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, plenty of THC, plenty of experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, edibles are really strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like when I first started doing
edibles, sometimes in those, like say the
[SPEAKER_03]: first five attempts, it would take like
six to eight hours to kick in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're a bigger dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, slow metabolism.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really varies depending on the
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hit me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can almost swallow a damn edible and
feel it coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's more than 30 minutes, it's
bullshit and I'm taking it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm raising hell at somebody because I
mean, they come on right away now and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: about at a hundred milligrams is where I
need to be for a dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's very effective for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I take that to go to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I use edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a, you know, an edible at night to
go to bed helps with my pain about how,
[SPEAKER_04]: how long before bedtime do you consume an
hour?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would recommend also.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on the same page here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a recent news story up out of
Denver that, uh, the people going to the
[SPEAKER_02]: ER for marijuana related reasons are
predominantly from out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why they go to the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't listen to the bud tender.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eat the whole incredible bar and they
end up fried and they don't have anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go, Oh, calm down, honey here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have some hog and dyes and a bottle of
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they ended up in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just go slow people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you're that high, it's hard to
convince yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not that high, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you're, you're on drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm on drugs, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm freaking out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't know what to do anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you know, when I lived in Texas
because of price constraints, I was about
[SPEAKER_03]: a gram a day smoker.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And flowers are hash flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only flowers.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, cause that's all you could get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded like it went off when you
touched it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really odd touching that, that plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was just more of a cost thing,
you know, cause it's fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to, you know, you have to
budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was, you know, I'd spoke about a gram
of flowers a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I could get concentrates,
I would get them, but they were few and
[SPEAKER_03]: far between.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just paying like 60 bucks an eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't, isn't it like a grandma concentrate
of felony in Texas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this table right here, we could all go
to prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we would be, dude, they can just shoot
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't play with concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look, look at what they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were afraid for our lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to turn into weed zombies
and it's all damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but you know, yeah, you know,
the quality also varied a lot with that
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, it was the illegal state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, you know, the levels of THC I had
my body then were not what they are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're coming from out of state
here, especially from a state where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: still illegal, you're not a medical user.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Edibles are a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell a 350 milligram edible and it's
a tiny little thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's a little dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, that can be dangerous for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate that on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I didn't have this chair,
I might have flown away like this chair
[SPEAKER_04]: and computer and table are all that kept
me on this planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just people got to realize that it's
edibles are a different kind of high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's real easy to notice you've
had enough and stop hitting the joint as
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes around the circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you can't uneat drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that a lot at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, once you decide that you're going to
eat it, you're on that roller coaster
[SPEAKER_02]: until it comes to a complete stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's no eject button in the middle
and you just have to ride it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, unfortunately you really can't like
you're going to wake up tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as long as you don't, don't call your
mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't call your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't call the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't call the paramedics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely don't call the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know that you ate too many
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call Domino's get a pizza on family guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some almond butter for Joe Buzzi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put on the Simpsons.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's for Buzzi.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Simpsons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buzzi Buzzi is a Simpsons from almond
brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have corrected that issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep saying that, but I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody did wreck themselves,
I'm an asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not cool to do to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them to take too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do sincerely feel bad if I wreck
somebody's life, day, weekend,
[SPEAKER_04]: evening, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start real low folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, what's the most you've ever eaten?
[SPEAKER_04]: The most edibles, milligrams you've ever
eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me back up one question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your daily dose of edibles?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you like to eat the, uh,
the little 50 milligram, uh, was that the-
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're, they're super soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, it's a Synergy five and five,
five milligram THC five milligram CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, product in morning and night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, I augment that with,
I've been doing a lot of green hornets
[SPEAKER_02]: lately from Chiba Chu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a great product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Chiba Chu's non-paid
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, uh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, uh, they're a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're worth advertising for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a fan since they were just
medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, I sell them all day now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take a bottle home every couple of
days just to enjoy randomly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So w w for a medical dose, how much THC do
you like to consume?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if it's, if it's just like,
I just take it as a preventative against
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation in my knees and neck right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm around 10 to 20 milligrams CBD and
THC a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then like, if my back's messed up
or really hurting or I'm going crazy and
[SPEAKER_02]: my knees are pissed, I'll up it to 35,
40, 50 of each edibles per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have like a recreational,
like if you're going to take a
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational dose, how much do you like to
like to take there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anywhere between like 20 and 35 or 40
milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what's the most you've ever eaten was
going to be my big question on 250 or 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just what I know from the rec
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like God only knows what used to go into
these muffins.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember back in the day when Karen or
Karen's banana bread, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, so we have a friend who was a grown
ass man who ate one of those and fell down
[SPEAKER_04]: some stairs and knocked me down the bottom
portion of those stairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he was too high to function.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was too high to save myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once he hit me, he fell down and I took me
to like a bowling pin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just went down the style and there's only
a couple of stairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun, but this grown man just and
giggled like a child because this banana
[SPEAKER_04]: bread was just killing us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was wrecking us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those days were amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't edibles like that available
in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think God only knows how strong
that was because nothing was figured out
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as it is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make my own sometimes and I made some
butter today actually out of a,
[SPEAKER_03]: well I made, what I did was I had,
I bought ounces of wax, about five of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so I had all these papers that
still had a lot of residual on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put them in a slow cooker with
coconut oil and just soaked all that off
[SPEAKER_03]: of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I put, you know, a big plop of
wax in there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just let it, you know, simmer a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's in the freezer and,
um, you know, I'll use that for making
[SPEAKER_03]: some edibles.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, but there's no way to tell
how much is in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got to taste it and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make them small.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you, Gary was saying, uh, you like to
take a hundred milligrams about an hour
[SPEAKER_04]: before bedtime to help you sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you, uh, do, do you increase that if
you want to get recreational?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I decrease it to get recreation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about a 50 milligrams dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the hundred makes you sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want to overdo it because
then you're going to have to take 200 to
[SPEAKER_04]: sleep every night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's, it's a little too much,
you know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So half of that, about a 50, sometimes
about a 75 makes you a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I get those, uh, peanut butter Buddha
bars from, yeah, they've been getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the monkey bar guys, if you're
going to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are a 35 milligram sections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two of those is 70.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good dose for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: For, you know, to function and have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to eat the whole hundred milligram
monkey bar or the 350 milligram,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, peanut butter bar from, uh,
mountain medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 50 used to be my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like eight, nine months ago, 50 was my
sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I mean, just recently there was a,
like 20 milligrams I had, it was an empty
[SPEAKER_02]: stomach day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I kind of popped them without thinking
while I was doing chores around the house
[SPEAKER_02]: and I caught myself doing laundry,
like super into folding the towels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a huge shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Maddie made pot tarts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, she made medicated jelly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The jelly straight up had hash oil in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she made like doughy crust,
like pop tart crust that was medicated as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she made frosting that was a
medicated as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she gave me a good size portion for my
birthday and I ate it and I tried to drive
[SPEAKER_04]: to work and it kicked in about three
quarters of the way to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what just happened?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I was like, something just weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, did my car just break down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, did I just get a flat tire?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the wind just kick in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the earth just die?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause suddenly everything was just like,
that was weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Maddie wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many milligrams were in
that edible, but shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing was fucking tremendous,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a hard day at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything got done at half speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some of the strongest wax I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, uh, the guy who made it had a
outdoor grill and he let it cure and it
[SPEAKER_03]: was beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had this great smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was, the trim was all cured when
he blew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kicking myself for not bringing some
for you to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I made the coconut oil
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's some of the strongest I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like the best I've ever
had, but it's the strongest.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the, uh, what's the biggest dose of
edibles you've ever taken?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the 350 mountain medicine bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit one of the, I think it was episode
36 or it was one of the earlier ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, it was a funny show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to mountain medicine too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really cost effective,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're affordable and affordable and,
uh, they, they deliver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody say something important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the, we actually had a purpose
behind this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a topic at hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just fun ramblings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got a couple of comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two more things I have to cover and
then I'll unleash you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: On that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me, uh, since I took that dab,
shout out to, uh, higher elevated,
[SPEAKER_04]: let me, I took a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bear with my brain, higher elevation,
masterpiece productions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the name of the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also elevate glass gallery in Colorado
Springs, uh, higher elevation masterpiece
[SPEAKER_04]: production can repair your broken rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will fix your broken glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will hook you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in Colorado Springs, search for
them on the internet or call them
[SPEAKER_04]: 719-646-5352.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can fix your broken rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool ass people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that is higher elevation, masterpiece
productions and their sister store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you call it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's her sister store,
their homie store, their partner store.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other store down the way is elevate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that one is on five 17 south Tejon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, both are really cool shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The customer service is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a great selection of
affordable rigs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got brand name rigs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got hitman rigs in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got denails in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got highly educated titanium
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, they've got a product in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe I didn't buy while I was
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they've got the highly educated nail
with the ceramic or not ceramic with the
[SPEAKER_04]: quartz dish on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got the titanium base with the
quartz dish on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much indestructible.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take care of it, uh, go get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bad ass piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, shout out to those places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I support them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also one more big, uh, important message.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been advertising the secret session
on four 20, uh, change of plans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Secret session is now on four 21 because
of some logistics in the city of Denver
[SPEAKER_04]: and things that go on when you're trying
to plan a cannabis event and people try to
[SPEAKER_04]: be fucked hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But secret session on four 21,
make sure you support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, email me for more information or
follow, I think it's secret session,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all of the advertising and
butt kissing I've got to do for the start
[SPEAKER_04]: of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we can get into the topics that
I've invited these young men here for,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, it's like a steel cage match.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just looked at both these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was about to ask him if they're
ready to fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the reason that, uh, these guys wanted
to get to get, they actually both messaged
[SPEAKER_04]: me wanting to do a podcast on this topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I love the initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, our local anti cannabis, um,
groups, is it one group or were there
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple groups involved in this bullshit?
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a second group now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could just be the first group using a
new name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well then let's not name either one of
their one or more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way they don't get any more
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, unless our people want to go troll
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to mention them so that maybe
perhaps people, and I, I couldn't ask our
[SPEAKER_04]: listeners to go and troll these people and
say crazy shit on their page, but if they
[SPEAKER_04]: did, I couldn't stop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or better yet, just go correct their
nonsense politely and watch them stew and
[SPEAKER_02]: freak out on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it makes them look even worse and
they can't figure out what to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any research at all,
but I think we'll just give them an easy
[SPEAKER_02]: way to find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to your page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just come to my page.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go check out Mike's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: I clicked like, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to follow the updates of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is a very, um, I don't know the word,
but he knows what the fuck is going on in
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis world and our local and our
state, uh, nationwide worldwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike stays up on top of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I need some updates on
cannabis, I go to Mike all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's my politics and cannabis update guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot going on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm insanely busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that mind busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about, uh, this local group
here is trying to close all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing just record?
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to do medical?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they want it all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you, um, head over to their page at
all and look through their post history,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, medical is a sham.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all a joke and a scam and a con to
make money, um, on the backs of our
[SPEAKER_02]: children and they want it all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now they're just focused on
getting rid of the rec industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So recreational stores, production
facilities, manufacturers, grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: testing labs, all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because because it's bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, that's the only reason I could find on
their Facebook page because drugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one article that kind of got into a
little bit of their reasons, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't like that there are more
homeless people in the city than there
[SPEAKER_02]: were before.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to think the crime problem in
the city is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and somehow cannabis shops in the
county related and, um, they, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's another one, the tax that the tax
proceeds that come in are really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really well reported.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they, they're pretty sure that if
they get rid of the taxes, then no one in
[SPEAKER_02]: government will have a reason to continue
to support the marijuana industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll be able to get rid of the rest of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of their issues are with home
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they're not going to get rid of
any home grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they get rid of the stores,
they're going to produce significantly
[SPEAKER_02]: more of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll cater to the black market all
over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Gary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we should talk about home grows
because there's been a big push on home
[SPEAKER_03]: grows lately, everywhere, multiple raids
in Denver down here, park County,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Montrose, um, 17 raids since March 1st
and I'm aware of there in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the state, um, major, major groups,
the bigger, or if you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_02]: major production out of your house and
you're not an incredibly well-known
[SPEAKER_02]: medical patient, um, and caregiver that's
registered in active in their local
[SPEAKER_02]: politics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'd have your paperwork in order and
have your plant count in order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check your local and county ordinances
because a lot of the cities and counties
[SPEAKER_04]: are passing limiting plant, limiting plant
counts while you're asleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it in private sessions while
you're sleeping, waking up to a no,
[SPEAKER_04]: a new plant count.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just out in your backyard,
cutting down your plants because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: out of compliance overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, uh, most of it around Colorado's
complaint driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there were a couple of well publicized
busts down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of them was because the neighbor
complained about some shit that most
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors would have complained about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the other one, they got
busted in Florida with a car full of weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas or Texas or wherever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got tracked back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, fuckers, but the interesting part
about both of those is that it was people
[SPEAKER_02]: from far away trying to grow weed here and
take it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and also they were like,
like the guy, the, the biggest,
[SPEAKER_03]: the biggest bust was five grow houses in
Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody involved, 12 people had all
been in Colorado less than 60 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're people that they, that's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know any part of the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they think they can do whatever they
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even know what to hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not even well informed enough to
know to hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not, it's just really sloppy and
stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes the rest of us look bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's my point there and you
know, there's, there is an effort right
[SPEAKER_03]: now, um, from the regulatory bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing it, you know,
like Mike was pointing out earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulations change abruptly
frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you have to really stay on
top and, uh, it's, it's almost like
[SPEAKER_03]: they're attempting to trip people,
license holders up so that they can find
[SPEAKER_03]: them or pull their license now that they
have their funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those massive license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really say that, but it's a lot
of the rules aren't passed with how
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll be implemented in exactly at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when they're writing the law,
they pick an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to pass today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give them six months from the today
to get it, to get into compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they're talking about like
major construction issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys dealing with the new
packaging rules at the spot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, everybody is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so stupid, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one of those things that just
recently happened in the MED tracking
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you buy loose flower,
I've got to give you a small pamphlet full
[SPEAKER_02]: of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so many printed labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the package, how everything's a
separate package and a batch number at the
[SPEAKER_04]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, the tracking is nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you think you can move here from,
from another state, grow weed here easily
[SPEAKER_02]: and then ship it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And B the neighbors are like, we,
your local paper hasn't reported on the
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of hours in city council meetings
that people have spent arguing zoning
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't seen the hundreds of news
articles about them every day in your
[SPEAKER_02]: local paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you just get the major news bulletins
and the, so the rest of us know,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, you can't have 600 plants in your
backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy's probably breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's going to call the cops on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, don't go over there for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I understand that this movement,
to make Pueblo West a city is related
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow to the anti cannabis stuff that if
they can get incorporated as a city,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can get rid of it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They then put you under municipal rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not under the county rule anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, I think that's their plan B is
what I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple of possible plan B's.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people, if, if the cannabis
business were shut down, if I said right
[SPEAKER_04]: now, no more cannabis business in Pueblo
West, no more recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: how many jobs would be lost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, immediately it would be somewhere
between 700 and a thousand people that's
[SPEAKER_02]: badged employees working at stores,
grows, production facilities, edible
[SPEAKER_02]: companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's going to be lawyers,
accountants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The accountants, the lawyers, um,
consultants, like Gary over here,
[SPEAKER_02]: the security companies, the contractors,
the grow store is going to start losing
[SPEAKER_02]: money for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they might do better because of more
home groves are going to spring up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's obvious, you know,
it's going to take a lot of hard grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, yeah, the volume that
those places do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be, yeah, it's what's going
to be, it's going to throw a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: in disarray.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be good for anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it takes more than two vehicles to
load up our soil order when we go buy soil
[SPEAKER_02]: at the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Pueblo can't take a hit like that
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for a thousand people to be out of
work overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the demographic that is employed in
most of these facilities are very 25 to 35
[SPEAKER_04]: to 40 year old folks right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're used to living off those budtender
tips and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going back to the bank,
you know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they lose this job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we had somebody trying to do
that recently, a friend of ours who lost
[SPEAKER_04]: his job or decided to not be involved in
the cannabis industry, tried to go get a
[SPEAKER_04]: job at a bank and he has to try to figure
out how to make that adjustment,
[SPEAKER_02]: make it look good on a resume and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the hit that Pueblo would take just
with those jobs is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you consider that secondary
supporting ring, I mean, there's a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: other industries that you need to run a
dispensary in the tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the article on my computer
screen, but I should mention the part
[SPEAKER_04]: about the, uh, the scholarships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's five million dollars out of the
county budget next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If like that's what they're projected to
make this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, uh, in November elections,
if this passes, um, next year we might
[SPEAKER_02]: collect three and a half million,
um, before October when this rule would
[SPEAKER_02]: kick in, but then that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so there's $5 million for the
stuff in the county budget we've slated to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with this money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 1.3 million of it's going to the
state fair to fix up, um, the ag building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's another 700,000 going for
college scholarships here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So local high school kids, um,
that are getting ready to graduate right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to go to one of the two
colleges down here in Pueblo, they can
[SPEAKER_02]: apply for a marijuana scholarship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and all of that money is coming from
marijuana taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're sending kids to college with this
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag marijuana scholarship.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I've got to say about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some middle school out in Pueblo
West where it's just like the road,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no sidewalk or gutter or anything
that the kids walk on from their
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood to the school every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like crazy unsafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause the buses that kids from a
little further out or riding on or
[SPEAKER_02]: traveling on the street too, they're
putting sidewalks in there with this
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're doing shit that should have
been done forever ago that we couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: afford to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we're going to stop $5 million
worth of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just overnight, uh, maybe after this
November's election, it's crazy to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of people fired up in
Pueblo right now over this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, it would be ridiculous to put that
many tax dollars in the, in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And flush it down and put that many people
out of employment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for something that's not causing
any problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Particularly when you think about,
you know, marijuana was here before it was
[SPEAKER_03]: legal and it's going to be here after
it's, you know, even if they pass this,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, all the benefits are going away
and the problems are going to compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: The growers that lose their jobs at the
dispensaries are going to go grow the
[SPEAKER_04]: black market, grow the shit out of it,
not pay taxes on it, have people come in
[SPEAKER_04]: and go into their residents, create more
traffic in your residence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have an illegal grow next door to your
house, have people come in to buy herb
[SPEAKER_02]: next door to your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what caught me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really bizarre about this,
this effort to shut down the rec industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is that's where the benefits come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they're almost problem free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in the entire run that Pueblo has done
with marijuana shops period, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: all one license was rescinded kind of
automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another license was the first
dispensary in Colorado period to get shut
[SPEAKER_02]: down for regulatory infractions,
not law violations or major rule breaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, the regulations change.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't meet them fast enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's been it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't cause crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have stuff going out the back
door to some other place or state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have teenagers shopping there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody down here in the legal
industry follows the rules because we all
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be open next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in any small violation of the rules
can cost you your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you don't see big dispensaries
screwing up in any major ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because it's too expensive to risk
screwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you end up hiring three or four
people to just run around all day and make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure everybody's complying with the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the most of the problems these people
have with legal marijuana have to do with,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, every other part of marijuana being
legal home grows where people can consume,
[SPEAKER_02]: how people can consume, um, the variety of
edible products, access to teenagers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like none of that shit changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get rid of rec, it all gets worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every bit of it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the county shops are doing like 1.7
to 2.5 million in sales every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You figure half that's tourists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've still got a million and a half
going back into the ghetto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't want all of that business
taking place in the house at the street
[SPEAKER_02]: because those are the ones that,
uh, bad people with shotgun show up and
[SPEAKER_02]: try to rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hotels are going to lose money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Restaurants are going to lose money.
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie theater will lose money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, that's the other half of that
money is all the people coming here for
[SPEAKER_02]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we were a spring break destination.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one I know that grew up here has ever
had like a bunch of people in town for
[SPEAKER_02]: spring break.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people came to town for spring
break this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the thing is if they would turn a
little different and promote that and
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivate that, then that could be huge
next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And massive amount of tax dollars,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Massive amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me, what do they make a year out
there in Pueblo West and cannabis taxes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, last year it was like 1.7 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: This next year it's going to be five
mainly because there's a new 3.5% tax on
[SPEAKER_02]: the production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an excise tax is $5 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and they put in massive growth
facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a huge expansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, the, we did we didn't have a
special excise tax, just a special sales
[SPEAKER_02]: tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know by any random chance what
Pueblo West's other tax income is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what do they bring in other than,
what's the number?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know their number minus cannabis
taxes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, the marijuana taxes represent
like 2% at most of the county or the state
budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is significantly more than alcohol
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, already when you put it as an overall
percentage, it seems small, but when you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the list of stuff that like,
we can't pay cops right now, like there
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't an extra 1% budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you got 5 million extra,
you can maybe, and it's not so much extra
[SPEAKER_02]: at this point because right now it's the
darkest fucking city I've ever driven
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: They budgeted for it because it's going to
come in this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so funding got moved around and
when the 5 million for marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if that doesn't come in because of
this vote, um, all kinds of stuff isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the year after that, because of
those cuts, they'll start to look like
[SPEAKER_04]: Detroit in a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, you really can't, Pueblo
definitely can't afford to lose that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you see major articles in the
chieftain when the steel mill lays off 200
[SPEAKER_02]: people temporarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because the impact that the city feels
when that happens is major.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 200 paychecks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if a thousand people say it's only
700, if 700 people stop bringing home
[SPEAKER_02]: paychecks because of this vote,
like that's 700 fewer people that can
[SPEAKER_02]: order dinner, uh, have pizza delivered,
go to the movies, go get another pair of
[SPEAKER_02]: sneakers, go get their kids' school
supplies, like all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 700 people that are going to be
applying for food stamps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 700 people that are going to be going
to food, unemployment, food pantries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 700 more stresses on an already
overtaxed system of support in this
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a small community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pointless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally like 1% of the people in
Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's 130 some thousand people down
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like the worst type of self
sabotage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really can't take it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, you know, the reason I wanted
to have this podcast, the reason I wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to talk about this issue is I want
everybody who supports cannabis to take it
[SPEAKER_03]: seriously because from my perspective on
social media and out in the community,
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody's really taking it seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that frightens me to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody took the idea that
they could shut down cannabis in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: West.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't seem like something feasible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh, they can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We voted it in, voted it in is what a lot
of people say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just get it on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can vote it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can vote it right out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like we voted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a weird election to run this
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, the anti-pop people tend to be
more conservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we just had a democratic president.
[SPEAKER_02]: For eight years, no, uh, no, no stretch in
American history.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had a two term president from one
party or another followed by a president
[SPEAKER_02]: from that same party.
[SPEAKER_02]: So history tells us that more
conservatives are going to turn out in
[SPEAKER_02]: this election than liberals to vote for
president, which means they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: at the polls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which means that if the youth vote and
the pro cannabis vote don't come out in
[SPEAKER_02]: force, this
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be a very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very, very,
very, very, very, very bad election.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to see states that have
liberalized their marijuana lives start to
[SPEAKER_02]: go the other way again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody needs to figure out if you're
registered to vote, figure out how to vote
[SPEAKER_02]: in your area, where to vote in your area
and get on top of that and stay on top of
[SPEAKER_02]: that all the way through the election in
November.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked not just Pueblo West everywhere,
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's important to me locally because
I could get fired in November and that
[SPEAKER_02]: would really suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a beautiful little boy that he's
got to take care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep Mike employed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a nice little life going right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a thanks in large part to the
recreational industry in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the medical industry in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all, or yeah, all of us are
basically working in legal cannabis in one
[SPEAKER_02]: way or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if rec goes this year,
I see a lot of the medical people like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you know, my shop will be doing
better if rec goes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For two years at most before this is an
election again, when even fewer liberals
[SPEAKER_02]: turn out and because they managed to kill
rec and Pueblo where it was so big last
[SPEAKER_02]: year, you're just going to be an easier
target.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's if we can't get unified on this,
it could get real ugly come November.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like my job people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, you should run for some
sort of office, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can he be mayor?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a mayor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I mean, you can be in and that
makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor really has no power though.
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs to run for city council.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's at large.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys tweet, tweet Mike and encourage
Mike to run for city council in the city
[SPEAKER_04]: of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limit at large.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limit at large.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limit at large.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys tweet him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hashtag lemon at large.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's already a hashtag,
but and then let him know that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: following him through the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow my buddy, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary, do you have any social?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not wrapping up the show, but since
I'm shy now, Mike, I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: completely fair to give you a social media
shout out if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, I've been recovering from a
serious accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to see you back on your feet and
doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, this is kind of one of my
first forays out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to the table appointments
and, you know, necessary training.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got like a, what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a, what I can see is probably a good
four inch gash on your forehead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes all the way to the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had 47 stitches and 39 staples in my
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I've also got a cracked cervical
vertebrae and a torn rotator cuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't even been addressed yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the accident was in December.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a long recovery.
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize it was that bad through
your Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you looked like a soldier on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I got in a wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a cool scar and I was like,
damn, I got fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm glad you're all right,
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you're all right, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to your son.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's doing awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight A student.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very proud of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a bright kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hanging out with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You forget that he's a kid sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's uh, no offense, but people don't
want to hear about our kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all the kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise them right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they're not listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was going to reroute this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, we really should touch on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mike's got to go, go, uh,
cough up a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to find a classier way to say
that, but why don't we break for a second?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break and
then, uh, we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I need a dab anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just got all high, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gary decided that somebody needs to
create an animated series based on my
[SPEAKER_04]: likeness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a copyright on my likeness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys can't fuck with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually do have a trademark on my
likeness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to tell you the name of the
company and everything, but that is
[SPEAKER_04]: patented.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't try to fuck with my likeness or
my name.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he just told me that I need to have a
cartoon of myself and I would have the
[SPEAKER_04]: lion of Judah as my sidekick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be Rasta Jeff and the lion Judah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd be walking around solving
cannabis related mysteries and or crimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wouldn't be like cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be like, you know, crimes against
cannabis, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you spraying that shit on your
plants while you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, you can't do that to the plants when
they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not going to let them do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they give me some shitty Jamaican
accent, would you want it to be me doing
[SPEAKER_04]: my own voice or would they hire like a
voiceover?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do your own voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more watchable if it's you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your regular voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we get a great,
you know, psychic character for the lion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to audition to be the lion,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you want to produce a fucking Rasta
Jeff themed cartoon, I am down as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see this happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Garrett Waller.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be a perfect Judah the lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Garrett Waller is funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd be a perfect lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta see if we got chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He kind of looks like a lion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a question of how many dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's episode number one?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we doing in episode number one?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's our mystery?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of, I'm seeing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm envisioning us like as the gonjas
more, more obviously gonjas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some motherfucker sold me some bunk ass
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking more like our plants got
stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us find out who took them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you track it back like up the
road or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could, you could even go like
fully educational and do like each episode
[SPEAKER_03]: is like a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, look, you've got, you've got
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta, Judith, I do cloning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it that way where you do it
funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the mystery solving thing,
but you could go education.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was much more Scooby Doo than it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's gotten educational Rosenthal,
but I think it could be both.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely could.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should go watch the Mike Tyson
mysteries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm thinking when I see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just replacing you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's great, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody wants to kind of replace the
Mike Tyson mysteries with me and my lion,
[SPEAKER_04]: Judah, I'm game.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say, I want to see me and I
would like to see it fighting crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be a superhero?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we give me, do I have a superpower?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, I think you can have powers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could talk to plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing about cartoons.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have powers, you know,
because they don't have to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that version better where you can
be super high and the line can be a
[SPEAKER_02]: superhero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be tally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is it's easy to be tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there'd be like a whole question
of whether the line is real or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of Wilfred like now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just about to say, don't go
Wilfred.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, not that far, but you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's your sidekick, but you know,
suddenly he's only there when I'm blazed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's we don't ever show me smoking or
talk about me smoking, but only when I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously high, Judah shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Judah, we need your help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody asked me a question that I don't
know the answer to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go find Judah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I come back with Judah and I've
got the answer, but those elements like
[SPEAKER_03]: the 70 show element, the Mike Tyson
mysteries element and the Scooby Doo
[SPEAKER_03]: elements.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could, you know, work those in,
we'll make it even funnier because these
[SPEAKER_02]: are hashtag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just what fucking dabbed out
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we told them we're going to take a
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not editing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is podcasting at its finest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, this is what three dudes that
have had too many dabs sit around and talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too many.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just too many.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could probably go for one more,
but I don't want to blow out the throat
[SPEAKER_04]: and try to record with that bad voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you guys get talking, I might take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So recently the DEA has announced that
they are going to investigate cannabis a
[SPEAKER_04]: little further.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within 90 days they will release their
opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather they decide to reschedule cannabis
as a schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an article on the thing here
because I'm no good with the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the numbers mixed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to reschedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it is currently listed as a
schedule one drug, meaning that for the
[SPEAKER_04]: purposes of federal law, the drug has no
medical value and a high potential for
[SPEAKER_04]: abuse and is one of the most dangerous
drugs of all drug schedules with
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially severe psychological or
physical dependence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That right there poses a really big
problem for the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a different branch of the
government owns a patent for medical uses
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can it have no medical uses and you
own the patent?
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been comfortable with that bit of
hypocrisy for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a case working its way through
the courts that is challenging that very
[SPEAKER_02]: issue that one of them has basically been
waiting for a decade to see this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this move is ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my initial thought on this move was
this is an establishment Democrat move to
[SPEAKER_03]: take some wind out of Bernie Sanders.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they reschedule before the election,
that kind of removes a key issue for
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanders.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we highlighted Sanders on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: As an establishment Democrat move,
it's kind of brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I was just expecting the DEA to swat
this down like they have every time,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we've gotten to this point in the
DEA trying to reschedule it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I haven't kept up as much as
I should have with this current
[SPEAKER_02]: incarnation of it, but I would be
surprised if that, but it could be,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you think they're giving up the queen
to save the king?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, socially the tide has turned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the number of states that have
legalized all of the things that are
[SPEAKER_04]: changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is definitely obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen the DNC, the Democratic
establishment do all kinds of shit to
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanders.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of fits the profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be a conspiracy
theorist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just see a massive political value for
Hillary Clinton.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it happens before the election.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge political value for her if
it happens before the election.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether it's intentional or
unintentional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I agree with Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that in under normal
circumstances, this is just the DEA is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to shuffle some papers around and
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've literally been taken to federal
court and lost and still still not
[SPEAKER_02]: complied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their own DEA law judge, like when the
original federal medical program was
[SPEAKER_02]: created, two citizens sued the feds,
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the DEA law judge that overheard
the case recommended that the DEA
[SPEAKER_02]: reschedule marijuana and their response
was to basically shame them into
[SPEAKER_02]: retirement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but what you have to understand and
what we all have to acknowledge here is
[SPEAKER_03]: that they are fully under the control of
the executive branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the president ordered them to do that
or they wouldn't have done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if the president ordered them not to
do it, they wouldn't have done it more
[SPEAKER_03]: than likely, more than likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, you know, all
probabilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the difference right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, the implications are really weird,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have several options.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and very possibly they, they could do
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what I expected to see
happen was this to come up again and then
[SPEAKER_02]: to say, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that tends to be the federal
response when it comes to marijuana is
[SPEAKER_02]: shake their head and say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if things go on the way they have
under normal circumstances, that's what we
[SPEAKER_03]: would all expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would they have even bothered to announce
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: If they weren't going to do something,
they didn't have to tell us it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the pressure, the story that I did
glance at, I don't think they announced it
[SPEAKER_02]: quite as intentional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they didn't mean for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a number of different news agencies
are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had like an ad forwarded the
wrong email to the wrong person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're going to be looking at this
between now and what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: August?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Memo was leaked to, I want to say it was
Matt for near, but I'm not positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I'm not sure that this was a
intended to be as public publicized as it
[SPEAKER_02]: has been, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: They, she gets leaked on purpose too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks to whoever leaked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have leaked it to, you know,
kind of test public sentiment on it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, see how it's going to fly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a comedian tweets a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just tweeted their joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they do nothing, then, you know,
we're where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing changes, except that whoever the
next president is then has the authority
[SPEAKER_03]: to come and shut all this shit down if
they want to under federal law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, don't kid yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trump will do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: His whole campaign sparks of that,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, his whole campaign is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't surprise me that you're
having Trump nightmares.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well put actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the DEA could possibly come out and
say, Hey, this does have medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but yeah, so option one, do nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's probably what the consensus,
what everybody expects, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But option two is they reschedule,
which means it goes somewhere between two
[SPEAKER_03]: and five on the, on the schedule,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: List.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, that puts it under the
jurisdiction of the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now if it's scheduled anywhere below
one, it's under FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even if it drops the two,
a lot of good things happen, a lot of good
[SPEAKER_02]: things, a lot of strange things happen
because we've spent an amazingly long time
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out how to make it too
punitive for people to risk smoking or
[SPEAKER_02]: having weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of those rules are still in place,
even in places like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rescheduling it anywhere on the
schedule still leaves some really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really, really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I said, in putting it anywhere
on the schedule, it makes it under the
[SPEAKER_03]: authority of the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that leaves a whole bunch of questions
of how, and you know, how, how would that
[SPEAKER_03]: even begin to work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not a typical pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I predicted me, I don't know if I've
said this on an episode before,
[SPEAKER_04]: what I predict, unfortunately,
maybe if we do go to a national,
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it would be medical first,
but it looks like we may have a national
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational program.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll find somebody, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, they're going to find somebody to
grow it and then it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: something friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a mass produced product
that is going to be, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: wipe out all the small grows like what
we've got going now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not happening that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a top down kind of affectation,
a political change, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening from the bottom up on the
state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: A third option they have, rather than
rescheduling, they could delist it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could de-schedule completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they could even go so far as to
recommend that, although it's delisted and
[SPEAKER_03]: not a scheduled drug, that it needs
special care so the ATF could become the
[SPEAKER_03]: ATFC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'd use marijuana instead of
cannabis in their acronym.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they wouldn't, but that's totally
on the list of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and some of the analysis that I
read, the policy analysis that if you look
[SPEAKER_03]: at, you know, kind of the recent history
of structuring government, this would
[SPEAKER_03]: probably be the way they would do it
because of integration with like Homeland
[SPEAKER_03]: Security, ATF has already fully
integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in this transition period where
we're going from illegal to legal,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ATF would be able to monitor the legal
grows and keep out cartels and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then their role would diminish as it
has with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the ATF was heavy in regulation
when alcohol first became legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they've, you know, eased off on
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, it's just regulated like
anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state regulatory agency has
inspectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The inspectors come by and check stuff
with something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a retail distributed intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there'd be the occasional ID sting,
but it's really not that complicated to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn it into a product just like anything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what de-scheduling it and
putting it under the ATF jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_03]: would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would solve the government's
problem of worrying about cartels getting
[SPEAKER_03]: in and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause then they could go to every state
and inspect them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without even having to put any
regulations on it, you know, just,
[SPEAKER_03]: just looking for money laundering and tax
evasion and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they do with the ATF does with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: They only do the top level alcohol stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think anybody else's thought this
idea through, or do you think this is
[SPEAKER_04]: something you're thinking?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't just make this shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I went out and read smarter
people than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what they think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the odds of them de-scheduling
cannabis in the next couple months is
[SPEAKER_02]: around like one or two or 3% at most.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the DAA does anything, it will likely
be lower the schedule a point or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So down to schedule two or three,
which I mean, we can debate for a really
[SPEAKER_02]: long time if it belongs on the schedule at
all or, and if so where, but I really
[SPEAKER_02]: don't think the DAA is going to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's historically what they've
always done is just nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The marijuana is too big a piece of the
drug war pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where 80% of all drug consumers,
all illicit drug consumers only consume
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take cannabis out of that equation and
they've got a real hard time justifying a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of their budgets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they spend so many times
flying around or so much time flying
[SPEAKER_02]: around shopping down cannabis plants in
the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they, if they don't,
they don't get paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they do federally regulate it to
another schedule, is Mike going to have to
[SPEAKER_04]: become a pharmacist basically now to be a
budtender?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to have to wear a lab coat and
go a little bit more extreme and get
[SPEAKER_04]: major, some sort of pharmaceutical
accreditation?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it wouldn't be the word I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't change state laws,
but it would give the FDA an opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: to basically do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on where it falls on the
schedule, budtending would still be a
[SPEAKER_02]: federal offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if it moved to just schedule two,
the ability for doctors to research it
[SPEAKER_02]: would increase greatly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main hurdles right now is if
you get your whole study approved,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's only one small place where you can
get the cannabis from.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you watch Sanjay Gupta's marijuana
specials, you can check out where that
[SPEAKER_02]: place is and what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the supply is still drastically
limited and with the number of different
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds in the cannabis plant,
the number of different medical
[SPEAKER_02]: applications that people in our industry
have seen hinted at, but would like
[SPEAKER_02]: further research on, all of those studies
get a lot easier to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it only moves to two, it opens up
everything basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as research goes, yeah,
that door really opens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would we be able to study cannabis at the
University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: or Colorado State University Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't think the DEA is going to
move on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the federal government moves,
in my opinion, it will because an acting
[SPEAKER_02]: president rallies Congress just like they
do on countless other issues using the
[SPEAKER_02]: bully pulpit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be a long drawn out process is my
opinion, but who knows the DEA could jump
[SPEAKER_02]: for all kinds of reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the analysis that I read,
and this was a policy analysis from Pew
[SPEAKER_03]: Research Institute, their take on it is
right now, nobody knows what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this election cycle, basically
everybody's pulling out all the stops.
[SPEAKER_02]: All bets are off.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The benefit here in this situation for
Clinton could be the tipping point,
[SPEAKER_03]: could be the thing that does after all
these fucking years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, he gave about five examples of
that's how shit works in this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough support out there that it
could get done without too much turmoil
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obama's a lame duck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on his way out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The door's about to close on his ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never said a nice word about him
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't give a fuck what the opponents
think.
True.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about two election vote
situations where about 100 people voiced
[SPEAKER_04]: their concern on one way and two or three
people stood up and voiced their concern
[SPEAKER_04]: on the opposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, the council members went
with the lower votes in both cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Colorado Springs recently on two
very different issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very different issues, but it went the
same damn way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're seeing here in Southern
Colorado, we're seeing the culture war
[SPEAKER_03]: really starting to bubble up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing this movement, this whatever
it is movement against marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing the city council in Colorado
Springs taking all kinds of actions that
[SPEAKER_03]: are just really opposed to public outcry.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those is on marijuana, but there
were other issues like completely
[SPEAKER_03]: unrelated to marijuana where the public
was really vocal on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They still moved directly against it right
away and with the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting thick around here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting thick nationally too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Politics goes in cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull out a history book or just if you're
older, think back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes liberal, conservative,
liberal, conservative, and it has for the
[SPEAKER_02]: last 100 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bush followed Reagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, but it's getting more and more
conservative right now because it got more
[SPEAKER_02]: and more liberal for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made some nice progress on some nice
issues, but at the same time, the
[SPEAKER_02]: conservative folks, the anti-pot groups,
they've been getting clobbered in election
[SPEAKER_02]: after election and council meeting after
council meeting and license hearing after
[SPEAKER_02]: license hearing and they're pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Motivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down here, they're going with the nuclear
option and it seems like they are
[SPEAKER_02]: nationally too given Trump's popularity,
but if more people don't get active,
[SPEAKER_02]: that takes paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes some dedication.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes reading the news occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes staying informed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that you can just do
overnight, but if more people are aged,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more people that aren't into cannabis
don't start getting involved, it could get
[SPEAKER_02]: real ugly for the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight years at least.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Register and vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Register and vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say the ball is in your
hands, but that just sounds gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote your conscience on the presidential
candidate, but support the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone at this table realize heavily in
the cannabis industry, the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I want to add.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come from the black market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come from the dark side of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there weren't a legal cannabis market,
you know where I would be?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd probably still be part of the black
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be crushing the black market just like
I used to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a legitimate job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pay a lot of damn taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a time clock now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing everything legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got manifests and invoices for every
grandma product I produce now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a lot of time in the gray world
working for caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: One by one, it dried up because it was too
much of a hassle now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough profit in Colorado
because most of that's going to the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: market now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike and I got to watch the whole thing
shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't take long either.
[SPEAKER_04]: The street to the caregiver model,
to the kind of a dispensary, to the
[SPEAKER_04]: sketchy-ass dispensary, to the,
okay, that's a dispensary, to,
[SPEAKER_04]: holy shit, this is regularly- Really nice
shit we have now.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the clubs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the clubs, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to all the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mainly all of the Mikes out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is part of a team.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm part of a team.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get all the glory because I've got a
show with my face on the fucking label.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a seed company that I hype a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the Instagram that everybody
checks out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: For every one of me, there are three or
four people supporting what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just me that's able to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give Mike a fist bump because
he's the closest one to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That fist bump is for all the people that
make this shit possible because it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: just a one-man effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get all the Facebook and Instagram love.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all you guys also.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a huge community.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't get enough support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's been there since the beginning with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since fucking Mike helped me transplant
clones back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the way day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember when your grill room was
like 110 degrees?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's not even go here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not even go here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when it was three foot by three
foot, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when you could bake potatoes on
the floor, that bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the learning days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The learning days were fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of years of experience, a lot of
battles that were fought years before the
[SPEAKER_02]: show started going to making it and giving
you guys decades worth of lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're still listening, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to fail a thousand times to learn
the hundred things that I learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to fail so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to sit through hundreds of hours of
council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundred ounces?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundred ounce council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds of hours of council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just watching the process happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching how things normally happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching conviction on cultivation of a
large farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: One supported that and learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going through and watching it took up
hundreds of hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that all of this is going down,
we can be active in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come from the dark side, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come into the legal regulated market,
pay some taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, now I was able to go to a car
dealership and they're like, so what do
[SPEAKER_04]: you do for work?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I have a pay stub and I work
at a legitimate place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, we'll give you a fat
credit instead of like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pay cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just buy a car?
[SPEAKER_04]: And looking sketchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt way better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just walk in there and be like,
look, I have like a real line of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just come from the dark side,
join the regulated market, get legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have to look over your shoulder all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a eyesore on the movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I see people, there'll be a
legalization effort running in their area
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'll be fighting it because it's
not enough in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at Colorado's rules and
how it all hashed out, like it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: enough in our eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clubs are a big issue, but they're not
even close to the only issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not enough yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality of the situation is it's
the best scenario anyone's got on the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that can really improve for
us is pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that comes in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We watched that happen with the medical
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: As more states legalize, as the tourism
industry dips down a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: as more shops open, as competition gets
better, as people become more talented.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of brother-in-laws that got
hired to grow a lot of warehouse weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't come out so hot for some of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, growers still tend to be a
problem for dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to predict a cannabis shortage this
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state estimates we're a ton or more
under consumption for our production right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not even close to meeting demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I bust out a humble brag?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run an 80, we have 85.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I heard these numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: 85 lights in the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I pulled 200 and I think 217-ish
pounds is what I think I remember reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 217 and a half pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw your boss post it on social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't remember the exact number
because I remember thinking 237,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that might just be a number I made up
in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds close.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I could go look, but I'm high as
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that number has gone in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, between 215 and 230 something
pounds of usable cannabis underneath 85
[SPEAKER_04]: lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: We pulled about 2.2 pounds per light is
what I think we math that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe 2.5 or something like that is what I
did the math on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'll do what I can to produce
those tonnages of cannabis that we need
[SPEAKER_04]: for the summer, you guys, but I can't
promise you that it'll all be out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, everybody got to do their part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Push out 200 something pounds from 85
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look at the table for a second and
then think back to 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's where they are in
Louisiana, Texas, New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, countless other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're where we are 10 or 15 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give them five or six years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dab thing is catching on.
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet moves us more quickly and
people travel a lot more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to blame a lot of things on
the traveling of jam bands and the music
[SPEAKER_04]: scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: When widespread goes on tour, they're
going to stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're in Austin this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: People that traveled from Colorado to
Austin are introduced, and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_04]: Austin's already got dabs and shit,
but they're introducing more people to
[SPEAKER_04]: shatter right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dabbing after the widespread show
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that's made it out, but like law
wise, what happens if you get caught with
[SPEAKER_02]: it like in Ohio or a number of those
middle states that nobody thinks about a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's there's a lot of states where
having cannabis is a major offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if you're sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if you have cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if you've got Crohn's
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take your kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my crew from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can still listen,
but I got a crew that's from Ohio that
[SPEAKER_04]: listens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to all them kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Magoo, what up, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I was in Louisiana a year ago,
I watched somebody get like grabbed and
[SPEAKER_02]: thrown to the ground for smoking a joint,
got handcuffed in front of the back of the
[SPEAKER_02]: squad car, like in party city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's no joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of places in the laws move slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Louisiana just changed their laws,
though, and it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to be on the road to
legalization very, very slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they the current regs are up to two
and a half pounds is a misdemeanor for
[SPEAKER_03]: your possession and a transfer of up to an
ounce to another adult is a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got one of the worst three strikes
laws in the country, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can pretty much walk out of their
jail from what I've seen on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pretty much just get up and leave if
you feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's it's not something you want to
play with in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the laws slow to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to cough into the microphone,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs are happening here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rigs going back around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you got skipped because you cough a
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to give you one as we start
wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll come back this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take it personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like it when they like it when we I
forgot what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when you ramble.
You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been kind of a crazy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some weird places.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're almost an hour and we're over an
hour and 10 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anybody have anything important they
want to wrap up a podcast with?
[SPEAKER_03]: How about everybody make their prediction
for the election?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who will be the nominee for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too early for that shit with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in preseason.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't make me call the Super Bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you think will be the nominees?
[SPEAKER_02]: That that's still too early to call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think they're going to give
it to Trump.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting to see the country flip out
when the guy who gets the most votes
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't get the nomination, because,
dude, you can't put the crazy person in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room with the button.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way the RNC lets that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're assholes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking anti-American,
in my opinion, but they're not that
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same point, they haven't put
forward a contender.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Trump presidency creates so much
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our economy takes a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been stepping to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big step by big step for the last 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what happens when you step off
the cliff at the end of the red side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That paired with the systematic defunding
of public education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I usually keep my mouth shut on
politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if if Trump is afraid of Megyn Kelly,
how is he going to fucking deal with ISIS?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good that's a good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're wrapping up the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you follow all of us on all of
the social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_04]: Find him in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shake his hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a cannabis consultant.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your cannabis business going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Help my friend out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all we've got.

[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to Rastaseb.
[SPEAKER_04]: 12.30 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably 12.30 in the afternoon for
Rastaseb.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll start Facebook messaging me here in
just a minute or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hang out and talk on Facebook for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get, I don't want to promise
you anything I can't deliver, but I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to get Jesse back for an outdoor
episode really soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: More emails and stuff to respond to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more listener questions coming up in
the next episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys join me for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank my friends for coming over
and spending a long time hanging out at
[SPEAKER_04]: the kitchen today, taking a bunch of dabs.

show, let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back and have you guys again.

everybody.

ninja Spence, and until next time,
[SPEAKER_04]: take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for
me.
What
[SPEAKER_01]: I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steal your face right off your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a steam locomotive rolling down the
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's gonna bring him back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a 10 mile ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart is a pestle, but cool inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad on a tin roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs in a pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing left to do but smile, smile,
smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now
[SPEAKER_01]: he's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a steam locomotive rolling down the
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's gonna bring him back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
More
[SPEAKER_01]: of the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same old fat in a chain ditch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caught on
[SPEAKER_01]: what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steal your face right off your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a steam locomotive rolling down the
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a steam locomotive rolling down the
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's gonna bring him back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone.
He's gone.
