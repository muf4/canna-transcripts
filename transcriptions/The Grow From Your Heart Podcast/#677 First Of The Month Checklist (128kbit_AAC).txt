[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 677 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to go over a
little checklist I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a list of things that can help us
keep our plants and our garden and our
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment in top working order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that list, let's do a few
shout outs to a few of those great folks

[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen and you know I do
[SPEAKER_00]: include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of show notes and video
descriptions, this is the part of the show
[SPEAKER_00]: where I invite you to join the iRead
Genetics Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are approximately 1500 members of
the iRead Genetics Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I don't know why you were
missing the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great things going on
on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing actions and waffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today somebody got a great pack of
unreleased seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a one of one pack,
some seeds that have never been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the only pack so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got that on the Discord on a waffle
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to get access to that was the
Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are waffles happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is yoga going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's grow talk happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's help and advice and just random
hanging out over on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do invite you join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link of course in the show notes
and the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to seeing you on the
Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there as soon as I'm done
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little while for that file from
that camera and that camera to load up
[SPEAKER_00]: into the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they load, I go take dabs in the
Discord server with the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my way of winding down and
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be there when you pop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough rambling about the Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into the main topic of
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to the main part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show will come out right before the
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it actually comes out on the 31st
if there are that many days this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't keep good count.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be right about the first as this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many people listen to this episode,
it will be the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good time to run through a
checklist of things in our garden to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that everything is in top working
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things get overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm extremely busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is harvest season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shifting from the summer to the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the warm to the cold is what I call
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to rebuild all the indoor
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is harvest time for the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be a lot of seeds to
shuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get that busy, a lot of things
get overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that there's that one corner
that doesn't get swept.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that one tray that doesn't
get washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that one plant in the back that
gets ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now time to make sure we get to all
those small details because over time they
[SPEAKER_00]: will build up and that's what causes us
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay on top of your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is it is the first of the
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good time to go through the
checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also payday so you should have a few
bucks to handle any supplies or
[SPEAKER_00]: corrections that need to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, now is the time to start
thinking about budgeting more properly for
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow because shit will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will go awry and we've got to
return money into our investment if we
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to keep returning for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me get myself back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of the month update.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would think about is
clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All everything in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything outside the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything involved in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got lights with the glass
reflection, with the glass space there,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's clean that glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got air conditioners,
if you've got fans, let's clean all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it needs to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work your way all the way down to the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the tops of the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tops of my lights get really dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of that gets really dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got LED lights, turn off the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to clean your lights,
let them cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the lights cool down before you clean
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean all the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got LEDs, clean the diodes
really carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you do that with your
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the instructions, but it may be time
to clean your lights and your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: A buddy gave me a clone and it came with
free fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should have quarantined that sucker
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around my grow light, there are a
bunch of fungus gnats right around the LED
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get some Q-tips and some rubbing
alcohol and clean out all the dead fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things like that that will need to
be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing you've been avoiding,
there's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got that one area, that one
little thing that's a pain in the ass to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dedicate that day to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cleaning day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about stuff in depth that we
should clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often overlook cleaning filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got air conditioner filters that
need to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your carbon filters still working?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have those carbon filters been
around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to replace them?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time you replace your carbon
filter, get a piece of duct tape and write
[SPEAKER_00]: the date on that duct tape and put that
somewhere on your carbon filter just so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look and say, this has been here
for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to give you two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to be good for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine don't last that long, which is a
compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that I'm growing the dank and
you can smell it and that carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: just ain't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I replace it about every year or so,
maybe every year and a half, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: you're supposed to get two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go outside, give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come back directly into the grow
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk around outside the grow area and see,
can you smell it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring somebody new.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if they smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably gone nose blind and you
don't even smell your grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the carbon filter working?
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean your filters, your air
conditioner filters, your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about in your hydro setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I run a hydro setup,
I put a filter that goes from the tank
[SPEAKER_00]: between the tank and the emitter there is
a filter thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a 45 degree angle that hangs
down so that all the heavy shit falls into
[SPEAKER_00]: there as the water passes through the
watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has that filter been taken out and cleaned
thoroughly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned your hydro lines like the
whole system, starting from the pump all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way down to the emitters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just take the emitters out of the
plants if you can and just run some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of cleaner through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe an enzyme, maybe some Fizan,
something just to clean all that shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be surprised what comes out of
your watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I build tables, with long big auto
watering systems and long PVC pipes and
[SPEAKER_00]: long flex tubes, we make a cap on one inch
where we can open it and actually blast
[SPEAKER_00]: water through and clean it and you would
be amazed at all of the nutrient buildup
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the gunk and junk that builds up
inside those lines and you don't know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there and you're basically feeding the
plants that stuff every time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watering and you don't know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a minute, clean out your hydro
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff may be built up with gunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: An enzymatic product will definitely help
break that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fizan 20 will push it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make sure you rinse that stuff out of
your system, out of the hydro lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of all the tubes, out of everything
before you put it back, put the emitters
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to put high, high resign or
too much high resign or too much Fizan
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural part is fine, but you don't
want to do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cleaning ratio will be stronger than
what you're using for feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean all those tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the glass on the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about if you have vented lights,
clean that glass between the bulb and your
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is dirty, that's going to
drastically reduce the amount of lumens
[SPEAKER_00]: that make it from the light bulb down to
your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That glass is already cutting enough down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any speck of dirt, any foliar feed,
any pesticide spray that gathered on that
[SPEAKER_00]: lens is going to drastically reduce the
amount of light that makes it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will drastically reduce light
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of bulbs, how long has it been
since you've taken a light meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lumen meter, a PAR meter, any sort of
meter to your lights to test how much
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting out?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using HPS or metal halides,
they put out a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn them down, but they're still
putting out whatever you've got it turned
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's putting out a hundred percent of that
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the bulb giving you a hundred percent
of those lumens?
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation when you get a new bulb,
get a PAR meter, some sort of a meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: something reliable that you're going to
use next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a basic lumen meter is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a piece of string or a ruler or a tape
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some way that you can measure
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to say is get a piece of
string about 18 inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 18 inches, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a piece of string about 18 inches long
and tie it to the end of your lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put one end at the light and then hold it
the length of that string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, every time you measure, you're 18
inches from the light and see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: number is on your lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that number down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every few months, every couple of
months, hold that lumen meter up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: light at the same distance and see what
number it is showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's gone down to, if it's 30%,
50% less than what it was showing you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is definitely time to change that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for a hundred percent of
that electricity and you're getting 50 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of the output from that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you swap out that bulb, you'll get a
hundred percent output again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be getting the electricity that
you're paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the cost of that bulb offsetting the
waste of electricity that you're spending?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pumping the electricity into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a bulb that will give us the
light that we're paying for, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So test your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark the date somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do get a new bulb, when you do
finally replace those bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the gross store that I used to shop at
a long time ago, before things got real
[SPEAKER_00]: busy, when you would buy a new bulb,
they would take the bulb out of the box
[SPEAKER_00]: and write the date on the little copper
part that screws into the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I wanted to see the date of my
bulb, I had to unscrew it and take it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I take a piece of duct tape and I
write the date that I put a new bulb in my
[SPEAKER_00]: light fixture and I put that duct tape on
the light fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know when that light went in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's printed right there on the light
fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to look right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that went in January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got plenty of time on that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's measure the lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how long it's been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how many lumens it's given me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the notes you make are setting
yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what inspired us to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy getting just just a nice
little buzz, just getting in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little stony focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get baked a little bit and then go in the
grow and put on some music and just get in
[SPEAKER_00]: the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sometimes I'll come out and be
like huh I don't even know what I just did
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past four hours in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if you do something you got a
note like hey I did this and this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next time you want to do great
results you got some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say I did this and this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just the same when you're marking
down your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did I buy these bulbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did I buy this carbon filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did I install whatever equipment I'm
using?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did I buy that air conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your receipts also because when shit
breaks and you want to argue with them for
[SPEAKER_00]: their warranty you're gonna need that
receipt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I on this list?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark all your dates and new stuff down
somewhere easy to find either on a
[SPEAKER_00]: clipboard on the door or put duct tape on
the gear that you're marking the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: The filters and the emitters on your hydro
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those need to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be cleaned in a big
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cleaning those almost every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would walk through as we're watering
walk the rows and make sure all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters are spraying and if one's not
spraying you'd have a little bucket or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little dish with more emitters in your
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pull one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the dead one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the fresh one in and then we'd go put
those dirty emitters and a bucket with
[SPEAKER_00]: either like rubbing alcohol or Fizan or
H2O2 something just to kind of pre-clean
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then later in the day somebody
would go and poke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those in the clean bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got new fresh ones tomorrow so
that when you find all the dead emitters
[SPEAKER_00]: just replace them and that's because we
used a bunch of chunky nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff we were using the carbon
narrow area and the shine together would
[SPEAKER_00]: really clog up the hydro system so we'd
really have to do some cleaning on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get myself back on focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean all of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the equipment in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then clean all of your tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take out the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean all of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what is dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have... Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on notes because I
do have some notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not think the ceiling's dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in between there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the Dosatron working properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a big facility device but
let's test that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it working properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go in and make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've got this bottle set up to
spit seven milliliters per dosing every
[SPEAKER_00]: time just pull out the emitter and see if
it's actually spitting out however many
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters you think it's actually
spitting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test the Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if all the auto automated
equipment... Automated was the word I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if all of the automated feeding
equipment is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all of the automation working?
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay a lot of money for automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay a lot of money to rely on that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it working the way we think it is
working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's test all of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you think you've got set to cycle
on or cycle off at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you checked it in a while?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you checked the timers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the timers where you think they are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you think that you changed that
fan to come on at a certain time and go
[SPEAKER_00]: off at a certain time when you change the
timer but maybe you missed a fan or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just double checking because it's the
first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good time to make a checklist and
run through and make sure you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: everything because again we do get
overloaded as growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also smoke a little bit of ganja so we
do have a tendency to miss some detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just trying to make a list to help
you out to set you up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what else are we going to think about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the drains clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the luxury in a commercial
environment to have a floor drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all those drains clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need to be clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to run a snake down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to get a plumber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need some help getting those drains
cleared?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the drains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about stuff that
everybody's got going on in their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scissor and mix area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little table where I keep my
scissors and all my mixing stuff and my
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that area cleaned up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that clean and tidy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get more work done if you've got a
nice area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have all kinds of excessive shit on
your workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use these bottles maybe have these
bottles right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some notes here on how to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your measuring equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have like some towels or some rags to
clean up some messes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your safety equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you don't really need a lot of
other, you don't need a bunch of excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: shit around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes, it's distracting and it
makes messes and it will slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is your area clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about your scissors and your mixing
cups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a scale for powder nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your scale for measuring nutrients
clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it calibrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something important to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that scale calibrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm using that to measure five
grams of powdered nutrients per gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that thing is off, then I am not
feeding properly at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we can double check with our EC and
our pH meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those clean and calibrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those need attention as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we may not think about but I
think needs attention are the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: alarms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke detectors and carbon monoxide
detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they been tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in good working condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are gonna possibly save a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fire alarms, CO2 alarms, and then you
need that fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have a fire, hopefully you've
got a fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that bad dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to use the fire
extinguisher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Having it is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing how to use it is another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna shit your pants and freak
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're gonna pull the pin, aim toward
the bottom of the fire, and spray in
[SPEAKER_00]: bursts in a sweeping motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one are you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So be ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, how about a first aid kit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to get hurt in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been cutting grows before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people have problems in grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a basic first aid kit,
it can really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may be in a place where you
shouldn't be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's gonna happen if you're growing some
ganja and you cut your finger or you get
[SPEAKER_00]: pH down in your eye and you need some
emergency medical help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who you gonna call?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully Ghostbusters is in your
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got a friend that can back you
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not able to call 911 and say,
hey, I'm working in my weed garden in my
[SPEAKER_00]: basement and I got pH down in my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to call a friend and guide
them to you and get some help and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I gotta get to the doctor,
but we can't let them know what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan in place of some shit like
that is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you going to call?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, we've got all these devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my iPhone where I can open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can unlock it really easily without too
much complication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can speak to it to give it commands to
who to call for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you don't have that sort of
device, you gotta figure out some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: backup plan of what you're gonna do if
shit does go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta have somebody in mind that can
get to you and help you out before the
[SPEAKER_00]: police get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be something you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anything to go wrong,
but I want you to have a plan if it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: A basic first aid kit could really help
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some Band-Aids, some gauze,
some tape in there, maybe a tourniquet or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you might need,
but a basic first aid kit could really
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of basic first aid, how about
personal protective equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are applying pesticides or
doing some sort of spray applications in
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned your respirator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to clean your mask
properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been properly trained or have you
read how to clean your respirator and your
[SPEAKER_00]: mask?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your cartridges up to date?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have the proper cartridges
in your mask and they've got to be new and
[SPEAKER_00]: not expired and not have too many miles on
them or you're basically just wearing that
[SPEAKER_00]: mask for discomfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you keep your carts up to date and keep
your mask clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how about your suits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using fresh Tyvek suits every
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to recycle those
suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you guys clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just basically a responsibility
checklist that I'm just trying to remind
[SPEAKER_00]: you to clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten to the scissors, the pH
equipment, the measuring equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about your measuring cups?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got measuring cups and shot
glasses that I use to measure nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour a cleaner in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it with a rag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you need to use it, it's nice
and clean and nice and shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one less problem you're going to have
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: One less thing slowing you down when
you're trying to get work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me catch my breath and see where I am
in the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has it been since you've cleaned
your sprayer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you were spraying your plants
with, how long has it been since you've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually given that thing a good cleaning?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a handheld pump sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the commercial grow, we use paint
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those will need maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The handheld sprayer, you need to run some
clean water through it and clean that hose
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be stuff stuck in the tubes
and you don't want to spray the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: product on your plants at the wrong time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you've mixed up this and
there's still some of the last previous
[SPEAKER_00]: spray left in the tubes, that could cause
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paint sprayers can be a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They oftentimes need reprimed and they
definitely need to be cleaned out very
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your paint sprayer up to speed by
just general maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of good videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that almost every brand paint
sprayer, I think the one that we like the
[SPEAKER_00]: most is the Graco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a great YouTube presence where
you can read about repriming and cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: all those machines really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to talk about that,
but I think it's really helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got, I think it's Graco is the
name of the brand, the blue one,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the image in my head,
but I can't think of the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's Graco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to YouTube and type in Graco
paint sprayer, all the info you need is
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll teach you how to take it apart and
rebuild it and you can do it in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save yourself a lot of money on a
maintenance plan from that company because
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll come fix it for you, but you can
do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy and you don't want to
wait for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to spray today, you need that
shit fixed and they take a week to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just fix it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the videos are right there on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take care of your paint sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that bitch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will tell me that a paint
sprayer isn't the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very effective for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what I'm doing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a fogger now is definitely
the time to clean out your fogger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time to do a dump?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're approaching harvest season right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to have a lot of sticks,
a lot of stems, a lot of root balls,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of leftover junk that they don't
need from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an indoor grow and you're
pulling down crops every couple of months,
[SPEAKER_00]: where are all those sticks and root balls
and leftover?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's all that shit going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time for you to do a dump run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes my garage builds up a little bit
of a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all grow waste and grow trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait till I've got a nice pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we do a dump run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just take it all to the dump at one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of doing just a bunch of small
runs, we take it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time for you to do a dump run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been building up a bunch of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That big pile is going to contribute to
where bugs can hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've had a pest problem and you threw
all that shit out in the garage,
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the backyard, the bugs are building
there and they're going to work their way
[SPEAKER_00]: back into your grow eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of all of that trash,
that old root ball stuff, those old
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to do a dump run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is time for a dump run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we on my list of good stuff
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are to the part that should be
obvious to a lot of people, but gets often
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to clean and calibrate our pH
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pH meters need to be calibrated
approximately once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have a check mark on it that
shows you that it is calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes a couple of minutes to
calibrate it, especially once you get good
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it every week, you'll get out
your seven solution and your four
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, and you'll be able to go bloop,
bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, and you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: them calibrated in just a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take you time at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I do recommend is having more
than one calibration standard available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the four solution and the
seven solution, maybe have another bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seven solution and test them to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you take it out of the seven,
put it in the other seven and see if they
[SPEAKER_00]: both read seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you know that one of your
solutions isn't bad and you were properly
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to clean and calibrate your
pH pin, your pH meter, however cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: however expensive it is, now is a good
time to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember if the pH meter dries,
it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you keep it moist,
keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work much better for a much longer
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the EC pins, your electrical
conductivity or your TDS meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever one you're using, the PPM EC,
there are a lot of meters you can use,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that one also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work much better and last much
longer if you clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think those need much calibration,
but do clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about nutrient inventory?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is the first of the month,
that is a good time to do a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake your bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you low on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to go buy some stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to order some things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to restock on stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really good time to check and see
what you might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look through the rest of the month in your
grow schedule and say, we're gonna feed
[SPEAKER_00]: this, we're gonna feed this, we're gonna
feed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when it comes time to mix in your
bloom booster, you don't grab the bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: and go, oh, I should have ordered that a
week ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's order it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we've got all of the stuff we
need throughout the grow and there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: surprises, no late fucking products,
no missing products in our reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got everything we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just order the shit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're gonna order nutrients,
how about pesticide inventory?
[SPEAKER_00]: What pesticide products do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time to order more pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just say, shake the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go down and just shake the bottles
and if one feels light, I write it down
[SPEAKER_00]: and order another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let yourself run out of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're gonna need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one that's gonna order it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that shit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinvest some of your last harvest back
into the next harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make the next grow better every
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about other basic inventory?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are other things that I always need
to order for my grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are constantly ordering gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many pair of gloves do you go through
a day in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big math equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how long you're in there and
how many times you change gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply that by however many times a week
you're in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply that times four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many pairs of gloves you go
through in a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many boxes do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's order them now so that we don't have
to sit around and wait for gloves to come
[SPEAKER_00]: when we do need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to order gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to wear a mask,
especially the Tremors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's order all the masks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Masks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fun word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order all of the shit that you think you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you need in your grow,
but let's order it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through a lot of clone plugs,
like a lot of rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through a lot of plant tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basic things that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to order that stuff on the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to make one trip to the grow store
or I get one big box from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saves on shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saves on moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just makes it so much easier to do one big
monthly order.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another thing we're going to
segue into that a lot of people may have
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's double check our security.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have going on for your
security?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I recommend is just if
wherever you're growing, whatever building
[SPEAKER_00]: it is in, if you're growing in a room,
inside of a house, let's just check the
[SPEAKER_00]: security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk around outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see, are there any light leaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear any fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you smell anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that would tip you off
that there is a grow inside of that room
[SPEAKER_00]: or that building?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you can find it, that means
that thieves, that means it snitches,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that means that cops can find that
grow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want those folks finding our
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk around, see if you can see any light
leaking out of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you smell anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear any sort of air conditioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear shit cycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel vibrations from the blowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go check outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing like in a big building,
walk around the whole building.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a room inside of a
building, check that outside of that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then check like if you're growing in
the room adjacent to this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: sit in this room and see if you hear a
smell or see anything that would alert you
[SPEAKER_00]: to a grow in the other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just double check your security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then check your safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that all locked up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way for anybody to get in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: People often forget that when you put an
air conditioner in the window,
[SPEAKER_00]: all I gotta do is push that air
conditioner in and I'm in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hint that it's there and it's an
entryway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that shit in mind when you're
building your rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give me too many access points and
give me too many hints.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are out there and they're trying to
get shit from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird time right now and people are
going fucking crazy for anything they can
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check your security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have security cameras?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have security camera footage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have backups of your security
camera footage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have all your cameras set up the
way that they need to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about where all of that camera
footage is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that saved somewhere within your house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it on a DVR in your house where that
DVR could possibly be stolen or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: backed up somewhere to the internet to
where it's stored in a cloud in a server
[SPEAKER_00]: to where that footage is always accessible
and can't be taken away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another detail I would think about is how
long has it been since you've changed your
[SPEAKER_00]: security codes and passwords and who has
keys?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a facility with a gate,
maybe you had to give keys to an
[SPEAKER_00]: electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe an HVAC tech has a key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe an old employee has a key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where those keys are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, who has pass codes to your alarm
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who has pass codes to your cameras?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who has any sort of passwords or codes to
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now may be the time to do that thing where
you log out of all devices, change your
[SPEAKER_00]: password and log back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now may be the time to do that sort of
stuff, especially if you had any firing,
[SPEAKER_00]: rehiring, any breakups, any shifts,
any rifts in the matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now may be the time to change passwords
and do some sort of security upgrades,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what people are up to,
especially now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are weird, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back up your security footage,
change your security passwords and
[SPEAKER_00]: security codes just because we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe also change any locks that may need
to be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some other things
that you may need to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have MSDS sheets?
[SPEAKER_00]: MSDS sheets are very important in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to get a product in your eye
or accidentally think that the pH down was
[SPEAKER_00]: kombucha and you pick it up and take a
drink of it and you gotta go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital, they're gonna wanna know all of
the information about all of the products
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have exposed yourself or consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an MSDS sheet for all of your
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever in a commercial grow,
we're required to have a folder of MSDS
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime we get a new product, like if this
was a grow product, this is just a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of water, but if this was a nutrient,
as soon as it came into the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put it on the table and I would go
to the internet and I would type in this
[SPEAKER_00]: product, MSDS sheet, and I would print
that MSDS sheet out and put it in a folder
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would be alphabetically in a folder
that sits on a desk with the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: logs and a few other important logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, we are required to
have those sheets for every product that
[SPEAKER_00]: is inside of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your personal grow, it would just be a
good idea just in case something does go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong just to have that product there,
that product MSDS sheet there available
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would have is a spray
log.
[SPEAKER_00]: In commercial environments, we're required
to write down every pesticide application
[SPEAKER_00]: we spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We write down what room we sprayed,
what products we sprayed, how much of that
[SPEAKER_00]: product was applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We write down the EPA number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We write down the number of the employee
who sprayed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got an EPA number and a training
number as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of details that go along
with the spray product, so I recommend a
[SPEAKER_00]: spray log even in your personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help you out for a couple of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't want you to get sick,
I don't want you to spray pesticides in
[SPEAKER_00]: your eyes, I don't want you to get any
sort of rash, but if you do and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: that pesticide log and the MSDS sheet,
you've got some hints, some clues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've got to take you to the hospital
because you're in anaphylactic shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: those two things may help me out to figure
out how to save your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MSDS sheet and the spray log I
think are very important even in a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just consider those MSDS sheets and those
spray logs as part of the notes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be taking anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be taking copious notes with
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be making a nice journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things go right, you're going to want
to be able to repeat that process and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got good notes, then you know
exactly what you did and you can repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just guess, you're just guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows if we're going to get it right
again next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like grandma's cake recipe or
grandma's breakfast recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just guess and throw some of
this shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might work, but it's not going to be
the same every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have notes, if you've got
documentation, we can repeat the process
[SPEAKER_00]: and in a commercial environment,
that's what's required is a repeatable,
[SPEAKER_00]: improvable process with quantifiable
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another thing that most growers may
not think about, but once you get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more advanced, maybe I think about it
because I'm a business owner and I work in
[SPEAKER_00]: big commercial industry grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about an expense report?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are you spending on your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you documenting your monthly
electrical bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you documenting your monthly water
bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you documenting how much you spend on
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you documenting how much you spent on
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you documenting how much you spent on
the equipment and setting up the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you considering your time and energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you paying yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you documenting how many hours a week
or a month you spend in that grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just start writing down an expense
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are we spending?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time are we putting into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's also keep good notes on the
home harvest reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down every gram you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that you pull out of there,
let's document that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over time, you'll have a couple of
quantifiable reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see what you're spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see if you're spending more or
less than when you started and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're pulling more or less product
than when you started and you can see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were improving or if you're getting
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe then you can find areas to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start taking notes, you start
seeing like, oh, I could have done this
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could have done this better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time we did this and we didn't get as
much herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time we did this, we got more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start seeing those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start taking copious notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that having a journal and
taking a lot of notes is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you see that cost and expense
sheet, then you really see like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I used to spend, uh, 300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing how much a week or a
month you might spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to spend 300 bucks a month on herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I spent 1200 bucks on building
that grow, that means that if I spend,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I make enough herb for four months
worth of herb that I've paid off all my
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, everything after that,
I'm just kind of paying for electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: and water and my energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know, like I've paid off the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maybe I can upgrade to a new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it really will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start seeing like what you're
putting in and what you're getting out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you'll want to improve at that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that the expense report
is just part of the basic grow journaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking a lot of details and
taking notes, that expense report will
[SPEAKER_00]: fall right in line with the rest of your
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just another page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's another part of the
spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once you get comfortable and used
to it, it'll just be another part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation which you are keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I think is important is
to have goals and plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that expense sheet,
it will help you set goals and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you make plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know you're reaching any goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know you're successful if you
never wrote down any goals and made any
[SPEAKER_00]: plans?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to grow some weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a harvest, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you know that the next harvest
is better?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know that the next one is
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have some plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to plant this many seeds at this
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put them into small pots this
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to go into bigger pots
this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I intend to flower on this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave yourself some openings, some
windows, like maybe the plants don't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: as fast as you need it or maybe they grow
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to have an idea, a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing so long that when we go
to a commercial grow, I can look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: height, I can look at the space and I can
say here is the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need nine weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that nine weeks in the flower
room, that's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got to flower nine weeks in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big can I get them by the time they're
done?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big do I have to get them in here
before I flower them to max them out at
[SPEAKER_00]: their maximum height in this room before
we're done?
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me how many weeks we can veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just automatically start thinking two
weeks in the cloner, two weeks in small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, three weeks in big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move them into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just start scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a plan and then we stick to those
plans and schedules and create routines
[SPEAKER_00]: and rhythms and standard operating
procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do that is to have some goals
and have some plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're working with multiple
people, it is really important to get all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those people on the same plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everybody knows the goal and
make sure everybody knows they're part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the puzzle to reach that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody thinks they're a trimmer,
nobody's going to water plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody thinks they're watering
plants, nobody's going to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everybody knows their role.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to do that is to find
somebody that can be the leader that knows
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that needs to be done that can
delegate all of the jobs for an expense
[SPEAKER_00]: sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, in that grow,
have a bunch of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just gave you a bunch of tasks,
a bunch of assignments, a bunch of shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, go in there and have
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's easier to have fun when
we set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm trying to help you do
here is set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go in that grow and all of the
equipment works smoothly, everything just
[SPEAKER_00]: runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push that button and all the processes
happen and the plants go shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be encouraged to be in there more
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll want to grow, grow more,
which means you'll be touching the things
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be learning, which means you'll
want to grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just trigger more inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little work into it and watch how
much it inspires you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that you can accomplish small
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll want to hit bigger goals every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that concludes my first of the
month garden checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I taught you some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I inspired you to do some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're typing out this list as we
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to listen a couple
more times and keep up because I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going quite quickly for this
