[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my next order of business is to
send a big thank you to everybody who sent
[SPEAKER_00]: me positive feedback and constructive
criticism on the previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the previous episode was about
germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get a long lot of comments,
a lot of messages, and a lot of feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: about that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did start that podcast off by saying
that that was how I germinate my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly how I start my seeds for
my personal grow or for a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have great success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people told me that they do it quite
differently, and that is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problems, no complaints,
no issues with you germinating seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: however works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite parts about
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of methods, techniques,
and styles, and they all work if they
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are doing it correctly if you are
satisfied with your outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people wanted to give me
feedback and input on how to germinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those methods and techniques and
tactics will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great ideas and some of
the messages I got, but I was just telling
[SPEAKER_00]: you how I do it, and if you do it
differently, do it your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me sway you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me change your ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to go over some of the ideas and
things that people did mention that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: not talk about on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people are germinating seeds,
a lot of the time they will soak their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for 12 to 24 hours in water before
even putting them in the paper towel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you've got seeds that have a
thicker shell or a thicker hole or grew
[SPEAKER_00]: for too long, that will help them
germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will soften up the seed before you
stick it in the paper towel and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people will do a 12 to 24 hour
soak on their seeds before they do
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just filling up a container,
maybe a shot glass, maybe a beer glass
[SPEAKER_00]: with water, just dropping the seeds right
in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them swim around for 24 hours,
then do the germination method,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people do add peroxide to
that mix when they're doing the soak and
[SPEAKER_00]: the germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put a few drops of hydrogen
peroxide in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their idea is to get rid of any problems,
any bacteria, any problem that may be on
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other growers will add microbes
and add things to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do peroxide or add microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever way works for you, do it because
I have seen great success with both
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you saw in my germination lesson,
I do not use any hydrogen peroxide in my
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do not do the 12 to 24 hour soak
for my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that and it works for you,
keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that a lot of growers will
do, a moment ago I mentioned soaking our
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to soften the shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some seeds grow, if they are
grown for too long and not harvested on
[SPEAKER_00]: time, the shells will become thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will get too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will take something and
scuff the outer layer of that seed shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of different methods for
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will simply get a fine grain
sandpaper and just rub the seed just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to penetrate or puncture or
break open the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to scuff that outer layer to
make it a little bit softer so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture can penetrate that seed and give
it the indicator to pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing that people do
that I honestly do not do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if the seeds were really old or
something like that, I would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of old seeds, I do not do the
peroxide method because I like to promote
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria and fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm starting some older seeds that I
know have been sitting around,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if I got them from somebody and I don't
know the health of those seeds or the age
[SPEAKER_00]: of those seeds, I may treat them with a
microbial product during germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like herb or some kind of
microbes just to give them a head start
[SPEAKER_00]: may be the case for older seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most cases, I don't do any fancy
tricks or techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly just fold up the paper towel,
wet it, and get the seeds going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is not how you do it, that is
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your method works for you, keep doing
your method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not disrespect or doubt your method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just telling you how I do things and
what works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's no one way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the plants are successful and
you're happy with it, you are doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one comment and one piece of feedback
I was getting from a lot of growers is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they do not even bother doing the
soak and the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put their seeds straight into their
dirt, straight into their cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They begin watering and they start their
seeds right in the pot in which the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, if that works for you,
that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few reasons why I don't start
my seeds directly in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, as a breeder, as the person
making the seeds, I like to observe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pay attention to, I can put a
handful of seeds in the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can open it up every however many hours
I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see that it's six hours,
two of them popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 12 hours, four of them popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 18 hours, I've got six of them popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that in 24 hours this many
popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me, I can see them better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're in the soil and the dirt,
I can't monitor them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a breeder who's making the seeds,
I like to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see the growth, the development,
the time and the speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I took a quick drink and fixed
my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a couple of more reasons
why I do not pop my seeds directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil in my container.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, seed direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once my seed is germinated and I've got a
little tail coming out, I know which
[SPEAKER_00]: direction that seed is going to be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which way is up and which way is
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can set that seed in the dirt or in the
cocoa and have it set perfectly the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is set up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just throw it right into the dirt and
I don't give it any direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which direction it's facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to pop the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root may go up as it pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to reorientate itself and go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed needs to figure out which way is
down and which way is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's slowing me down, wasting time and
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put it in there going up and down,
it's already set up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already knows which way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can save a little struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason why I don't like to plant
the seeds directly into the cocoa or into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt is because I like to have better
control of the moisture level in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of my seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I put that seedling in a
baggie, in a paper towel, that moisture is
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a busy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will go to a grow thinking I
need to be at the grow for an hour and I
[SPEAKER_00]: will be gone for six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I wasn't prepared with my plants
properly, I would come home and we would
[SPEAKER_00]: have dry dead seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to set myself up for success,
I put them in the baggie where I can
[SPEAKER_00]: retain that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco dries, soil dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's air movement in the room,
if there's wind, if there's a temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: change, that stuff will dry out more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I can control and predict the
drying rate of that sealed baggie with the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel and the moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I continue to keep that baggie
sealed with the wet paper towel,
[SPEAKER_00]: that moisture is not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I keep that in a warm place,
that seed will germinate and they will be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is part of why I don't go straight
to the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we give ourselves a lot of
opportunity to over or underwater our
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings when we go straight to the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cause them a lot of unnecessary
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a moistened container,
a moistened bed of soil and drop the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: directly into there once it's germinated,
I feel like I'm just setting myself up for
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pride myself on making my seeds
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have very competitive prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice we are a little bit lower
price than a lot of the other brands on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how expensive seeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that every single seed
germinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy seeds from other breeders and other
vendors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay for those seeds just like you guys
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want success just like you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do everything that I can to ensure
that success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quick update on germinating
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of other options of things you
can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things you might not do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I don't do, but things that
are available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off with a 12 to 24 hour soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also added a little bit of peroxide to
that water to get rid of any pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also done a little bit of scuffing
on our seeds to open up the shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people may be planting
directly into their medium, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to do that and it works,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, that's one of the best parts
of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are happy with the outcome,
as long as you're getting the results you
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking for, you can do it however you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that garden your Zen space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it however you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm just trying to share my
knowledge, my info, and the ways that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had the best success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this does segue me into a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Patreon question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Maverick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically says, I started a 10 pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did receive three bonus seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I popped the seeds in order to do
a pheno hunt for some proper smoke and a
[SPEAKER_00]: possible breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like where this is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I started the seeds in a cup of
distilled water, pHed at 6.0 for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're off to a good start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, then into a paper towel for
another 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, eight seeds have germinated
and a few have tailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the tube of the pen and there's
that little just the writing part where it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to taper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like about the right depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is knuckle deep if you compare that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I lightly covered and moistened
with a few drops of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered the cups with clear beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like most of this so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I would have done
differently I think at this point is I
[SPEAKER_00]: would not have covered the cups with beer
cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I talked about that in the
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want those seedlings to get air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to get, maybe even put a fan
on them so they get blown around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we cover clones is to keep the
moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to cover the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creating a root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where they're going to eat and
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we create the humidity
environment is because clones don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, the cup on top is
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if it is working for you,
don't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of growing cannabis in
our own gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says three days later, I have two that
have sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some that have popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day four, I get another sprout and I
lightly water sprouts and add a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: drops to the empty cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's starting to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding some water as they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day eight, I have a total of six
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got six out of either 10 or 13
that you germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a pack of 10, got 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you've got six total
seedlings, which is 50%, which honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the breeder, I would hope for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You paid for those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that you get more than 50%
success out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, upon some excavation,
I found twisted taproots and unsprung
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that just kind of crunched and
mushed at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the question here is, did I do
something wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure the pointy end was down and
all the taproots were down as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: From looking at the picture, my first
instinct is that this plant has been too
[SPEAKER_00]: wet for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says you've only been giving it a
little bit of water, but it looks too wet
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedling itself looks a little
damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just been abused by water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's been sitting in water for too
long and it honestly is getting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you look at one section,
I see what I think is the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: taproot popping back up out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it completely made a loop
and it is coming back up out of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm not sure why that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the seedling wasn't pointing the
right direction, but something caused that
[SPEAKER_00]: taproot to pop right back up out of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look carefully, I think that's what
I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will circle that part in the video so
that we can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really do think that that is the end
of the taproot popping back up out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has curled on itself somehow,
which tells me a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that tells me that it could be too
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think it may be too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to judge heat and cold by
photos, but by looking at this soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that clump of dirt has been that wet
for too long, there is an extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably too cold or too warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too cold, it is definitely going
to slow down all progress of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too hot, it is going to speed up
the rot and the mildew process for that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell the temperature by looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few notes here, but those
notes of the temperature are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the ambient air temp in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the temperature of the soil
inside that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be really cold, especially if
it's sitting on a cold floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be too cold and too wet,
which would be detrimental to a young
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I think about is how
tightly is that soil packed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that soil stuffed in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it kind of fluffy in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too tight, that seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: has been struggling to grow much is in the
entire container.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the perlite does float.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to tell how much is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there airspace in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some airspace?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when roots do start to grow,
are you not going to suffocate that little
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to know is are there
drainage holes in that cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer cups do not come with holes in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't say that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also didn't say that you did not
put any drainage holes in that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that water going anywhere or is it just
evaporating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it making a mud hole inside that
cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you're an experienced
grower, I hope you did put the holes in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something you overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you didn't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any drainage in that container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it does, again, look like it's
been too wet and or too cold for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the details from the letter and
the photo that I've got, I think my
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis is that this plant has been too
wet for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possibly cold as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the solution would be to water
less often and possibly water less water
[SPEAKER_00]: each watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, make sure that you do have
proper draining in that container because
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like there's a lot of water in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does look like it's been soaked for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seedling just has that like wrinkled,
pruney, been in the bathtub too long vibe
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me think too wet,
too cold, too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do have one more completely logical
and rational reason for why your seeds may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not be your problem or your fault
or your issue at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds simply could be duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds simply could be old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those simply could be non viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds did come from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do pride myself on having quality
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do thoroughly test everything before we
release anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not had a lot of negative feedback
about the line you were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes seeds do pass through that
are not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously can't test every single seed
because I've got to send some to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a customer service issue
possibly on my end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like these seeds didn't
germinate because of my fault to no fault
[SPEAKER_00]: of your own, please send me an email and I
would love to send you a replacement pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe those were sitting around at a
vendor for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just got the random unviable
seeds out of that whole batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there were six seeds in there that
weren't good and you happen to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I would be happy to send you a
replacement pack of seeds that I know are
[SPEAKER_00]: more fresh and are quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do feel free to reach out,
send me a follow up and we will get you a
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do look forward to that
germination report and that grow report as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, to wrap this up,
I do think that those seeds were too wet
[SPEAKER_00]: for too long is my diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it could have been a breeder
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you feel like you were owed some
seeds, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be honored and excited to send you
a replacement pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
