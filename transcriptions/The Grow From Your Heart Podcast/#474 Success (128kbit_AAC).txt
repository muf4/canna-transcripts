[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, it is time for episode 474 of
the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of lysergic,
lemon, full spectrum extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of lemon, sour double,
and sour animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the container, the flavor is described
as lemon, meringue, cleaner, and funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I straight up agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a dominant lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is definitely that cleaner kind of a
flavor, and it is definitely funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious, lysergic,
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
in this episode, I'm going to do a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: rant about setting yourself up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have time, I may read a quick email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a shout out
to some of our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your

[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
a big Viking handshake and a Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast shout out to our buddy

[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to become
a patron will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump into the main part of the
show, I want to spend a couple of seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what I got to do a few
nights ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the show regularly,
you know that I am a giant comedy fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few nights ago, one of my favorite
comedians on the planet came to Denver and
[SPEAKER_00]: I took my buddy Clint up to Denver and we
got to go see Joey Coco Diaz and he blew
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof off of the Paramount Theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey is a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are into comedy, if you have been
paying attention to Joey Diaz,
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey is at the top of his game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to go see Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already listening to the
Church of What's Happening Now podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: now is the time to subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Joey Coco fucking Diaz is on a brand
new level of comedy, which I have never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're into comedy, if you're into
podcasting, and if you're into Joey Diaz,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you go see Joey while
he is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not already into Joey,
now is the time to discover him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also give a big shout out to
Felicia Michaels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felicia opened for Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been friends for about a hundred
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to do a podcast together called
The Beauty and the Beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Felicia was the beauty and Joey
was the beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get to learn a lot about Joey
Diaz from that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into comedy, if you're into
dirty comedy and you like storytellers,
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey Diaz is somebody you need to learn
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Felicia Michaels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a big shout out to my buddy
Clint for always being a fucking perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go and see comedy shows together and he
is drama free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Clint for being a
great comedy road dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also owe a big shout out to my
friend Daniel, who came up and said hello
[SPEAKER_00]: to me at the theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Daniel?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you and your brother are doing
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry we didn't get to hang out after
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I had to get back to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a great night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to send a giant shout out to
everybody at the Paramount Theater for
[SPEAKER_00]: making everybody feel like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treated us beautifully well in that
club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really great time and I cannot
wait to go back for another show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, that is enough talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough bragging.
[SPEAKER_00]: About all of the fun that I get to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move this podcast forward and talk
about growing or talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually talk about setting yourself
up to grow successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people on the Internet
setting themselves up for failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people in Facebook groups
and other online platforms setting
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves up to fall directly on their
faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people trying to take shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people taking shitty advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people buying shitty equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cheap nutrients and shitty genetics in
an attempt to save a few dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every shortcut you take at the beginning
of your grow is going to cost you money at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the grow and potentially cause
you problems throughout the grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about setting ourselves up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when I talk about building
a grow or setting up a grow space in
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's home, a lot of people say,
well, can't I just do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, you could just do that,
but you're going to harvest just some
[SPEAKER_00]: mediocre product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it the right way and you spend a
couple of bucks and take some time and put
[SPEAKER_00]: some effort into it and do some research,
you can harvest a beautiful crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just do it the shit way,
you will just harvest some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's set ourselves up for success from
the beginning, from day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by setting yourself up for success,
I mean do some research, study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be Pablo Escobar or are you
trying to grow some weeds so you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pay for it anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got a realistic goal,
find a space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy the appropriate equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set that equipment up correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't set up equipment thinking that
you're going to be home every day and you
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to personally plug in and unplug
that light every day at six o'clock
[SPEAKER_00]: because I promise you, 21 days in,
you're going to fall out of the habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get bored with it and
you're going to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to ruin the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend the $19.99 and get a fucking timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do everything the shit cheap way
because it's the shit cheap way and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a couple of bucks, put some energy
into it and respect the fucking plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were trying to grow and those
plants will respect you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give the plants a shit environment,
a shit schedule, shit nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit love and care, guess what they're
going to give you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get shit right back from
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you put into your cannabis
plants comes back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it comes back threefold,
sometimes five, maybe seven, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these plants are very karmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we put in will come back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put in love, if you put in time and
you put in energy, guess what you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love, care and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all you invest in your grow room is
bullshit and stress, all you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of that grow room is bullshit and
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do everything we can to set
ourselves up for success from the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan, have a space, have the
appropriate equipment, have some knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants, know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let things be such a surprise in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hockey player would go to a hockey game
without his hockey helmet and his skates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is setting yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show up for the hockey game without
your skates and your helmet, you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: sit on the bench and you've already
fucking failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've led to your entire team failing
and you're a big loser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you've got the appropriate
equipment, don't cheap out on equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, I can just buy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you could just buy that or you
could spend some money and get a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: light and actually make your grow worth
the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get quality equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I highly recommend quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how good all of your equipment
is, the potential of your garden is mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: limited by the potential of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing plants that do not have
the potential to reach the goal you
[SPEAKER_00]: desire, you will never reach your goal no
matter what you put into those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend you start with either good
seeds or good clones and set yourself up
[SPEAKER_00]: for success when you get those seeds or
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to start from seed,
I highly recommend that those seeds come
[SPEAKER_00]: from a reputable breeder and that you get
those seeds from a reputable seed vendor
[SPEAKER_00]: if not from the breeder directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get clones, I recommend you get
clones from somebody you trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you trust that person with
your life, I still recommend you treat
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones like they have got every pest
imaginable attached to them when they are
[SPEAKER_00]: given to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any clone you get is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice safe clone sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any clone you get has an STD and we need
to get rid of that STD before we put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the population with our other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these are the first clones you're
bringing in, you need to clean them up so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you start with a clean grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just spent a bunch of money building a
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to contaminate that with our
first batch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in another area under a small
light for a night or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them down with a few products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them however you feel they need to
be treated so they will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspect them two or three times and make
sure there are no living pests on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before you put them into general
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a step to setting yourself up for
success here is having the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides on hand before you go get your
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The appropriate steps for setting yourself
up for success here are understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: which pesticides you want to use before
you go to the store to buy those
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides for your new clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of preparation to be done
for a successful cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you've got your clones into your
grow environment, you're going to run into
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: No grow is going to go 100% smoothly and
if it does, you probably don't learn much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is one more thing about setting
yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do run into problems,
do not go to Facebook groups and ask a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of questions and rely on everybody
in that group to have a reasonable answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of the grow information, the tips and
advice that I see on social media are
[SPEAKER_00]: complete bullshit and will end up causing
you more problems than they would if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just left the original problem alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that will really help you set
yourself up for success is learning to
[SPEAKER_00]: filter out the bullshit on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 10 people are going to give you
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get really good at filtering
out the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to do that is to get a
cannabis specific grow book written by an
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced author who grows and writes
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several great books and several
great authors out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Ed Rosenthal and the
Jorge Cervantes books for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those books are a little bit dated
and some of the information is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit old, but you can get a great knowledge
base from those books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also suggest that you supplement
your cannabis education with quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this show,
you're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me also suggest the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you really want to go deeper into
cannabis education, let me recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire with Shango Los and the
Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: with Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many great resources for
expanding your cannabis knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: but none of this information is going to
be delivered to your lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do a little bit of work to go
find the knowledge you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said earlier, most of that
knowledge you find on social media is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause more problems than it will
actually correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend that you learn
through books and through podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through educated cannabis cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some very qualified,
very educated, very knowledgeable cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts online, but it is very
challenging sorting through the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do choose to take your cannabis
information from online sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: please be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some cross-referencing, do some
checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever feel bad to ask somebody why.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody says that plant needs Epsom
salt, you can say, why do you feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: way?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they cannot tell you why that plant
needs Epsom salt, they probably don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that that plant needs Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, people say that plant
needs this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, why does it need that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, well, my plant looked like
yours and my friend told me to try that
[SPEAKER_00]: and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no basis behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, my buddy did it and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you should try it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that may work for you,
but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what was going on in that
guy's grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what was going on in his
buddy's grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know what's going on in your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could all be three completely
different problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it worked for two guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours may look similar, but it is a
completely different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solution that guy gave you could
really double and compound the original
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to know that we are correctly
diagnosing a problem before we try
[SPEAKER_00]: correcting anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful, be very discerning
with the information you get from the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really suggest you get most of your
information from books and podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like about books is they are
visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can open up a page and see a picture of
a leaf with a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of a spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really like about podcasting is you
can learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be listening to me while you're
in the car right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be driving to work and getting a
free cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be working in a grow with your
hands on plants and learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what I enjoy about
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, most podcasters are knowledgeable
enough to follow their advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like most people who have gotten
far enough to set up a podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicate time and create an RSS feed and
create an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those people should be qualified
to give out useful cannabis advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we have to be careful with
every piece of information we are given
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes we have just enough
knowledge to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one more thing I really want to make
sure I mention while we are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: setting ourselves up for success is
keeping a journal and taking notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: having a calendar and a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start a schedule before your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you going to veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are you going to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start flowering at this day,
when will the plants be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are done at that day,
when do you need to start flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start flowering on this day,
when should I defoliate?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I pop and twist?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I put on the first net?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I start adding bloom boosters
to my nutrient feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I start reducing nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a calendar on the wall on
the inside or outside of your grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: that says, hey, on this day, I should
probably defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this day, I need to put up another net.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this day, begin flushing because on
this day we harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will save you so much headache in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants start looking ripe,
you won't have to go, well, how long have
[SPEAKER_00]: they been in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I start flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have decided that before you
even put the plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an eight week cultivar,
write down day one, week one, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Count down eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six weeks in, start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut that shit down at the end of eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be that challenging if you
have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are running nine or 10 week
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick nine weeks, 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means at the end of day 50,
start flushing, write it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention, set yourself up for
success, and you will eliminate so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the problems that we keep running into in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my throat is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take about 72 dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big fat drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to come back and I'm going
to read a listener email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab while I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated and heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of fat dabs of some secret
Kush Mints live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of secret cookie and Kush
Mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, they describe the flavor
as oatmeal, raisin, and sugar cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it tastes like a little Debbie
oatmeal cream pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a really weird description,
but it's got that oatmeal flavor to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then there is something kind of sweet,
kind of like the frosting part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the secret Kush Mints live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one kind of makes me sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is like the put you on your ass,
sit you back in your chair, concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I thought was weird is I
took two dabs and now I am freezing cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually not real cold after a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is like 68 degrees in this
house right now, so that could have
[SPEAKER_00]: something to do with it, but I just took a
fat dab and now I'm real cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to record a shivery podcast
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that I was going to read an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I will warm up as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a good one to answer on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had shitty luck with cloning this
girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a bunch of my cuts of my HW
fruit punch before flipping it over into
[SPEAKER_00]: flour and they did not make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my heat was not dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could likely be the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, well, I went ahead and
grabbed a couple more clones and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: them outside in the shade in this hot ass
part of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are, but I wish I
was there because it is cold as shit here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Southern Colorado today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says these clones have already lasted
longer, but not yet rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're outdoors and they're living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what type of environment
you've got them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're in a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're in plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're straight into the
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confused, but it goes on to say these
seem to take a while anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is when I checked the
plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we've got plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a couple of tiny bugs crawling on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very likely to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got cannabis plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a nice warm climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving them water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating the perfect environment
for some buggies to come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have seen it says when I
checked the plugs, I saw a couple of tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs crawling on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are definitely not setting yourself up
for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have already got struggle plants here,
but there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if these do indeed make it,
what would you suggest I do to treat these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before I bring them inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally would not bring plants from
outdoors to the indoors, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: already knowing for sure that you have got
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've got a pre-plant area like a
quarantine, like an entry or an intake
[SPEAKER_00]: area that is not your main grow,
I would not bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know there are bugs on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already starting with the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants already need special
attention and special treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we need to do is identify
the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any sort of pest prevention or
eradication method, you have to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest or the potential pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure out what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that bug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need to think about strategies to
eliminate that specific pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Battling those pests outdoors will be a
real challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you need to consider
bringing those clones indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it starts getting risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're bringing contaminated plants
into your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've got that pre-area or a
quarantined area or a little intake area,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a holding cell or a triage,
unless you've got something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: where these plants that are being treated
can be held, I would not recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing them into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to bring in bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are bugs on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming in with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stop that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you do put them in a quarantined
room, you're probably going to take those
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs into your main population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless these clones are hypercritical,
I would not recommend this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist on bringing these clones in,
I would do a drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would first identify the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would identify the appropriate
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would read research thoroughly and
see if those plants will survive a drench
[SPEAKER_00]: with that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to mix up a container,
however big you need to fit that plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be fully submerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a one gallon, maybe a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big your plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that up appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a wetting agent in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then dunk that plant thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear a rubber glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe wear like a long arm glove if you're
going to go deep into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear a glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swish that plant around in there for a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the bugs float up off the top of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to float to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the bugs try to swim away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting pesticide and water on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure what type of pesticide you
are going to choose to use for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to dunk your plant into clean
water and rinse that pesticide off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pesticides you choose to use
may cause phytotoxicity, which means when
[SPEAKER_00]: we turn the lights back on, that light is
going to react with the chemical in that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, probably an oil, and it will create
a reaction that will destroy your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research the appropriate pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you can do a dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if a rinse is recommended after that
dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe test your pesticide application on
one or two plants before you destroy the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the first step is identify the
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second step is to find the appropriate
solution for that pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then treat carefully, treat accordingly,
and maybe try with just a couple of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in case your strategy causes severe
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how important these clones
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much money you want to
spend on pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much time you want to
spend trying to battle these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be very careful not to get those bugs
into your general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I would bring them into a
quarantined area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get rid of the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them for multiple days, multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe use multiple different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs develop a resistance to specific
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray the same thing too many
times, by the fourth or fifth time,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just going to open up and drink
it, and they're going to turn into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible Hulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to breed more impressive,
more destructive bugs in further
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to make them stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that a bug will never build a
resistance to is being eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predator bugs are always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using predator bugs in your main
grow area, order extras, take those to
[SPEAKER_00]: your quarantined area, overload that new
plant with predator bugs, and watch those
[SPEAKER_00]: bad bitches eat those undesirable pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer is, kill it with fire,
the clones and the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't bring them from outdoors to
indoors, but I don't know how critical
[SPEAKER_00]: they are to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identify the bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find either the correct pesticide or the
correct predator for that bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then treat carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't treat the entire population at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe see if you might kill the plants
with the pesticides you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're not going to destroy
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then continue once you've done a little
bit of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I wouldn't bring them in unless
you absolutely need these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're absolutely in love with
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not setting yourself up for
success by bringing problematic clones
[SPEAKER_00]: into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
