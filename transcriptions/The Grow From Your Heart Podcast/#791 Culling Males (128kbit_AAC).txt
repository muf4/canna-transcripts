[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 791 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm going to give away a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've teamed up with our friends at seeds
here now.com to give away a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: irie genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about that later in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to remind
you that I will be at the dude grows cup
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, June 3, we are doing the
dude grows cup in Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all
the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to send a big thank you shout
out to everybody who participated in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sale on irie direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a big sale over the past week.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people got a lot of great deals,
a lot of great orders and it took me a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of time to get all those
packages out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the orders have been sent by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have a tracking number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the orders have landed by the time
this episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to stay informed, stay up to
date, know about the next sale,
[SPEAKER_01]: the next drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easiest way to do it is to join the
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to irie genetics.com or irie
direct.com and you scroll down toward the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the page, there's a tab where it
says stay in touch or stay updated with
[SPEAKER_01]: irie genetics, type in your email address,
hit return.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will add you to my newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I knew it, when I do a new drop,
when I do updates, when I add new
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory, of course you will be notified
of that stuff on irie direct via the
[SPEAKER_01]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the people on Patreon do get first
dibs when I do a sale, the higher the
[SPEAKER_01]: tier, the better the heads up you're going
to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the better coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time they got the first heads up that
deals were coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they also got free shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe join the Patreon, definitely join
the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if nothing else, do of course join the
discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: The discord is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: The newsletter is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do encourage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to announce that we've done
some changes on irie direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this episode comes out,
all the web updates will have been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now got a tiered giveaway system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more seeds you buy, the more
freebies you will get.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make it very clear and it's indicated
on your shopping cart which freebies come
[SPEAKER_01]: with your orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spend this much, you will get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spend this much, I'll give you this
and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those do stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, if you spend 100, you get the
freebie for 30 and the freebie for 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spend 200, I think you get a
freebie at 25, 100, 150 and 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a $250 tier also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spend $250 on irie direct at this
time, you actually get a freebie free 10
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of big mountain fudge cake along with
a few other freebies that will come with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my ramble on the updates on
irie direct.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you join the Patreon,
sign up for the newsletter, check out the
[SPEAKER_01]: discord and then also look for the new
freebies on irie direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a lot to ask for from you
right here at the start of the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work my way into the email portion
of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of great emails here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they want their names set on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure they want their whole name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want high off kebabs to be their name
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to high off kebabs,
high off kebabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, let me give you a big
congratulations because in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: episode I said that if I read your message
from the grow question submissions tab on
[SPEAKER_01]: the website, if you send a question there
and I do read that that you will win a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high off kebabs send me your address
because I do owe you a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that free seed giveaway is
sponsored by seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the crew at seeds here now
dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend high off kebabs did send a
grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Rasta Jeff bless your soul
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many blessings back at you brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I picked up the blueberry butcher
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've planted all 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you're about to have a party,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for grabbing the blueberry
butchers says they are in the vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are bushy and some are taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that amongst the population
that is very common, especially amongst
[SPEAKER_01]: the F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filial generation says they are 10 to 24
average 24 inches tall on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take clones from each one and
then flip them to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend that take a clone from
everything before you flower it because
[SPEAKER_01]: you may have the most amazing cannabis
you've ever grown there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be your favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be the plant that does the thing
you need done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have a clone of it,
it'd be really heartbreaking to know that
[SPEAKER_01]: that jar will be empty someday and you
can't reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always take a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my preaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says how would I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, how would I control the males
from not throwing pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long would it take for a novice grower
to realize the males?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a little bit more details
we'll talk about later on in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk very in depth about this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basically about doing cutting
clones to do some sexing and not
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminating the rest of the girl with
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you've got a good idea
of what you were doing already and you
[SPEAKER_01]: were already onto a good path of being
successful with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are 10 to 24 inches tall on
average, which means by the time this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode comes out, it will be time to get
clones from these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very simply grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got them in your pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got them under lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to keep producing branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend taking three clones from
each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be 30 cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If legally and everything is that's
possible for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend taking three clones from each
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be one really healthy
clone at the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That main top, I would make that the
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always my favorite clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I always clean up the bottom branches
off of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a couple of good healthy
branches there on the bottom, make two
[SPEAKER_01]: clones out of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got three clones from every
plant I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make clones in an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make clones in the little root riot
plugs with the dome over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty proficient at making clones in
just about any style that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when I do clone making videos,
you YouTube doesn't like it and they take
[SPEAKER_01]: them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can tell you briefly how I do clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wait till the plants are nice and
healthy and then I cut them at a 45 degree
[SPEAKER_01]: angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dip it in a, I use the, the clone X gel,
the purple stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that, wear gloves when you use that
always cut it at a 45 degree angle,
[SPEAKER_01]: dip it in the clone X.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're going into an easy
cloner, all you got to do is put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: collar and then make sure the water in the
easy cloner is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a EC of 1.1 with the easy cloner,
the clone X, the liquid solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow one, and then I will adjust the
pH to about six, one, six, two,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I will set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if, uh, I know it's in a warm
room, sometimes I'll add some of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, what's the product that prevents the
algae from growing in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't even think of the name clear res.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew when I gave up, it would popped
into my head, add some clear res in there
[SPEAKER_01]: once every five to seven days ish and just
let it rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe add some water in there a few
days later and that cloner should rock for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, or clip it, dip it, and then stick it
into the, uh, rapid router.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I feed those rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray them actually to keep them nice and
wet, but not too soggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, put this, uh, the cloning solution,
the same solution, 1.1, uh, clone X at a
[SPEAKER_01]: pH of about 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake it up real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray the, the root riot plugs or the
rapid router plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, so get those nice and
appropriately wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spray them with the spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I dip the clone in the clone X
solution and pop it right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprayed the underside of the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's wet inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I put that dome right on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, all of the vents are
covered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put it under a light to get a
lot of humidity happening in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably won't touch that for five
to seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then I'll slowly start popping it open
for a little bit of time, slowly open the
[SPEAKER_01]: vents and increase my open interval until
I can get them into their forever homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, that is a quickie on how to do
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are full episodes on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, YouTube keeps taking mine down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to YouTube for that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so get your plants, grow them till
they're big enough to get a clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: get three clones from each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I like to wait, since you're kind of
new, I would wait until those clones begin
[SPEAKER_01]: to show roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you know that you've got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got three opportunities for each
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you see roots popping out of,
however you're doing the clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's out of the bottom of the easy
corner or popping out of the, the rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: rooters, then I would put the main big
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can move the big plants into
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to stress about having a
preservation or a backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also if they don't, you've still got a
few days to take clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also the option for revenge,
but I digress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we've got our clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put the big plants under
1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in about 12 days, you should be able
to identify the males and the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be a little bit earlier,
but generally 10 to 14 days is how long it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes for a cannabis plant to show you if
it's a male or a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will depend on several things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will depend on how far end of veg
this plant has been going.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long has it been in that pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, how root bound is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How tall is the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, some plants like to show you that
they're male way earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than some other plants like to show you
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just may be a real eager candidate
to show you that's a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this will depend on your lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much lighting have you been giving
these plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're getting a lot of light,
it may show you a little bit more early.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they haven't been getting a lot of
light, it may take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one thing to keep in mind that I
noticed those plants, they get real
[SPEAKER_01]: stretchy right away and grow right above
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times those are male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get, don't get too excited about the
taller plants in the garden when you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg, because oftentimes those are the
boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get above all the girls so
that when they get taller, when it's time
[SPEAKER_01]: to flower, they can put pollen out and the
pollen will fall down onto the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the boys try to get taller,
get above everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their whole intention of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back to the notes, back to the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that way we can help you out a little
bit more accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is how would I control males
from not throwing pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're probably not going to dump
pollen somewhere until about day 14 to 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe right in that area about day 17 is
probably when you're going to get pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to show you that they're
males about day 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a four day, seven day period
of when you're not going to have any
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pull them out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just, uh, the male plants don't
just pop up and go poof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ejecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you've got to look at books and
establish, first of all, learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify males and females.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should have been, uh, I should have
done that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have guided you to do that part way
earlier in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to identify males and females.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be in every cannabis book.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be all over the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done an episode on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, learn how to identify males and
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will start popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males will start popping up little
nubs and that little nub will start to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a little, uh, little branch on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on that branch will form a little
ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then more balls will form and then more
balls will form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually those balls will start to
open up and pollen will come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get plenty of warning that that is a
male plant before the pollen form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the way to prevent the,
uh, pollen from coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, probably 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've still got, if you do it quickly
enough, you will not get any pollen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go in there and do a visual
inspection of every single plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Push all the plants into a group on one
side of the room and then move them back
[SPEAKER_01]: over into their spot to the left side of
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you look at them, not a, not a male,
move it over, not a male, move it over,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a male, move it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put them into flower and pay attention
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your other option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another option is you can get a lab sex
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order a lab sex testing kit from
farmer Freeman or other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our buddy, farmer
Freeman, uh, does not pay me to support
[SPEAKER_01]: him, but he's just a good, got a good
product, does good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, they will send you a sex testing
sample kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll take a little sample of your leaf
and rub it on a little card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how farmer Freeman does it,
but you just take a leaf, rub it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: card, fold that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mark that plant number seven or
whatever it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mark that card number seven
or whatever it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send all of your cards to the testing
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They send you an email that says plant one
is a boy plant two was a girl plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant three is a boy plant four is a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let you have a breakdown of every
plant that is male and female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you can use that lab testing,
or you can use your visual eyes to go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead and identify male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do identify the males,
if it's through a lab report, or if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: through your own visual identification,
go ahead and cut down that male plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but wait till you're sure, because a lot
of people are new and they see some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: happening and they think that the plant is
a male and they cut it down a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're certain that that plant
is a male and then cut it down as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the next step is to go in the
clone room and remove all of the clones
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you cut the clones, make sure they
are clearly labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go in the room, clearly label the
clones when you cut them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came from plant A, plant B,
plant C.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can name them if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give them letters, numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put colored stickers on them as
long as it matches red plant, red clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: purple plant, purple clones, plant number
57, clone number 57.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as that shit matches up in your
code, you could draw hieroglyphics if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want, as long as it matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that I've got to get rid of
the hieroglyphic that looks like an
[SPEAKER_01]: antelope on the big plant and the
hieroglyphic that looks like an antelope
[SPEAKER_01]: on the little plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've identified the males and
females, remove both the big plant and the
[SPEAKER_01]: little plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part of the question is
how long would it take for a novice grower
[SPEAKER_01]: to realize the males?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a little bit of research on the
internet and look at a couple of books and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what a male and a female plant looks
like, it'll be very obvious in about 12
[SPEAKER_01]: days from flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think you'll be able to identify
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't, come to the Discord,
come to the IRIE Army Discord and go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general help tab or anywhere in there
and just post pictures and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, can somebody help me identify if
these are males or females?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will go in there and
they'll give you very useful advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust the people in the IRIE Army.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really, really need help,
tag me and I'll go look at it and I'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: if I can give you solid advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do trust the whole crew in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will give you good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long would it take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side note, I will be going on vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is going to be the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going on vacation March 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I flip to flower, would I have enough
time to see the males and remove them from
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which should be about three weeks or so
from me writing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find out if you got males
or females in about 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would flip now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this episode comes out, it's time to
flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the first week of March
still when this comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead and flip now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my advice to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does talk about the setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to know about the setup
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still sexing the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really quickly, I do have some notes
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says veg them, clone them, make sure
you get good labels, flip the big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you guys, you don't have to flip the
big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will flip the small plants
and then you can find out if those are
[SPEAKER_01]: males or females right away or another way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can just veg them and then re or
flip them into flower and re veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this listener does not have time
for that because he's got to go on
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the clones you need, keep the big
plants you need, and then watch out for
[SPEAKER_01]: the males and call the plants that you
don't need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I covered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I answered your question pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, hi off kebabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we are able to identify your male
and female plants before you do go on
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said, if you need any help,
do send pictures to the iry army discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will do our best to help you out,
but it should be quite obvious which are
[SPEAKER_01]: boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also don't forget, send me another
email with your shipping address and a
[SPEAKER_01]: good name to put on the box because you my
friend did win a free pack of iry genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've got another message here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do get quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from the iry genetics help
tab on iry genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The listener wants to be called ripened
bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a problem in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing wedding cheesecake auto
cross to jawa pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going indoors under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to the main part of the question
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure some of this info pertains to
the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says yo rasta jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering about keeping regular males
and auto to regular f1 males and the veg
[SPEAKER_01]: light cycle to save on hold to eventually
breed with but not for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it's a long sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another breeding project going
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so there's a lot of stuff to
unpack there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular males are going to be one set of
answers in this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto to regulars are going to be another
answer and f1 males just count on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: batch as regular males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think autos could be f1 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just wanted to clear some of that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I have another breeding project
going will the male plants in veg
[SPEAKER_01]: typically not pollinate any females around
or will they sometimes pollinate female
[SPEAKER_01]: plants if they are held held for a long
time in a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the correct term use of the
word stable here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would mostly not pollinate unless in
flower light cycle, but I also wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised if it happens sometimes trying
to hone my skills with stability and best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for all of your awesome
content and info for sharing your
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions and for your desire to help
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the man much love, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by the way, also you did win a free
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading your message here on the show,
which means that you should send me your
[SPEAKER_01]: address as well so that I can send you a
free pack of iri genetic seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: giveaway once again is sponsored by seeds
here now calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to remember to mention our friends at
seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will the male plants typically not
pollinate in a vegetative stage if it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: a true vegetative stage, it will not
pollinate those plants will not pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: like I talked about previously,
they'll need some time to shift into the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower stage, then they'll need time to
start developing pollen sacks,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it'll take a little bit for those
sacks to open, you should be paying
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to the plants, you should be
able to identify that way before that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, these are cannabis plants,
and shit does go haywire sometimes if you
[SPEAKER_01]: get a male plant that is not getting
enough light that becomes root bound,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is just not getting fed enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll go into panic mode and
they will start to flower just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us have female plants that are of
a more tropical variety, a longer
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering varietal sometimes if you don't
give them enough light if they get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit root bound if they get shaded a
little bit, or if you just over or under
[SPEAKER_01]: feed it or if it gets bugs, it may just go
into flower because it's in fucking panic
[SPEAKER_01]: mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what some plants do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your male plant does experience any
stress, any drought, overfeeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: underfeeding, if it's too crowded in,
it may start to stretch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll go Hey, guess what,
you're not treating me right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going into flower and then it'll just
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, yes, it can pollinate
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind also the female plants
can only receive pollen once they've
[SPEAKER_01]: developed pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the male plants will only pollinate
once they've developed these stamens and
[SPEAKER_01]: those have grown out and then exploded a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me catch up read the notes here,
make sure I'm on the right track to
[SPEAKER_01]: answering you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't pollinate unless they make some
pollen, you got to put them into flower or
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got to flower because you've
stress induced that flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then stability, we've talked about
stability, that is more stability means
[SPEAKER_01]: uniformity amongst population more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any plants could express a phenotype
that will make pollen under not perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're stressing the plant,
that could happen with any plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep the room right, keep the male
plant happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't a lot of people just shove the mail
off into the corner and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use him when I need him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treat him like he's the star of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male plant is the fucking king.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plant is called King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the without that male,
the other girls aren't going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he stays right in the middle under the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a King Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the BC Lemon skunk male.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a chocolate male.
[SPEAKER_01]: All just right under their own light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boys get their own little section
because they're just as important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't overlook the importance of taking
care of your male plant of pruning it,
[SPEAKER_01]: lollipopping it, topping it, taking a
couple of backup clones every now and then
[SPEAKER_01]: just in case when I'm in the room cutting
clones, even if I don't need a clone of
[SPEAKER_01]: the boys, I'm going to take a clone off
the bottom branches I clean up just
[SPEAKER_01]: because if some shit goes wrong,
I want to have one in the cloner one in a
[SPEAKER_01]: small pot and then one under the lights
because those are the those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators bro I've took longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent more time selecting the male
plants than I did any of the female plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because I need solid male plants in my
lineup I've talked a lot about that but um
[SPEAKER_01]: give them their space give them the room
the area the care that the male plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that they deserve just like the females
they are all equal in that room um trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to hone my skills and with uh stability
and best practices thank you so much for
[SPEAKER_01]: your awesome content bro thank you for the
great question I hope I answered your your
[SPEAKER_01]: question if you give them proper care
proper light they will not throw any
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen until they go into pollen or there
of course is the option to stress induce
[SPEAKER_01]: some pollen from those male plants all
right dude thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_01]: question again do send me your email
