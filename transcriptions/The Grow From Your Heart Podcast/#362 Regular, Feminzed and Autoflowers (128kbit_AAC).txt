[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 362 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these shows off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of orange,
skittles, ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this as my morning smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording earlier in the morning than
I usually do, and this orange skittles has
[SPEAKER_00]: that orange juice, orange candy sort of a
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got my head going pretty
quickly, so it's a great way to start the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking the orange skittles,
fambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference between the ambrosia
and the fambrosia is the ambrosia is a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they put it in the four-gram jar,
that's when they call it the fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the orange skittles, fambrosia,
the potency says 73.7% THC, zero CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids, 84%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to start the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an uplifting head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that amazing orange candy flavor
to it, and it's got me nice and talkative
[SPEAKER_00]: and energized, so this should be a good
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last lesson, I talked about clones
versus seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this episode, we're going to talk
about regular seeds, feminine seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the seed talk,
I want to give a few shout-outs to a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of our Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout-out to Angel
Burtis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout-out to Miles Porter,
a super shout-out to Jade, and an extra
[SPEAKER_00]: Viking shout-out to Grimble the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for all of the support on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already a patron and you
would like to learn how to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: patron, you can do so by going to patreon
.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com slash grow

[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn how to sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can become a patron, and I will give
you a shout-out on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, this episode is
going to be about regular seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminine seed, and autoflower seed and
deciding what will be best for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there will have an
opinion about feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there will have an
opinion about autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody stop you from growing
what makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why regular seeds exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why feminine seeds exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why autoflower seeds
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are applications for all of those
types of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you love and don't let anybody out
there stop you from growing from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are shopping for seeds,
we are thrown a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is just fluff for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in that information,
we should be able to tell if the seeds we
[SPEAKER_00]: are shopping for are regular, feminized,
or autoflowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be clearly noted somewhere in
the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't see any sort of notation,
I generally assume they are regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a really good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by regular seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: By regular seed, I mean they were produced
conventionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were made with a male plant and a
female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that package of seeds, you will find
males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also not autoflower, which means
they are photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photoperiod means that a plant is
triggered into its flowering stage by a
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, this light cycle is mostly
dictated by your location in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: the occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are on the equator, are you right
on the equator, are you far north,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are you far south of the equator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as the seasons change, as fall rolls
around, regions on the equator will start
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing longer nights and shorter
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those longer nights and shorter days tell
our plant, hey, winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to start producing your flowers
so that you can reproduce before the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that triggers the plant to go into
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is its photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, most cannabis plants require
about a 12-hour dark period to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors can be different because the sun
puts off different spectrums that trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun sets, it puts off a red
spectrum that tells that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, it's nighttime, and then it starts
going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun rises, it puts off a blue
spectrum that tells the plant it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need the 12-12 outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work closer to a 14-hour day and
more of a 10-hour night outdoors because
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun tells the plants to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants work off the light cycle and
the light cycle works with nature
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, we're controlling that with a
timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your seeds are marked regular seeds or
if it says photo on the package,
[SPEAKER_00]: that indicates that those plants will be
triggered to flower by reducing your light
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule to 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, regular seeds also indicates that
there will be males and females in that
[SPEAKER_00]: package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow a seedless crop,
you will have to pick it up, pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention, and keep the males out of the
flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between seven and 10 days,
those plants will start showing their sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to go through and pull out all
of the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave one male plant in there for
too long, it will pollinate and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants around it will be seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how long you let that
male go and how much pollen he released
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much wind flow and how much
movement you have in that grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may seed the entire crop with just one
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were bred conventionally,
traditionally with a male and a female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are photosensitive, which means they
will trigger into flower by reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to approximately 12 hours on and 12
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will work one hour either
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go 13 hours on, you could go 13
hours off, you could play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we recommend 12-12 as the critical
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you will find males and females in
your regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not looking to do any breeding,
if you want to grow seedless cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do need to cull those males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only major downfall of
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a package of regular seeds,
you've got about a 50-50 chance of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to dictate what you get with
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people don't want to waste
the energy, the time, the space or the
[SPEAKER_00]: money buying and growing seeds that could
possibly be males and need to be removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is where feminized seeds come
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have hatred toward
feminized seeds because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have hatred or a bias
against feminized seeds because there were
[SPEAKER_00]: a few breeders back in the day that put
out a batch of feminized seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few people bought those and it put a
bad taste in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people spread that taste
throughout the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand when you get a terrible
product, you want to tell people,
[SPEAKER_00]: people believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have come a long way since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand how to produce feminized
seeds on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of breeders and
producers out there putting out reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: quality feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are made properly, feminized
seeds will produce plants that give you
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.9% females.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nature and science together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find things that don't fall into
the chart that we drew because that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: nature works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we say 99.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do my job correctly, when I produce
feminized seeds, you will get 99.9% female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a brief explanation on how I
make feminized seeds and how a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leading feminized seed producers make
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I create a solution of silver thiosulfate
that is really easy to learn how to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the instructions for that are
readily available on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a silver thiosulfate solution
from products that are easily attainable
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet for less than $30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use product number one and product
number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix them into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I mix the two things of water
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got my silver thiosulfate
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dilute that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant that I'm using requires a
different dilution and application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a standard that I start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic dilution that I recommend to
start with would be a one to nine ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got nine parts water,
one part of the silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate mixed into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake that up real well and apply that to
the plant on the first day of flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: then apply it every three days for 21
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to give the plant seven
full applications and spray it until it
[SPEAKER_00]: drips and get the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just get the leaves, get in there
and spray the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be careful when you're using the
silver thiosulfate spray because it may
[SPEAKER_00]: turn some things purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a white wall, depending on
what you're up against, whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: hits, it could turn it purple,
including your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful, wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear a mask when working with a silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take the silver thiosulfate solution
that I have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix it at a dilution of nine to one,
nine parts distilled water, one part
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I apply it to the plants every three
days for 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets 21 applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then usually around day 25 to 30,
it starts putting out pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I start collecting the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put something, usually a piece of glass
just depends on where I am and what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a piece of glass near the plant,
collect some pollen as it naturally falls
[SPEAKER_00]: out, pick the male flowers out of there,
gather that, let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it really starts getting
dumping, that's when I'll move it right
[SPEAKER_00]: over by the girls and give it a good
shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've just made feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got six or seven weeks of
nourishing those seeds, but if I have done
[SPEAKER_00]: everything carefully and done everything
correctly, I have created feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and there should be no reason why those
should be problematic unless I completely
[SPEAKER_00]: screw up the next six or seven weeks which
is very unlikely because all I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is make sure the equipment functions,
make sure everything stays on a 12-12
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to feed it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to feed plants that are
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to produce quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to defoliate properly and I've
also got to make sure to keep everything
[SPEAKER_00]: pest and problem free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm quite experienced at all of that
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there should be no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also make sure to thoroughly test run
every batch of seeds I make before they
[SPEAKER_00]: make it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow some out myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give a bunch out to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys see on Instagram,
people have the new stuff and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how did they get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they grew something of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to them and I said,
hey, do you want to run my next batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to take good notes,
take good photos, send it all back to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll know if I want to release
that line or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have other people grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We test it before it's put out to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know that you're receiving a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go off way on a side rant
here that's not even written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make a new strain, so let's just
say I just pulled some seeds out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a brand new cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it's going to do before
those seeds go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw a handful of them in a
paper towel and germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 24 hours, I'm going to pop it
open and I'm going to see how many have
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted tails and I'm going to make a
note and I'm going to write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, out of a hundred, they sprouted
tails or they did not sprout tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll close it back up and I'll let
the other ones keep going and I'll see in
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 hours how many made tails and I'll take
good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put some of those, the ones that
did sprout tails and look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put those into some cups of
dirt and I'm going to grow them and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pay attention to them and I'm
going to keep a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dry them, cure them,
smoke them, make concentrates out of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at least 120 days from even knowing
what that product tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably closer to 150 with the dry and
cure phase in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is my first grow with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I approve, then I'll pass some seeds
onto Grim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Grim Bull grows it and it looks good in
his garden, then I'll spread it out to a
[SPEAKER_00]: few more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they grow it well, that's when I'll let
it go to a vendor or for retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I test the shit out of my feminine
seeds and my regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stand behind my product and honestly,
every feminine seed that I produce sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep feminine seeds in stock and I
don't get any complaints on my feminine
[SPEAKER_00]: seed products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how fems are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I make my fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to feminine seeds is there
are no males to remove from the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that every seed you plant will
result in a harvested crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to grow it long enough to
sex it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be wasting any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's advantageous for people who live in
medical states or anybody who is limited
[SPEAKER_00]: by a plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your feminized seeds are all going to
be females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you would say, why would people grow
photoperiod seeds when they can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds and guarantee that
everything they grow makes it to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, a lot of people have a bias
against feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people like myself like
finding the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding with females and reversed females
and alpha females is a great practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like working with a solid male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a passion for conventional
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make feminized seeds, but I have more
fun with conventional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you may notice when you're
shopping for seeds is that feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are about twice the price of regular
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you do get viable females that you
can take to harvest, but that pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds cost exactly twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice is what a regular pack of seeds
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you didn't have to waste the
time, the space, the soil, the energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you didn't have to have that extra
plant count to add to your numbers in your
[SPEAKER_00]: legal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the packaging says feminized seeds,
that means that 99.9% of the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of that seed package will be
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something that is kind of a
side rant that I was talking to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media about that I want to
include in a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to give it a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we flip to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized and regular photo period seeds,
we flip them to flower by changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle, either from 24 on and zero
off to 18 on and six off, or however
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got your light cycle set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you switch to 12 on and 12 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're going to follow the DJ short
plan, you go 11 on 13 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we flip to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your seed package will give you an
estimate of how long they need to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine to 10 weeks, 60 to 70 days,
whatever it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you initiated that flip is day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the day you see buds set, not the day
you smell something, not the day the
[SPEAKER_00]: butterflies flew in and did their magic
dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you change that timer is day one
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you keep track of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're talking about when we
indicated that on the seed package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to add that side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that was even relevant,
but there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bonus nugget for your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work into auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by an auto flowering seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, I was talking about your location
in relation to the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us live in an area where we see
seasonal changes and we also see changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in day and nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, there are parts of
Russia and Alaska that will receive
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme stretches of daylight and
nighttime without interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some points in Alaska when they
will have full sunlight for 80 days in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not get a night for 80 solid
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is an extraordinary plant and it
has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis that we are familiar with,
which has evolved from these extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions with no dark, is known as
ruteralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ruteralis plants have evolved to
flower without any dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: After so many generations, they went,
hey, it doesn't get dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do something about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through evolution, they started to
flower without a dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those ruteralis plants have no
desirable effect when smoked, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of desirable traits when grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them stay short, they stay squat,
they push out really nicely, and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to change the light cycle to convince
them to flower for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis breeders got a hold of
ruteralis plants and they bred them
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bred our auto flowering ruteralis to
our high potency cannabis plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring resulted in high potency auto
flowering cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the auto flowering seeds available
for most breeders now are feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get auto flowering seeds that
are all girls, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous and we'll talk about that in
just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should warn you that when you're looking
at seeds and you see feminized seeds on
[SPEAKER_00]: there, also look to see if they say photo
period or auto flower on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they indicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't, they are probably photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the auto flower guys like to let
you know that you're working with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They clearly indicate that on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that feminized seeds
cost twice as much as regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers generally cost twice as much
as feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your regular, then they're even
doubled again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will let you know if they're auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you read the package when
you're buying your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll either say regular or feminized or
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do a little research before you buy
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit about how
these auto flower seeds are useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to the show for a
while, you love my favorite example of
[SPEAKER_00]: these auto flowers in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several years ago, there was a very large
grow discovered in a national forest not
[SPEAKER_00]: too far from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was discovered that that grow was
ran by a cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the reports and pictures came out,
they were saying that the cartel had three
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of growth happening in
their illegal grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that really made me wonder,
how are they growing different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors because the sun dictates what our
plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they put them outside, they all went
into flower at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my brain went, dude, they're using
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this large cartel would set a patch of
auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they would wait a few weeks and they
would set another large patch of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower plants, wait a few weeks and set
another large patch of auto flower plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to where eventually they had a perpetual
cycle going to where they had people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in this national forest,
camouflaged, hidden, growing a perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, packaging up and sending it to who
knows where, I have no idea where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going, but they were producing quite a bit
of cannabis out there by using auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a perpetual grow under the
natural sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have to veg and then flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could just throw the seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would grow and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way where auto flower seeds
were highly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's scale that down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you've only got one grow space
and you want to produce a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go buy clones from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a friend produce veg for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you could run a small
self-sustainable perpetual grow is with
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower plants in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill up a quarter or half of the room with
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they start flowering,
plant more auto flowers and put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have veg plants and flowering
plants in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that with photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're limited on space,
if you've only got one room, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really useful method and a really useful
application for auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major downside that I see to auto
flowering plants is you always have to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot clone an auto flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing with regular or
feminized photo period seeds, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: always able to cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep that clone as a mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can always clone off of that
mother and you can keep that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: With auto flowers, you're always going to
be buying new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And earlier I mentioned most of the auto
flower companies are only putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not even able to breed your own
auto flowers with males and females
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to reverse one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no experience doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my breakdown
on regular seeds, feminized seeds and auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regular seeds are always photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them because we find males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like breeding with the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminized seeds can be photo period or
they can be auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably well marked on the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always going to be females if
they were bred properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a whole other podcast episode
about marking feminized seeds with S or R1
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to listen to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is episode 331 and it's titled
Selfing and Reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn a lot about why we label the
packages the way we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend you listen to an episode
called Seed Pack Expectations and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: number 245.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of useful information in
that episode for anyone who is considering
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowering plants are unique to photo
period plants because they flower based on
[SPEAKER_00]: their size or their age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put them under the veg lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have them in the 18-6 room and they
will still flower and they will still
[SPEAKER_00]: produce buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of auto flowering plants boast that
they will be completely done around 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 70 days of a full cycle with a
photo period plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got closer to 120 days if you want
usable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my lesson on regular,
feminized and auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made your decision easier when it
comes time to go shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to try regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to try feminized seeds and
don't be afraid to try auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just may fall in love with something
you never thought you would even like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget, you can find your seeds
at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on a Black Friday sale,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should get interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've only been going for about
22 minutes, but honestly, my recording
[SPEAKER_00]: gear has been giving me a couple of
technical issues and my throat is
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap this up while I've
still got a quality podcast on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose any of the stuff I
recorded.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get all the equipment fixed up so I
quit getting glitches in the recording
[SPEAKER_00]: gear and I don't have to wrap up the end
so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give your mama a hug for me.
Thank you.
