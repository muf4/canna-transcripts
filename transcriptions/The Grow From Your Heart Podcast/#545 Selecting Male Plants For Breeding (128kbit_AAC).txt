[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been taking dabs of sour best lemons
live batter from our friends at green dot
[SPEAKER_01]: labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a blend of s b s e and lemon tree
northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what s b s e means,
but it smells fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the package, the flavor is described as
lemons, lemons, and more lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the descriptions are spot on
sometimes they're questionable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, it's fucking lemons times
lemons plus lemon squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour best lemons, just opening the package
and holding it a few inches from my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting lemon candy, lemon play,
and lemon punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something real citrusy and kind of
sharp getting to my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting it a little closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a gross delicious lemon aroma and
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is abundant and ridiculously lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say lemon turps enough when it
comes to this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take dabs of this, it makes my
brain spin around in my head for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about the lemon turp in
this that just makes my brain spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the remaining buzz after that is
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps me nice and talkative on the
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: The back of the package, it says it
contains 64.61% total THC and zero CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really dig this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to be a great concentrate
podcast because it has got me stoned and
[SPEAKER_01]: rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that always makes for a good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
in this episode, I am going to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: a thing I get asked quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last episode, we talked about
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this episode, I'm going to talk
about male selection, selecting a male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the things I say when it comes to
male plant selection also applies to
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll touch on that a little bit when it
comes to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of the friends who support
[SPEAKER_01]: the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off with the big Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_01]: I need to send a giant fist bump and a
giant thank you shout out to my buddy

[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, thank you again for the giant
contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giant fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I could help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's also send a big giant Grow From Your

[SPEAKER_01]: least let's send a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast thank you shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend Sean 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not already supporting the show
on Patreon and you would like to learn how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do so all you have to do is visit www
.patreon.com forward slash Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the information you will need will
be right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I did include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get your hands full if you're busy
just click on that link it will get you
[SPEAKER_01]: right to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will make it very easy for you to
support the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we are talking about Patreon I
should make a short announcement a
[SPEAKER_01]: disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is changing many things on their
service.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things they have changed is
taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand completely how the
taxes are going to work on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a really long thing that I need to
read through and understand before I agree
[SPEAKER_01]: to anything but it is something that is
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to stop being on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to pay them taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When money moves Uncle Sam wants a cut
somebody wants a piece of that pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time a pie gets cooked somebody
wants a bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be some things happening on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to read on your contributor end
and I will read on my creator end and we
[SPEAKER_01]: will read together and be clear of what's
happening on Patreon so that there are no
[SPEAKER_01]: surprises at the beginning of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are making adjustments while they
were making adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I adjusted some of the tiers and benefits
to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly I was getting a lot of 420
contributors and people when I say you
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute 420 they're expecting a shout
out on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to raise that tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved everything up one tier because I
could not keep up with the shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm falling behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did increase the tiers everything
moved up by one tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will continue the shout outs until I'm
caught up and then I will change all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that next month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get what you paid for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the future some of the tiers will
increase in price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fair to the audience because I
couldn't keep up with all of the Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to fall behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were going to give me money to say
their name on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be eight episodes before I
can give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't feel fair to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just simply increased that cost
that will automatically slow down the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of shout outs I have to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe maybe people will pay extra which in
turn that will mean I have to do more
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either way it's going to work out for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys I don't want anybody to feel
shortchanged since Patreon added taxes and
[SPEAKER_01]: I adjusted some things on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt that it was my responsibility to
come and be straightforward about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I edited some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are new tiers available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are new options and thank you once
again for all of the Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate it you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I'm able to keep the show
afloat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I'm able to make sure that if
this equipment goes weird I've had to
[SPEAKER_01]: replace a few pieces of my equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headphone amplifiers they go out quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to make sure to have brand new
microphone covers if anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's COVID times right now so I don't have
guests here on the show but the Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: pays for the Zoom account the website
account my internet connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the sort of stuff we're covering
with Patreon plus these little fuzzy
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone covers so that I'm not spitting
into the same one week after week so that
[SPEAKER_01]: if Mike comes over Jesse comes over
they're not spitting into the same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody have on the show gets a freshie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to recycle those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a couple of pieces of equipment
take a shit on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've replaced that with Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This computer the old MacBook started
making funny noises and I couldn't render
[SPEAKER_01]: video on that thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cleaned it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I refurbished it as many times as I could
handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was making the show not as fun and easy
to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used Patreon contributions to
upgrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fresh computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about a year maybe two years ago
but I've got a good firing up computer
[SPEAKER_01]: that works very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on Zoom right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recording via Zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way easy for me to record and edit
using Zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tech talk you don't care about but
it's really easy using the new computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Patreon contributions are what keep
the show moving smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also sometimes you may help me out getting
the extra four gram jar so that I can get
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely baked and produce a really good
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I do a good job when I'm nice and
stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people they don't work super well
when you get them high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some people that I've worked with
them and I've taken them to lunch and
[SPEAKER_01]: allegedly given them a couple of dabs and
I've had to take them back to work and set
[SPEAKER_01]: them in a chair and tell them sit there
and don't fucking move because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna break something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be you or it might be some
equipment but don't touch anything because
[SPEAKER_01]: something will get hurt today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like myself and like White
Mike and like most of the crew that hangs
[SPEAKER_01]: out we take a couple of dabs and we are
able to function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think keeping me stocked up with good
dabs and good equipment will keep this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy that turned into a long fucking ramble
about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be changes and I am not trying
to abandon you or insult you or pull a
[SPEAKER_01]: fast one on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I edited some shit so go take a look if
you're contributing on Patreon check out
[SPEAKER_01]: what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I simply moved the scale over one for most
of the lower level tiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're thinking you're gonna get a
shout out for 420 now there's 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you thought you're gonna get your
message read for 710 now that's $10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to keep up with myself so that
I can provide the things I'm promising and
[SPEAKER_01]: not fall far behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of why I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that we were going to talk about
male selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh before we get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also mentioned I am looking for music
for the podcast and I've mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to pay and or trade or
compensate on artist and or musician or a
[SPEAKER_01]: group for some music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a couple of wonderful
submissions and contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten so many that honestly I can't
sort through all of them right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: check which one I like the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of them got my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one guy that sent me like three or
four options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like your style bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep them coming because I can use
intros.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use outros.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use mid show stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be playing music right now if I
had a cool little just something subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not too much behind me just a bass
line a little reggae drum beat maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: chucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a musician you know kind of
chucking I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep the great music submissions
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a long appointment to get my
dreadlocks worked on this week and I
[SPEAKER_01]: intend to take an earbud and just put that
on while they're working on my dreads and
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to a bunch of shit and answer a
bunch of emails while I'm sitting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid for three hours to sit in a chair
and get my dreads twisted on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also random side note a listener or a
viewer on YouTube asked to see my
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlocks bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: These dreads are a fucking mess right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get them maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get them loved on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't work on them on the top of my head
very well by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I record another episode maybe
two I will have been to the dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_01]: salon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a very good dread stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to call her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a very wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does a really good job working on
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to do a great job fixing on my
dreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that I'll bust out the dreads and
show you what they look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a fucking mess right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're real long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go past my knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's worth waiting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get them fixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was random.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are we talking about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to share with you guys what is
happening in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been following along you know
that recently I acquired some Jack the
[SPEAKER_01]: Ripper seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that I found a beautiful Jack the
Ripper male within that pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you also know I found a couple of
select Jack the Ripper females.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are successfully pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pistols have curled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pistols are brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like seeds are developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few other select females in
that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've revealed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is of course I put an Arise in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to pollinate the Arise with the
Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would I be doing if I didn't take one
of Sub's best made creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of his best breeders and put that to
one of my most known creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of the idea of the project
to cross those two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the initial idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course I loaded the room up with a
few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've revealed a couple on other
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to burp into the microphone
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've revealed a couple of the
other strains on other episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else should we talk about today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to post a photo of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a Blueberry Cookies female that
has been pollinated by Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be very promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those strains have a very
beautiful shape, a very beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, great aromas, tremendous buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: This should be a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple other things in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll trickle out more names,
more ideas as the show goes by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've said this before, everyone's
going to ask me for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testers, chill out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds are just forming within the
calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the calyxes swelling up with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got probably four to five more
weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chop them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been over this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to repeat all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testers will be coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do like is excitement and eagerness
for names.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we call Jack the Ripper to
Blueberry Cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we call Jack the Ripper to Golden
Goat?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got name ideas, I would love to
see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great way to do it would be to just send
them to me on an email at
[SPEAKER_01]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com or leave
them in the comments on the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see comments of strain
names in the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a Blueberry Cookies female
pollinated by a Jack the Ripper male,
[SPEAKER_01]: a Golden Goat female pollinated by a Jack
the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as far as we'll go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just go for those two now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got name ideas, throw them in
the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a future episode, I will talk about how
I choose strain names because I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you've noticed I've got a little bit of a
theme, a schema, an idea around my strain
[SPEAKER_01]: names.
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't all consistent, but you can
see where my mind is, where my brain is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't, I'll talk more about that in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my breeding tent, I've got that going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think now it is time to talk about
selecting male plants for breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important part about
selecting plants for breeding is having a
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, maybe you grew some seeds and you
ended up with a male and a female and you
[SPEAKER_01]: thought, I'll breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, are those seeds worth the
shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just a hobby grower,
if you're looking to supply yourself with
[SPEAKER_01]: some seeds to play with, that's a
beautiful project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be a little more serious
about it, if you're somebody like myself
[SPEAKER_01]: who is putting seeds out for market,
my seeds are available at seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're available at several other
vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to make sure that my seeds are
reliable, that they have a reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome, that they have a good germination
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to have a goal in mind when I'm
making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're just pollen chucking,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's your goal, if you want to fuck
around, we're not all setting out to be
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals at everything we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just want to have a little fun
making some seeds, growing seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're self-sustainable that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to lock down and get
into the breeding game, if you really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get serious about breeding,
there are a few major steps you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: take.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I really recommend,
I didn't write this down, this is off the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of my head, something I thought I
should include, read some books.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of knowledge just hidden in
pages of books, and it's mostly free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a lot of books available in
PDF form on the internet now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you type in breeding books by Greg
Green or Mel Frank or Robert Connell
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark, any of those books will be filled
with enough knowledge to blow your mind
[SPEAKER_01]: and make you a decent breeder,
a decent, a well-educated person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who could have a good idea of breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those books give you a lot of
wonderful ideas, but you have to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: shit to actually understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you've read some books about
breeding, read about allele charts and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendel charts, understand what Gregor
Mendel had in mind, understand what his
[SPEAKER_01]: goal was, understand what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will really give you more intuition
on breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read some books about breeding,
read about Mendel charts, understand
[SPEAKER_01]: alleles, understand chromosomes,
understand the basic biology of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will really give you a head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you understand all of that stuff
and it comes time to breed, forget all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit and go with your intuition and
take two plants that you know are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a positive outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds like a lot of silly
steps because I just told you learn a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of shit, then forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a trained musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a side rant that will make what
I'm saying relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand how to read and write music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can read a chart and play it while I'm
reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can turn the page with one hand and keep
the groove going and keep playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not bragging about my musical skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying I'm so comfortable at reading a
chart that I can play it very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes concert time, we don't take
the charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't take the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to remember the songs on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever your favorite band is,
they don't have music on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I studied the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a very deep understanding of what
each note means in that song.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so ingrained in my heart that when I
get on stage, it's intuitive and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: make the wrong decisions because I've got
the proper training and the right
[SPEAKER_01]: instincts and my education take over and
the music comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, sometimes I fuck up on stage,
but that's the beauty of music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can fall on your face and
nobody gets hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hope to catch the one when it comes
back around and you keep fucking going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I compare that to breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read all your books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a solid education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a solid foundation and then get out
there and freestyle when the time comes
[SPEAKER_01]: and it should come out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things will come out successfully,
but have some sort of education and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all of that being said, we need to
have a goal when we are breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal and the traits you are seeking
have a lot to do with the male plant you
[SPEAKER_01]: select for your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your male plant is going to contribute at
least 50% of his stuff to your breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making a cake, the male is 50%
of your ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have good shit to start with or
this cake will never taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some good traits that we
want to find in a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to find these traits is to
grow the male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a population of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many seeds you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can grow a lot, grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A minimum of 10 if you're looking for a
male, a lot more if you've got the space,
[SPEAKER_01]: the time, and the legal means to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grow a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to select a male out of
that population of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to select a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right away, I don't want, so if we take 10
plants, we pop 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to get your hands on a 10 pack
of seeds, a 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of breeders offer that at a fair
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely, we're going to find out of
10, we're going to find somewhere between
[SPEAKER_01]: four and six males.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to remove the females from the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do whatever you want with that part of
your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm going to play with the
males in this grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got four to six males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one that shows me it's a male is
probably not going to be a breeding male.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that is the tallest and the
stretchiest and the proudest to get up
[SPEAKER_01]: there is probably not going to be my
breeding male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes those are the first two males
that I get rid of, and I'll tell you why
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't qualify.
[SPEAKER_01]: A minute ago, I said I want my male to be
50% of my breeding mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those big boys that get too big right
away, those guys that start to pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately, in my opinion, they dominate
the recipe too much, and they don't show
[SPEAKER_01]: enough of the female that I use in my
crosses when I do breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we took this male and I put it
on a strawberry fields plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say that I took a chocolate
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just picking two things that are
different, chocolate and strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I breed those, my goal is chocolate
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothetically, as a breeder, I'm partly
chefing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want chocolate strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my male plant is too dominant in his
genes, if he's too fucking raw,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we got a big caveman that's at the gym
all the time, that guy is going to overdo
[SPEAKER_01]: dominate my mix, and I'm going to make
more chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get enough strawberry out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to look like this guy,
and maybe if that's what you were looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for as a breeder, maybe that's a success,
but that's not what I started out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to find a male that flowers a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to find a male that doesn't show me
flower right away and doesn't get real
[SPEAKER_01]: tall immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason the males are getting super
tall is so they can get up above the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy and drop pollen down on all of the
females, and they can be the dominant male
[SPEAKER_01]: that wins the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their generations get to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't choose the first or second male
that will show me flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we had somewhere between four and
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're down to about four or two,
maybe three males left to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to watch these guys grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any weirdo plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got a weirdo plant that's doing in
veg, doing weird shapes, weird structures,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not going to set myself up for
success in future breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want more weirdo shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gots to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about it like people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see people out there,
unfortunately, if you see some weirdo
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking people walking around scratching
their head, yelling at the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: telephone pole, you don't want to breed
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see people that look like they got
their shit together, their body is in
[SPEAKER_01]: line, they're healthy, they're fucking
smiling, they got a good presentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to breed with them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants should be the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at a plant going,
I don't know, things kind of fucked up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to breed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you want to continue that gene?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to make more tens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to make a bunch of fucking
sixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are sixes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to take maybe a six and a
seven and make them into a 10 or make two
[SPEAKER_01]: eights into an 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to improve when you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want problematic plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about problems in a moment,
but I want something, a male plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't the tallest, not the first to flower
and doesn't show me any weird growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's got problems from the beginning,
if he was a struggler, I may not use that
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need struggles in my offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, make sure or I
recommend to take a male or take a clone
[SPEAKER_01]: of your male plants before we go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a really great male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call him King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got a Jack the Ripper male that
I'm playing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just call it Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got clones of them so that when I
make successful crosses with these,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use them again and again and again
because I'll keep cloning and having a
[SPEAKER_01]: father plant, same as a mother plant,
but it's a dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have that plant around for continued
production so I can keep producing pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: from him and keep making more successful
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend that you get a clone of your
favorite male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are things to look for,
traits that we want to seek in our male,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shape and the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want squat and bushy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want tall and skinny plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want plants that make one main
cola?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that is an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running a whole bunch of plants
on a table and you just want to turn them
[SPEAKER_01]: and burn them, you can put 64 plants on a
four by four table.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow up to make one main stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You flip them real early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get 64 10 gram buds at 640 grams from
one light, not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, you can breed plants to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want tall plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want skinny plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want bushy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want big wide leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want little skinny leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can breed that into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the selection that you make
with your parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want branchy and sturdy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want branchy and sturdy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want branchy plants with lots of good
structure, close internodal spacing,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice, beefy branches that will hold up big
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want male plants that are going to make
big, fat, male clusters that will
[SPEAKER_01]: translate to big female buds when it comes
down to the progeny in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I don't like is a hollow plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got a male plant and I top it and
that center is hollow, you can feel them
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're working with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look at them and see them from
across the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not select a hollow male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just something I don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer it to not be the super hollow
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All about the structure and the leaf
shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want short, squatty plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want big, branchy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, I like those taller,
longer branchier plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot more production out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in commercial grows where we
trellis them and work them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can manipulate those plants to give me a
lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a male that represents the structure
you would like to recreate because that
[SPEAKER_01]: male is going to give at least 50% of its
structure to the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also think about odors, aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only going to be half of the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind, think about when you
grow plants and veg, you rub the stem,
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells kind of weird, but when you dry
it and cure it, it doesn't smell like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is consistency in the way those
aromas change.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smells like puke when you're rubbing
the stem, it's going to have gassy,
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky aromas toward the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smells like sweet feet and berries,
it's going to smell like fruit and
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries and shit toward the end of
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just things that you'll
experience as you go along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to rub the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a male personally that smells a
little bit like puke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds horrible, but they make
great breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a male plant that when I rub the
stem early in veg or late in veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells a little bit like the bar trash
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fermented funky disgustingness always
translates into a good breeding male in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a little bit of sweetness,
a little bit of chem and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that male plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make wonderful fucking
offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want something that is the
complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want something that smells like
peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want something that smells like
watermelons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the one that works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a big part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of breeding is science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about read all the books,
learn all the charts, do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I said forget it all because that is
where it comes to an art form also.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are making a lot of decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be educated, but they also
have to be artful with a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things to keep in mind
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like a color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reds, pinks, purples, different shades of
greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those different colors will
translate in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get 25% of your offspring may show
that color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 50%, maybe up to 75% of your
offspring will have that color depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on the traits of the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got something that puts off some
purples, it is very good to breed with
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant in my opinion if purple is what
you're going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is something you should really look
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of your male plants is putting off
trichomes, that's a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should use him in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male plant is putting off triches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not rare, but it's not super common.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find that in about three out of 10
keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll put off trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a boy that's putting off
resin, the female that he pollinates will
[SPEAKER_01]: put off resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds that come from that,
they will put off resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a good resin producing female
and a good resin producing male,
[SPEAKER_01]: you put those together, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Double resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just made a double resin Oreo right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a trichomed male,
use that guy because it is going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: very well in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else we should think about when
it comes to selecting a male plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's also talk about veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did the plant grow and veg?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it explode with growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it slow and shitty and lanky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it problematic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it give you any issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it need support too early?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were the stocks nice and robust?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we should think about flowering time
and veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it veg?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of time you veg most of
your plants, did this plant keep up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it smaller?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it bigger?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it average?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you put it into flower,
how did it react?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it take to show you that it
was a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it try to show you that it was a male
way before you flowered it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it become root bound and start putting
off male flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not breed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long from the time you induced flower
to the time you started seeing male parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: then how long until those male parts
started opening up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then how long until peak pollination time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to that stuff because that
is going to correlate and relate to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time of your offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like to let the males go for
quite a while, seven, eight, maybe nine or
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that male plant keeps growing and stays
nice and healthy, and keeps getting huge
[SPEAKER_01]: towards eight or nine weeks, your
offspring could take eight or nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 10 or 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to that male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of breeders and a lot of
growers do not grow out male plants far
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to see what they've got to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be amazed at what you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it keep spitting out pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, it's got to spit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to breed commercially and
put the seeds out, it's got to spit out
[SPEAKER_01]: enough pollen to make it worth your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why feminized seeds are so damn
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you reverse a plant, you've got to be
very careful about how you do it and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get near as much pollen as you do
from a well selected male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're getting enough pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it continue to spit out
pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you get enough pollen to make it
worth your breeding time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about issues, things that would
make me not select a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned before a hollow plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like a hollow male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like a slow shitty grower if it
takes a long time to hatch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's weak and spindly, it cannot hang
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I mentioned earlier, if it's too
robust, if it's too dominant, if we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a Hulk Hogan or the Ultimate Warrior in
there, I may not choose that one for
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding because I'm just going to make a
bunch more Ultimate Warriors, a bunch more
[SPEAKER_01]: Hulk Hogans, a bunch more testosterone
ridden superbeasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, does this male plant respond well to
feeding and pH issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of abuse my male plants a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: like I do the females feed them poorly see
how they react.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck up the pH see how they react.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if they get PM see if they are
attracted to pests some plants the bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: just love to come around as soon as you
start growing some plants the spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: go what's that new smell Larry this thing
smells good let's go invade and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: go get it so see if it brings bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I mentioned earlier does it auto
flower does anything cause this male plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to go into flower before you have flipped
the lights to 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it got a little bit root bound and
decided to auto flower don't breed with it
[SPEAKER_01]: if it got a little bit underfed and it
decided to go flower on you get rid of it
[SPEAKER_01]: don't breed with it if it's auto flowering
on you that is going to continue over into
[SPEAKER_01]: the progeny and your customers will not be
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier if you're breeding for
yourself you can do whatever you want as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as you are aware of what could happen
you are making your own creations you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to share them with anybody but
if you're putting them out to market they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be reliable they need to be more
consistent let's make sure I'm still
[SPEAKER_01]: recording because my computer just did
some weird shit not even gonna edit this
[SPEAKER_01]: out yeah we're still going we're cool all
right just got a notification I've got my
[SPEAKER_01]: notifications turned off so that was whack
but you didn't hear it we'll keep moving I
[SPEAKER_01]: apologize for the distraction where are we
auto flower you don't want one that auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to think about is were there
problematic plants within that seed stock
[SPEAKER_01]: did you grow out females and find problems
in the females because it's most likely
[SPEAKER_01]: that you grew a population of girls who
were looking for that keeper what you see
[SPEAKER_01]: in those girls was there a hermaphrodite
were there intersex traits amongst the
[SPEAKER_01]: female population which you found from the
same seed pack if so that gives me a
[SPEAKER_01]: little suspect a little question a little
apprehension to breed with that plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: tells me there is intersex traits within
the seed line somewhere in that DNA it is
[SPEAKER_01]: possible I don't know that I want to pass
that it could be a recessive trait it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a dominant trait it may pop up in
the next generation it may pop up two
[SPEAKER_01]: generations from now it may not pop up at
all I don't know that I would set myself
[SPEAKER_01]: up with that time bomb that's kind of a
problem waiting to happen so were there
[SPEAKER_01]: problems in the rest of the seed stock did
you have any trouble were there
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodites were there freaks were
there mutants in the other seed stock
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just something to keep in mind as a
breeder that's something I like to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about I also really like to know the
parents of my breeding stock like I know
[SPEAKER_01]: what made King Solomon I made King Solomon
and I know what made the parents that made
[SPEAKER_01]: those parents so I know far down the line
I know the grandparents of my breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: stock I know the great grandparents of
some of my lines that are out so I just
[SPEAKER_01]: really like to know what's going on then I
there aren't many surprises then I have
[SPEAKER_01]: less I've got the more data you have the
less surprises you're going to have is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I think I'm trying to say so um where
are we now on my list herms pollinate the
[SPEAKER_01]: next step to do I think is to select
qualifying females um briefly females that
[SPEAKER_01]: are not hermaphroditic females that are
not problematic females that are resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: to pests and problems and pathogens and
molds and mildews and issues plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: can take a beating plants that you've got
a goal for breeding them to maybe you just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make some new seeds but if you
notice in my breeding I am using things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are very dominant in flavors and then
I'm using a male that is very dominant in
[SPEAKER_01]: potency so I put my potent male on
flavorful odorifice odoriferous females
[SPEAKER_01]: and I get potent and terpy plants out of
that so select quality females then
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate earlier I mentioned that a lot
of this talk would work on a reversed
[SPEAKER_01]: plant as well if you've got a female that
fits this criteria that grows well has a
[SPEAKER_01]: good structure doesn't hermaphrodite
smells great branchy sturdy has the node
[SPEAKER_01]: spacing and the shape and leaf structure
you're looking for you can reverse that
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a very good candidate for making a
candidate for making feminized seeds make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure it's not a hermaphrodite beat it up
abuse it stress it light stress it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last episode I talked about how I stress
test my fem seeds my female plants before
[SPEAKER_01]: I make fem seeds do that see if it herms
if it doesn't give you any issues that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant will work very well as a pollen
donor plant to be reversed so we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: our male or we've got our reversal our
next step is to get the plants to the
[SPEAKER_01]: right stage and pollinate the females are
going to need to be around day 18 23 25
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the cultivar I've got one
plant that wants pollen like 27 day 30
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes so it's all about the female
when her pistols are nice and ripe when
[SPEAKER_01]: she's ovulating and wants to get
pollinated the male plant depends on the
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant you've selected probably around
day 14 17 21 up to day 32 ish you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be getting pollen pollinate keep
documentation of pollen pollination times
[SPEAKER_01]: right down when the pollen starts I
flipped on day one on day seven I saw male
[SPEAKER_01]: sacks on day 12 pollen was coming out
write that down then write down peak
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination time when did this plant
really start dumping pollen then also if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can keep it around long enough
document when the plant stopped dumping
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen that's also important to know your
window how long do I get to make pollen so
[SPEAKER_01]: document that then also document the day
you pollinate your plants so that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: how long you've got to grow these plants
and how long those seeds take to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: the more data the more success you will
have in the future you can set patterns
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can set expectations and you can
make corrections based on your data write
[SPEAKER_01]: down a lot of shit so get your females at
their peak point for pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination seeds the feed the plants is
normal I don't give them big bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: boosters I reduce the bloom boosters I'm
not trying to make big fat buds I increase
[SPEAKER_01]: my cal mag a little bit I continue with
nitrogen and I do add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids when I'm making seeds amino
acids are really good for starting life
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting those seeds nice and healthy I
also make sure to just take really good
[SPEAKER_01]: care of the plants overall their overall
health is really important make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: they're phed and fed and watered and
defoliated and fucking love for properly
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll have happy seeds I do a few
other tricks that I've talked about in
[SPEAKER_01]: other episodes but we're not going to
delve too far into that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep talking about selecting a male so now
the seeds are ready for harvest right time
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on we've got seeds we chop them and
cut them the next important thing to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow these seeds we don't know if this
male plant we have selected is worth a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit until we grow these seeds now I'm
going to branch off some people are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to want to try multiple male plants to the
same female plant for breeding I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like that idea I honestly don't see a way
that you're going to stop pollen from male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant A and male plant B and male plant C
from cross contaminating your female plant
[SPEAKER_01]: so when you grow the offspring you never
know which male plant was the champion you
[SPEAKER_01]: just wonder who to baby daddy and you
don't know which male plant to breed with
[SPEAKER_01]: again and it's kind of a waste of time in
my opinion pick one male plant breed with
[SPEAKER_01]: him at a time that is my advice in my
opinion I think I've been successful and
[SPEAKER_01]: so my words may may have some weight it
may show I've been successful with that
[SPEAKER_01]: advice you guys it's all I'm saying but
run this run the seeds that you've grown
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a batch of seeds from either
one female or multiple females run them
[SPEAKER_01]: see what you've got check the germination
rate how many seeds if you can germinate
[SPEAKER_01]: ten of them how many popped when you put
them in your germination method did you
[SPEAKER_01]: get nine out of ten you get eight out of
ten or you champion all ten germinated
[SPEAKER_01]: check that out germination rate is very
important then grow them watch them grow
[SPEAKER_01]: they look like fucking mutant plants do
they look like they're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: struggles the entire time do they look
like good plants flower them do they make
[SPEAKER_01]: good buds are the plants that you just
created better than both of the parents
[SPEAKER_01]: that you started with because if not
there's no point in continuing this line
[SPEAKER_01]: unless it is doing something magical for
you when you smoke it if you feel perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it but the goal is to improve upon
the two lines that we started with so
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to grow them out look for
hermaphrodites look for intersex traits
[SPEAKER_01]: look for problems are there a mutant is it
worth the shit does it take too long to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower are they very inconsistent are they
very uniform you can have positive and
[SPEAKER_01]: negative things to document at this time
but we've got to be sure that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: improved on the quality of the line of
cannabis that is our main goal here as a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder if you haven't made it better
there's no point in breeding so you either
[SPEAKER_01]: need to excuse me you either need to f to
these seeds to make them better or abandon
[SPEAKER_01]: the project altogether if you're giving
them out let your friends know hey these
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't the best seeds that I've ever made
but they are free so you can have them you
[SPEAKER_01]: can give them away you can share them but
set the expectation when you give them
[SPEAKER_01]: away don't say these are fucking amazing
seeds go hey these are they're okay
[SPEAKER_01]: they're good I mean be honest with
yourself I have made some okay seeds you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see them at any of the vendors
because they are okay I only put out the
[SPEAKER_01]: champs and if they don't show to be champs
after I put them out for a while if I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see a lot of great success I will
discontinue them for sales and I will give
[SPEAKER_01]: them away as freebies I'll pass them out
to my friends if you stop by the booth
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm out somewhere in public and you
say hey what's up maybe I'll just pass you
[SPEAKER_01]: a pack of them for freebies but I don't
sell them I don't make a profit off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bees or the nines I put out tens and
eleven you guys and that should be your
[SPEAKER_00]: goal as well as a cannabis breeder if
you're listening on audio I apologize I
[SPEAKER_01]: just took a long drink I was getting real
dry if you're watching the video big up
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you for sticking with me all right
so the main important part is have a goal
[SPEAKER_01]: have something in mind do you want to make
indica dominant plants do you want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa dominant plants are you aiming for
a certain cannabinoid are you aiming for a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain terpene are you aiming for a
certain growth structure what is your goal
[SPEAKER_01]: have a goal in mind when you're crossing
select a male that will fit your criteria
[SPEAKER_01]: for your goal I understand we don't all
have unlimited seeds find something that
[SPEAKER_01]: works the best out of the pack of seeds
you've got pay attention for dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: traits or positive traits pay attention
for negative traits decide if that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant you want to breed with do the work
breed with it chuck that motherfucking
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen let those plants have their action
then you've got to grow the seeds that is
[SPEAKER_01]: where the real test of your work comes in
see if your progeny if your offspring if
[SPEAKER_01]: your children are worth a shit or if you
just need to get rid of that male and
[SPEAKER_01]: start all over again that's not a bad
decision that is very respectable and
[SPEAKER_01]: reputable decision if it doesn't work it
doesn't work get rid of it don't do that
[SPEAKER_01]: some things just won't work that is the
way the numbers work sometimes you get
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing crosses sometimes you get a whole
bunch of bullshit so it's all up to you
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all about your goal try your best to
reach your goal and if you don't reach
[SPEAKER_01]: your goal don't be afraid try try again
like I said before when we're growing when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're growing plants when we're playing
music if we crash and fuck up the best
[SPEAKER_01]: part is you don't get hurt it may cost
time and money but you get to get up and
[SPEAKER_01]: try it again all right I think that
