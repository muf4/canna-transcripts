seeds later in this episode.

[SPEAKER_00]: fudge cake fem seeds in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check out our friends at Neptune

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a big shout out to
everybody I met at the groovy gravy secret
[SPEAKER_00]: stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an amazing time at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Mike with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drove up from Pueblo up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early Saturday morning, we made it into
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to unload our gear right in front
of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and parked the car and then Mike
helped me carry everything in as we were
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying things in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who showed up?
[SPEAKER_00]: My bro Billy bong showed up to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he was flying in from Hawaii to
make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy had quite the adventure getting from
Hawaii to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every flight was delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that could have gone wonky went
wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude Billy keeps a positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great time at the end of the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, Billy, you want to go get
dinner?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me with these glazed eyes
and he's like, bro, I'm so exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Billy took off after the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went and crashed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I went got some food and then
headed home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very successful event for irie genetics
and team irie army.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold a bunch of seeds, but more
importantly, we got to see the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crew was another great community based
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the irie army comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that know me kind of
peripherally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big word for the show here that
knows from other breeders and just the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finally got to come say hi,
shake my hand, check out the booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: get some stickers, get introduced to Mike
and myself, learn about the podcast to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how we set up a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a great time to go network and
get some exposure and meet a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came by the booth at the Groovy
Gravy Secret Stash, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for popping by.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you gave me seeds, weed, hash,
concentrates, edibles, things I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mention here on the show, thank you for
all of the amazing gifts that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: given at the Groovy Gravy Secret Stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to send an extra special
shout out to my dude at Bubba's
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, those cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't even be eating cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there some dietary restrictions that I
do break because cheesecake?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, those cheesecakes were delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba, if you ever see this, thank you for
the delicious cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole team was happy with the
cheesecakes we all ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly bought two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'm going to eat about half of
these and then I'm going to offer them to
[SPEAKER_00]: other people so that I don't eat both of
these cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little cheesecake guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think I'm a real huge savage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a half savage, but I got about
halfway through the first cheesecake and I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized I don't like my friends as much
as I like cheesecake and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go get their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I devoured two cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go too far, I want to give a
big shout out to my buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know him as white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call him Mike these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike has been helping me out a lot with
the I read genetics trade show booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I had the vid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't make it to the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike took the entire booth in his car.
[SPEAKER_00]: He set up the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left an impact on the community because
this year at the dude grows cup everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: knew who Mike was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was super cool to see Mike making
a step up in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: People know who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys remember him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go show him some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also Mike went to the groovy gravy
secret stash and I love how Mike is just
[SPEAKER_00]: falling into place and learning exactly
how to run the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I want the booth exactly
ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike doesn't know exactly how I want the
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're figuring it out as it goes
through different trade shows and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: built a really nice flow together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just kind of look and point and
grunt at each other and we know what we
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He watches me interact with customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows I'm going to ask for a t-shirt to
give you or he knows to pass me some
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike has been Mike has been coming to all
of the events with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been my right hand man for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows how to run my booth without me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take a break and go use the restroom
or go buy cheesecake or just go roam
[SPEAKER_00]: around at this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I just roam around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roamed around and gave away free packs of
seeds to people who looked like they could
[SPEAKER_00]: use some seeds who I'd never met before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to introduce myself and my
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just went and gave away seeds and I
had faith that Mike and Billy were holding
[SPEAKER_00]: down the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my buddy White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's becoming a really reliable booth
manager a booth dude for me and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: working very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making the events a lot more fun when
I can relax and interact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: customers that want to come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of the face of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike can keep business moving and keep
things flowing for me and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm giving people shout outs I want
to send another shout out to my dude Billy
[SPEAKER_00]: Bong Smokin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said that dude flew in from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the plane probably four times as
long as he got to hang out with me and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out from about 11 to about six
maybe five thirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got about six full hours in hanging out
with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we were working most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a retail event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started so many conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would ask a question and get started on
a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then have to stop and help whoever was
coming up to the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a problem but we started so many
conversations and did not finish a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Billy we got a lot more hanging out to
do bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big shout out to my buddy Billy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to take a step up in his
cannabis knowledge his trade show
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned a lot this weekend and met a
lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike and Billy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I want to send a gigantic shout out
to my buddy Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's groovy gravy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without Wolf these events would not
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wolf put this one on from what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed it went on without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was flawless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parking at the beginning was a little
questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got that figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flowed like a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that they got us in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got right to the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customers came.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way they did this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought tickets for a one hour time
slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were allowed to shop from noon to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sequestered you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Escorted you out to the back of the event
where there was plenty happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a band out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was plenty of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was tacos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was cheese cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was hash to be smoked out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot going on out there in the
back patio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like you were forced to
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got a one hour shopping spot
inside and then you were kind of escorted
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the outside part where you could
hang out with everybody and chill,
[SPEAKER_00]: make friends and mingle if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the event went super
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the time blocks came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the time blocks shopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left like they were supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the shopping time slots the
vendors get a 10 or 15 minute break
[SPEAKER_00]: between each wave or time slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can rearrange my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take a quick drink of whatever I'm
drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go take a piss if I need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, a lot of the time when it was a
10 minute break, I would just take a big
[SPEAKER_00]: fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a non consumption event,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allegedly I was taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different when you're a vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to kick you out when you
paid a bunch of money to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a great event and it could not
have happened without our buddy Wolf,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as Groovy Gravy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, if you ever see this, I don't know if
you watch the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you ever hear the shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an honor to be a part of the Groovy
Gravy secret stash and I hope I'm invited
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, to the best of my knowledge,
I think it's kind of like an invite only
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very minimal amounts of booth
spaces in the small venue, which we
[SPEAKER_00]: choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty full and we get basically it's
all the top notch breeders in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of an invite only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I keep my invite next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys did not make it this year,
if I'm there or not next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan your trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to choose or maybe
come out for a long week, a long month and
[SPEAKER_00]: stay for the Dude Grows Cup and the Groovy
Gravy event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all go to dinner afterward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to Mike for enduring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Mike to a vegan restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is not vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's way easy to go pick out food for
me when I just go to a vegan restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can eat everything on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike actually found some stuff he
thoroughly enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike for enduring that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do have two more people I want to
give a shout out to maybe another group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that I'd like to send shout outs to
from the Groovy Gravy event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been going on for quite a
while about that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to go bond with the community,
go see old friends, and new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm headed is shout out to Swerve
from the Cali Connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I even got completely set up,
Swerve popped out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know where he came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just right in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: You look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logo looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve was full of compliments,
very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve is the Cali Connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve and I made friends a while back
several years ago at an event at the High
[SPEAKER_00]: Times Cannabis Cup in Denver was the first
time we really hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, he's been inviting me to hang
out at his booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one couch at the Cannabis Cup in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at Swerve's booth at the Cali
Connection booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Ill, myself, and Little Kev and
Swerve sat on those couches and smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs for $4.20 at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy Swerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swerve came by and gave me a lot of
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pulled me aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a long talk about the industry,
about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see Swerve doing as well as
he can, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the health stays strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Swerve from the
Cali Connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also big shout out to JJ from Top
Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ stops by and shakes my hand every event
he sees me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're building this extra family
that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Ivy Army, but then it's also
cool to build bonds with all of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel any animosity or intimidation
or competition with any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all doing our own thing,
and I love building the relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to collab with everybody in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, speaking of collabs, I can't say too
much, but I got to see the one the only,
[SPEAKER_00]: the man, the myth, the legend,
the ghetto superstar, my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mace was at the event there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see Mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mace was a little bit under the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't hanging out as much as he could
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't want to get everybody else sick,
so I understand and respect and appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But got to see Mace, got to give him a
homey handshake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when he slap hands, you do the
fist bump thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like Mace was selling a bunch of
seeds, so shout out to Mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the other community that we're
building there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so awesome too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more excited to get there early just
to see what the crew is doing and catch
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how are you, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: What seeds have you made this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where have you been?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the industry treating you?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our own little like private
conversations before the party even
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the relationships that we're all
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that the weirdness in the community
seems to be going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a little while there was some hatred,
some jealousy, some animosity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it feels like we're really,
we are uniting, which we've all got the
[SPEAKER_00]: same fucking goal, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get good seeds out to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be chill with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my theory there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I've gone on far too long about
the Groovy Gravy Secret stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really good time and I look
forward to doing it again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you brought me seeds, flowers,
stickers, a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we took a selfie together, yo,
please post the selfies if we took one
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody, thank you for showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for making it a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it went off without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about those those time
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all went super smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the part of the podcast
which everybody loves and enjoys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the grow question and answer
portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, iregenetics.com,
there's a list of tabs on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them says questions or grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it says right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow question,
click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll down and answer the preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a general grow question,
just go ahead and type that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your grow question here on the
podcast, that means you win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here, please go
ahead and send me your shipping address
[SPEAKER_00]: with a real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also let me know what episode number
you won the seeds on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can mark that off my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am keeping track of who I send seeds to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But send me an email with your shipping
address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get you a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from the grow help tab
and it came from my friend Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big love bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message said, I think this is the
place for a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is absolutely the place bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, what are some steps you
take to sexing a new regular bean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to call you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually typed in the word sexting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your phone auto correcting shit
for bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says what's what are some steps
you take to sexing a new bean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of strains that are very
shy and do not want to show me their
[SPEAKER_00]: goody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got some plants that are some
prudes over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make these plants show you
their sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing I focus on when I'm trying
to get plants to show me their sex is an
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted 12 hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what's going to put our
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would change the timer from 12 from
either 24 hours on which a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: do or 18 hours on and six hours off,
which is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would go ahead and I would change
that timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put it on a flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 12 hours of darkness will tell the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, fall is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thinks the end of the world is near and
it wants to flower so it should go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are in this 1212 situation
for about 10 days, 14 days and they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to show you flower, I would suspect
you've got some light leaks or these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have got what we call a very strong
critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical period is the amount of
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of uninterrupted darkness which
it takes to trigger a plant to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants could be from a region on the
globe where it takes a little longer to
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most plants, the reason why we chose
1212 is because it seems to work with most
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get onto the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them 12 hours of daylight and 12
hours of uninterrupted darkness for 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should start showing you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, like I said before, I suspect a
light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting that dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably stretching more than you
want them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put the plants in 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should show you by day 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should definitely know what you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've made your determinations,
which are males or females, Cole,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed braider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I I do a female hunt just for
boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you found the boys or girls,
get rid of what you do and do not want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the rest, then return them to either
24 hours on or 18 hours on and six hours
[SPEAKER_00]: off of a lighting cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do understand that some people are
not going to want to put their little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: plant into flower and then shock it,
make it show us sex and then put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find that to be too stressful for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't want to do that,
I do have an option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg your plant from seed until it
is large enough to take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take that clone, you can then put
the clone directly into 1212 lighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone should go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said in 10 to 14, maybe 17 days at
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start showing you if it is a boy or
a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take those clones, be very
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have mentioned this already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow you can give it a number,
a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it a people name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be A32 Jack if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get as creative as you want,
but when you label that plant A32 Jack,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you label the clone that came
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A32 Jack as well so we know which is
which.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when your clone shows sex,
if you're going to toss the males like
[SPEAKER_00]: most people do, you could toss the male
clone and you could toss the big plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've just eliminated all the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones and the potted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've just got females left in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option kind of on the same boat
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg your plants out till they're
big enough to get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Jack A32.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time we're going to use Jill 52B and
we're going to take a clone of Jill 52B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to put those clones under
lighting under the 24 hour lighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to let those root.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're going to take our big
plants and put those into the flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: and flip those because we've been vegging
them for a while anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already big enough to grow and
produce a little bit and they're just the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time we're running them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to veg them too big because
they could be intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be something I'm interested
in, so let's just grow those in that
[SPEAKER_00]: original.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably in a one to three gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big enough to get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just flip those.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as those plants show you sex,
you can flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could toss the males and also go back
and toss the clones that went with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something I should mention if we go
from 1212 from seed, if you sprout seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them immediately under 1212 lighting,
it may take two or three weeks for those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to adjust their hormones to even
really go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may take you three to four weeks to
actually see the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go directly 1212 from seed,
not every plant, every strain is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, but it is very possible that it
could take a minute for those hormones to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop for the plant to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm under 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what to do yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the certain hormones, the correct
hormone will hit that plant and it'll go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 1212 lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flower so they may need a
little bit of time just to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing this straight from seed,
if the plan is grown big enough and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a clone from it, it's already
developed enough of those hormones that
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones definitely will flip right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing we're talking about here
is something called critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the amount of time that a plant
takes to decide that it needs to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of uninterrupted darkness that
that plant requires to trigger the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 1212 is the trick for most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we the general rule of thumb is
1212 that should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, like I said before, my first
suspicion is that these plants are not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that uninterrupted darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be getting a light leak again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said they're just being stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being shy and not showing you
their goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're getting that
uninterrupted darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they may just be too young to show
you their goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might may need to wait till they at
least reach a little bit of more hormonal
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll start to show you what
they've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude Terps, I'm pretty sure I know who
this message came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you another pack of seeds
because I love what you do with them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good wording here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to leave that in the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great more messages that I've
got here in the pile comes from a person
[SPEAKER_00]: who wants to be called Potcasso or Potty
O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me two names to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling frisky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this one, my friend, we're going
to call you Potcasso.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me a real name and a
shipping address because like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: before, I owe you a free pack of seeds
because I'm going to read your message
[SPEAKER_00]: right here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, thank you for all
you do, especially the education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned everything I know from you,
the iry army and the dude grow show,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for supporting the iry army and
also big shout out to the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I love your work and your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are bringing the knowledge and the
fire to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says my question is how often
would you defoliate when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: scrogging?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a two trellis system in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is to fill the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the first one to spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get those chunky colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that second one to hold them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great strategy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is there a particular time and
frequency you defoliate your personal or
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically handle defoliation the same
and a personal and commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether I'm growing for seeds or flowers
or whatever, I basically do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: method, schedule and strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my place to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've seen other recommendations of
heavy leaf strips the week before flip at
[SPEAKER_00]: day 21 and at day 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, dude, that's a great strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very close to what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says personally, I clean up the skirt
and any potential bud sites the week
[SPEAKER_00]: before flip and then nothing till day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lollipop to my first trellis and then
only a light cleanup again for blocked bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sites and heavy leaf on leaf areas for
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it pretty close to how I
would do it, but I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got notes, so we'll talk about that
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read the rest of what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says periodically I'll take a leaf or
two when necessary until week 10 where I
[SPEAKER_00]: strip her bald headed into harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I love a pre harvest strip that we
just get all those leaves off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the lights off, come back the next
day, chop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have as much junk to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He finishes up with I love going 186 week
10 of flower bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying that because so many
people are skeptical and so many people
[SPEAKER_00]: have sent me basically hate mail and told
me that I'm ridiculous and wild and crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically retarded for recommending to
go 18 hours on and six hours off at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed the people that have tried it
fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that tries it sends me a message
and they say hey bro, I tried this fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who haven't tried it tell me
I'm fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that I notice about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thank you for trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having faith in me and thank
you for saying that it is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the next cycle and an attempt to
really try to maximize potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a main line into a Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't really fuck with the main
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fill that Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry too much about the main line
Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will be happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main line.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main line to me is for people who were
only allowed to have one plant and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't have shit to do all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're doing as much as they possibly
can to that one single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I feel about mainlining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot of work to one plant when
what you've done with one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: mainlining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have done that with the whole
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Scrogging it, trellising it,
popping, twisting and cropping it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got one plant, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got all day, but I don't have all
day to fuck with one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on a much larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says any recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the defoliation
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps it up with take a fat dab
and give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, that's my line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I say now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to say at the end of the
show?
[SPEAKER_00]: You stole my line, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main question here is about
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you do it a week before
flip, which is basically I would do it the
[SPEAKER_00]: day of flip mainly because just strategy
for the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier for me to defoliate in the
bigger room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do start defoliating a little bit in
veg, but not heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some of the giant leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will come off and veg then day one
of flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a nice defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then basically, like you said,
you said day 21 and 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's basically what I would do two
weeks in about four weeks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But about two weeks in is when I do the
shave and the lollipopping and a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: de-leafing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flip it, do a de-leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a major, but a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then two weeks in, I'll do a major
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shave the legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do some defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a bunch of popping and twisting
and a lot of working into the canopy if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything is getting too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week two is really when I go kind of
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it again at week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do continue all the way up into
week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see shit down there underneath the
canopy that just doesn't look good,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not going to trim that shit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to pull that off and let it
actually put that energy, that feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients, that love somewhere else
in the plant up top where it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: worth trimming is basically what I'm
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I really wanted to
mention was, I don't like to do one super
[SPEAKER_00]: hard defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, I kind of come from a
commercial cultivation background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a room, let's just say a
hundred foot by a hundred foot room with a
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say five or eight hundred
plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing and making shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go in and super hard defoliate
one section.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is I would set a timer and
I would try to spend, I would divide the
[SPEAKER_00]: day in quarters and make sure that I did a
quarter of the day on this part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and a quarter over here and a quarter
here and a quarter here so that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have one section that's heavily defoliated
and the rest looks like the seventies
[SPEAKER_00]: bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather go around the room multiple
times and take off light layers every time
[SPEAKER_00]: around the room and just continuously do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than just go take, if we got
multiple tables, that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just say don't go strip that table
naked, strip all the tables at level two,
[SPEAKER_00]: then come back and strip all the tables to
level four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just do one section at level fucking
eight right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go lightly all the way around the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just creates a better airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates less microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more even and it's better for your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also you just see the progress
differently instead of getting all these
[SPEAKER_00]: naked and then going, I got all that left
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, oh, we kind of got part of the
whole room and you get to move around the
[SPEAKER_00]: room instead of being in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put on a podcast, put on some
music and just defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could defoliate all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very Zen for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pulling the big pedials, seeing how
many big ass trash bags or five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets of leaves I pulled just feels real
good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I'm accomplishing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, it feels like you've got the
right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no, uh, no right or wrong way to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pulling too many leaves,
that is the only wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to tell cause the
plants will slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're doing it a week before day 21
and day 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go day one, day 21 and day 42,
basically, um, give them that good leg
[SPEAKER_00]: shaving, give them the lolly popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think you're doing everything just
about perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any popping and twisting,
um, some super cropping that may be the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing that you may need to implement
in your Scrog game.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude pot Casso or potty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, toker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the two names, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's three names I got here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give my mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, here's a reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your shipping address
with a real name and also a reminder of
[SPEAKER_00]: what episode you did win the free seeds
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could scroll back, see that I do
actually owe you prizes guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to scam me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're better at this than you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great message here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called daft punks luggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a heavy task right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got helmets and dance gear in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's stay focused here on the
podcast daft punks luggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, I owe you a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I've said before, please send me
your real name with a shipping address and
[SPEAKER_00]: also remind me what episode number I read
your message on and I will send you a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question from our friend daft punks
luggage goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know the difference between f1s,
f2s, f3s, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just filial generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says each being a new filial generation
selected from a mating pair from the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so it sounds like you do
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says theoretically each generation is
getting closer to stabilization if good
[SPEAKER_00]: selections are made by the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that does all make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what do you see when you self with
silver thiosulfate using a strong female
[SPEAKER_00]: from each generation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very, very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you have mentioned in previous
episodes that you have seen greater
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in f2s more of the grandma and
grandpa than and some weirdos than you do
[SPEAKER_00]: in the f1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this prove true through selfing f2s
as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have stumbled through reading that,
but that is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to explain what this person is
asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were breeding regular seeds with
male and female seeds, the second filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generation often shows what we call
transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we will see is we will see progeny
that outperform both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also see representative
representations of the grandma on both
[SPEAKER_00]: sides and the grandpa on both sides and
possibly weird recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2 is kind of like the Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of open up a lot of weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: F3 is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also f4.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start mellow and shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you're at f5, you're getting a
lot more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do talk about the f2 showing a lot
more phenotypical variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us are into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see that weird shit that I can
find in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys don't like it,
but that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that weird wildness that comes from
the f2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they are asking if I were to take an
f2, one of those f2s that came from that
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of seeds, and reverse that one and
self it, am I going to find as wild
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypical variants in that f2
if I make in that s1 from that f2?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a bunch of different numbers
there, but it does make sense if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: following along.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple answer to that is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to find as many different
phenotypical variations and variances
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have not really introduced
anything to unlock Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just taking one plant and I'm just
taking its chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the pollen from that and
putting it back on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to replicate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to take a female from that f2
and take another female from that same
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation and not self it,
but reverse it and put the pollen on a
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotype, at that point,
I may see more phenotypical variants than
[SPEAKER_00]: I would normally do with the selfing or a
reverse project, but I think that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way to open up that weirdness
again is if I put it on a different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or if I pollinated one of those reversals
with something from another generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I think the short answer of what
I'm trying to say is no, we will not see
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild phenotypical variation if we were
to s1 and f2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're following along with
breeding class, that does make perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the reason I ask I like that
you've got a reason for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I just bought a pack of yours and
subcooled Jack the Ripper f2 number four
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm interested in exploring the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I should open pollinate the
group to improve my chances of getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: winner or should I call the males and then
self the best looking female to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: she has in her?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all about how much time,
how much space, how much energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you really want to do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done, in my opinion, I've done a
pretty good selection on this breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the Jack the Ripper f2 number
fours are really good seeds, so you will
[SPEAKER_00]: find a good winner in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a female in that batch that
meets the criteria you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have all the Jack the Ripper traits,
the limey dryer sheet flavor, the head
[SPEAKER_00]: ripping buzz, the strong growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have all of that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to open pollinate that to take
it to the f3, you will make something
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a really fun step to take
these seeds, but that will take more time,
[SPEAKER_00]: space and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to select the female,
you've still got to grow out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you've still got to find the winner
female, you got to call the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you probably could have
just done the open pollination project
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, so why not do both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not veg them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get clones of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, you'll see the female in
there that stands out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice, even though it's
pollinated, you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be visually appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll smell great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know what the keeper out of that
project is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have faith in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take clones of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select your favorite female out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a clone of her and backup in
the clone machine or in the clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make two clones of your favorite keeper
and then do the selfing project again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in a fucking ideal world in a
fantasy land right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which would be best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two totally different projects
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do the open pollination with the
entire pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got probably five males and five
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tossing all those Jack the Ripper
genetics around, you'll make some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you've got the option to do selective
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pick your favorite male and
favorite female, breed those together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a selectively bred F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: The open pollination will also be F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just call it open pollination F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would call that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selective breeding would be better for
the F3, but your other option there is to
[SPEAKER_00]: find your favorite female and self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of those sound like very fun
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: For their own reason, I don't want to
decide for you which one you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of asking which one should I
do, but should I call the males and then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would do them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a five year project,
but I would do all this shit if I were
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I do have a plant count limit and
I would love to grow 100 plants to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: proper phenohunt, but I have kids and that
is that I'm going to stay within the
[SPEAKER_00]: bounds of the law, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is respectable and respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not write this down, but let me jump
in and talk about something here that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do a phenohunt and you've got
a small plant count and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time or the ability to sift through a
large population of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in an area where my plant count is
limited to 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got a podcast, a seed company,
and five foot long dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in my city knows who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure law enforcement knows who
I am by this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not go over my plant count because
they would love to make an example of me
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only able to do 10 or 12 plant
phenohunts at a time just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I work through 100 seeds is I
will start 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something doesn't look right in the
beginning, I immediately toss that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those mutants are winners,
but if I'm breeding and doing certain
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, I know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get rid of the boys if I'm not
looking for boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point I took 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably narrowed them down to five
before we get like into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll flower those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they go into flower,
if I popped, if I got five in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room, I germinate five more immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm back at my plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I wasting numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to pop more seeds to
replace those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of those five, I'll probably keep
one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got five more coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to pop more seeds until
I've got one or two more keepers and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: only grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have five keepers and
germinate five more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to pick my favorite two out
of these five and I'm going to eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: the other three and just start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like a bracket system
casting couch audition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow 10 more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that top one out of that one to
the other top one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a battle royale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bracket system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep going and replacing as I find
something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do a small pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the email does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says if I could have a fully female
population that would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could get the same results or better
results from using your STS recipe and
[SPEAKER_00]: selfing a strong female from the
population, that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it sounds like you've came up with
part of the answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want all female seeds because it would
be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point I would say grow out the
entire pack and find your favorite female
[SPEAKER_00]: and then self her and make your own
feminized seeds out of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a really fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like the best bet for you
maybe to make these fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that strategy would be to veg out
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a clone from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them all into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you identify males,
get rid of the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the male clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop those clones as soon as they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have them on reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now your backup keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your genetic preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow out the plants that you've got in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your favorite females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your favorite female and make your
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got backup clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toss everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accept your favorite one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make two clones of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're on to the selfing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to treat one with the silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pollinate the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have just done your selection
and made your Jack the Ripper F2S1s for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the fun part of that is growing them
and seeing the variation that does come
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get that wild
variation like when you cross male and
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're definitely not going to get that
wild F2 variation, but you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see some of what made the
Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the dad and you're going to get a
bunch of phenotypes that look just like
[SPEAKER_00]: that female that you selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend daft punks luggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got quite rambly on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of good details to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to knowing what you decide
to do with this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go with the open
pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go with selective
breeding or are you going to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized project?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds kind of like the the open
pollination and the femme project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a minute ago would work hand
in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got to do the phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just do the open pollination while
you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make so many fun seeds to play with
and then then you can take your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: one out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original batch and you can self that
then also you can grow out all those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and find your favorite from that batch
that you made and then you can self that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make an F3 S1 also then then do
some plan then just start back crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: and going back in circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a lot of fun with that if you
just open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a plant with potential and a
plant with potential put them bitches
[SPEAKER_00]: together or line breed parallel lines and
then breed them together in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you full permission to play with
the Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given full permission by Miss Jill
to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory is once I make a seed I have no
right in saying what you do with it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've paid for it if you bought it or
acquired it ethically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stole it piss off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you didn't but I'm just saying if
you got those seeds in an ethical manner I
[SPEAKER_00]: have no control over what you do with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a bunch of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you got some more free seeds coming
your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I've said before please send me a
real name and a shipping address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you out a free pack of irie
genetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has sent me a message
and I have not read it on the show please
[SPEAKER_00]: do not feel discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a mountain of questions here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working my way through them the best I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get three or four per episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did ramble quite a bit through this one
question so we only covered three in this
[SPEAKER_00]: show but that's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll read your question on the next
episode.
