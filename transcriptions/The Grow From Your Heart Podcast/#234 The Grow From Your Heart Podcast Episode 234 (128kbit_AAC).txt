[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming to you, it's about 7,
10 PM, so everyone's sitting here taking
[SPEAKER_01]: some fat dabs at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me introduce to you our super
photography expert, our dab master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just making shit up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our cannabis photography guide for
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my good buddy, Joe, to my left.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, it's great having you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming to the... The studio
doesn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to make up a name for this very
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming to my dining room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the Eyre dining room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Eyre table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to call it Sticky Knob Studios a
long time ago, and somebody told me that
[SPEAKER_01]: that just sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's because there's hash all over
everything now after taking so many dabs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but ladies and gentlemen, directly in
front of me also here joining us on
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone is my good buddy, Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing well, doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're all a little bit high,
so there may be some giggles here in this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, but it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since we're talking about dabs,
this is a good time to give a big shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to our friend, Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy calls himself Bobo Blaster Co on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a website.

[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sit at a coffee table,
and Slop and I were sitting at the coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: table taking dabs, just chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it beautiful?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a sexy table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I really appreciate you sending me

[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get you all of the information that
you need to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's enough ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, let's get down to business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited my good buddy Joe over because
we want to learn a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, I got to give you a compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take really great cannabis pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: You called me an expert before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm no expert.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just an enthusiast who has had a
camera for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the modesty there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely like being corrected on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, he's our enthusiast with a lot of
experience here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we'll call him, not an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, take everything he has with a grain of
salt, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust you and respect your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's why I brought you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Slop's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to chime in once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to do this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to have another fat dab
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to record an episode
featuring our good buddy Slop over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's jump into the photography with
our good buddy who is almost an expert in
[SPEAKER_01]: my opinion, Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want to do is improve the
listener's photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I just say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, what we want to do is improve
their photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess the main thing that I'll start
with is what you guys need to do is think
[SPEAKER_01]: about why are you shooting photography?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to do it for advertising,
are you going to do it for magazine shots,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are you simply just trying to be cool
on social media and get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: followers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's going to make a huge
difference in a lot of the equipment that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's pretty much what I came up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wanted to ask Joe if he could
elaborate on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also if he could help us select a
camera for our purpose and possibly that
[SPEAKER_01]: fits our budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make any sense to you,
bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're doing the social media thing,
stick with your phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your phone is an amazing device,
you know, nine megapixels, 10 megapixels,
[SPEAKER_08]: even more than some.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as you have the proper lighting,
that phone will do everything that you
[SPEAKER_08]: need.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the point and shoot, if you're a
blogger, somebody who's taking pictures of
[SPEAKER_08]: food or friends, little videos here and
there, even if you're filming YouTube
[SPEAKER_08]: videos, point and shoot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a point and shoot two to $500,
$600 if you want to really go crazy on
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can get an amazing blog worthy
internet work.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get an amazing blog worthy camera,
all the capabilities that you need.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if, like you said, advertising
and really, really want nice pictures,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can put them on blogs too,
certainly no limits.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you must have the camera quality,
the top camera quality in all aspects,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's definitely the DSLR, a digital
single lens reflex camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there will not be a test,
so you don't have to try to remember that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Joe proved the point right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about what you're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just trying to be on Instagram,
if you're going blogging, you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to spend a million dollars on all of your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just trying to shoot some
Instagram pictures, if you're trying to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a Twitter guy, if you're doing Facebook,
you can use your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the new iPhones, the Samsung
phones, my iPhone 6 takes amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the new phones, you can get really
quality pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into lighting in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to be, you know,
I've had a magazine shot and I did not use
[SPEAKER_01]: a super expensive camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a $200 camera for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's not all about the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is about the settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is about the lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is about learning where to
shoot from, and maybe a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: editing, but we'll get into that more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, select a camera that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the best camera you can for your
budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first bought my camera,
I was intimidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a point and shoot camera,
and I feel like I almost, I didn't waste
[SPEAKER_01]: the $200, but if I would have put that
money toward my nice DSLR camera in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, I would be further in shooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be intimidated by a camera with a
lot of settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the new DSLRs, I think all of
them, have an auto setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you can learn through that auto
setting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most all new cameras are extremely
user-friendly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Manufacturers know who they're making
cameras for.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know what their audience is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you've never used, as long as
you're technology capable, as long as you,
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, be technology capable, buy any
camera you want, and you will be able to
[SPEAKER_08]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not on your own through
experimenting, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, YouTube is always a good resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just type in this camera, and then the
question you have about it, and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: pop up 17 videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And watch a couple of them and filter out
the bullshit, because every one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys is going to tell you some weird thing
that is unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just watch three videos and figure
out, and do the math on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the median.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, figure out why you're going to shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Select the best camera you can for your
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to go shooting for
Instagram, don't buy a thousand dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy the D30 for Instagram shots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you can afford it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if you want the best pictures on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will have the best, probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want the crispest.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a word.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want the crispest pictures
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times do we have to say a word to
make it a word around here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't take long.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, then select and get the best camera
you can, you guys, and then learn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, while you're shopping,
there are a couple of accessories that we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about this a little bit before.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are definitely some accessories that
we would all recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're shopping, get your self a
tripod.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get a cheap tripod.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are tripods out there for 20 and 30
dollars, which will work, but they're
[SPEAKER_08]: plastic, and they're soft, and they're not
meant to last, and they're not meant to
[SPEAKER_08]: really be hauled around and that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're not going to haul it around
and you're just going to leave it in one
[SPEAKER_08]: place and take pictures, always buy that
20 or 30 dollar one.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the difference between a 30 dollar
tripod and a 70 dollar tripod is giant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's metal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very sturdy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to last forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will last as many cameras as you could
buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ruined my 30 dollar tripod quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The height adjustment stripped out,
so it's stuck at one height.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to move it up, I got to like
yank it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I've got the 70 dollar Dynex one that
they have at Best Buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, great investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tripod will make your pictures,
your photos will be not wobbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to leave the shutter open a
little bit longer because you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: holding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter how steady you think you
are, you're shaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way physics works, think about
like a flashlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you turn the flashlight, you make a
nice arc with the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing that with the lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not just wobbling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're waving the whole end of the lens
because the part that's shooting is
[SPEAKER_01]: wiggling in a much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's you're making a cone shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that's science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, get yourself a nice case.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get a bag, a soft bag or a case
or something for the camera, do that
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're going to want to carry
extra lenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to carry a lens
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a little soft cloth to clean off
the lens, especially when shooting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lens is freaking sticky all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to clean it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get too close to the plants or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just you touch it and then it
trichomes all over your lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Old cotton t-shirts, nothing wrong with
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No socks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use a sock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually a fresh sock.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything that's soft, you know,
don't use like anything soft.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to tell you what not to use,
but it's really okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't press too hard to scratch up the
lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally like to go to the
sunglasses store and get that little rag
[SPEAKER_01]: that they use to clean your sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microfiber cloths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, microfiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that works perfect for my camera
lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't skimp on the case either.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cases, backpacks, you know, a $70,
$100 case, you know, you're putting a
[SPEAKER_08]: thousand dollar camera in it maybe and a
thousand dollar lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what's a hundred dollar case
versus a $50 case that gets thrown at the
[SPEAKER_08]: airport or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all about initial investment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pelican case is not too shabby,
especially if you're traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the best way to not get your
camera stolen out of your vehicle when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're traveling, cover it up,
hang it on your neck and take pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: with you while you're running around,
take the damn thing with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The craziest shit happens when you don't
have your camera with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can like almost guarantee you're not
going to get robbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get jacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be a catastrophe if you've got
your camera on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't save Anthony Jumia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the greatest reference on this
podcast, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Opie and Anthony.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get yourself a good tripod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a good camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some lenses now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of lenses for shooting cannabis
photography?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you recommend a few lenses?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to give any like specific
lens to get just because everybody,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, I don't want it to be bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you say, oh, this guy said that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's, are you trying to take pictures
of trichomes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you trying to take pictures of buds
off the plant, on the plant?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to take pictures of the whole
plant?
[SPEAKER_08]: Different lenses are going to do different
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get, you know, shorter focal
length plants or plants of shorter focal
[SPEAKER_08]: length lenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: For portraits and that's just really
general.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get all different, there's all
different kinds of lenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each camera is going to have different
lenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each brand is going to have different
lenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're just talking about DSLRs right
now, because that's the only thing that
[SPEAKER_08]: lenses really apply to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your lens and you're buying your lens and
your body separate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you're buying them in a box
together, it's set.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting that for a reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're buying the body that you want,
because the body has all the features that
[SPEAKER_08]: you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the lens, because that lens has
all the features that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it says body only, they're sending
me a usable camera with no lens,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's misleading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know anything about that when I
was camera shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what the hell does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Body only.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if there were mechanics inside of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's misleading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that like just the plastic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that said, you can certainly get
lenses that fit all applications.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get like the telephoto lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's telephoto and telemacro.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I use, just as the easy lens for all
aspects, I use it, I think it's an 18 to
[SPEAKER_08]: 200.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Nikon lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a nice range.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a huge range.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that fits anything that you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to take a picture of a mountain,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to take a picture of a tricone,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the 55 to 200 in my case right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's... This is my go-to lens right
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the one I use quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that you need it to do without
getting too specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, what I use, since Joe approves of
my setup here, I'm using the Nikon D3200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bought the package that comes with
the case and the two lenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually use the 55 to 200 lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I want to get in there,
sometimes it's hard to maneuver around the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't back up from the plant,
if you're up close, then I'll switch to
[SPEAKER_01]: the...
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the right number so I don't
mislead anybody here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 18 to 55 is the one I use when I
can't maneuver around the room too well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm further away, I go for this longer
lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm close and tight, I use the 18 to
55.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get much better shots with this 55 to
200 lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my go-to right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we're saying all of this,
basically to take the macro shots on that
[SPEAKER_08]: 55 to 200, you put it all the way to 200
and on a tripod, and you're going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: about 18, 20 inches away from the NUG with
your 200 zoomed all the way out into that
[SPEAKER_08]: NUG.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how you're getting your macro
shots in that specific... Zoomed all the
[SPEAKER_08]: way out or all the way in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're zoomed into what you're
trying to...
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 200?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your 200 is extended as far as it will go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You set it to 200.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the lens is out and on your viewfinder,
it's zoomed in on your subject.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that's where you find your macro
setting in that lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's in these types of lenses that
do everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've been off the mic for so much
of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, I've got you up loud enough so I
think we can get you in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are mics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are lenses that do everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to take pictures of just
trichomes, really close up things going on
[SPEAKER_08]: in your garden, you could take awesome
pictures of soil, who knows what you'll
[SPEAKER_08]: find in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could take pictures of whole NUGs,
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to get a dedicated macro lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that won't take pictures of
mountains, something that won't take
[SPEAKER_08]: pictures of your family, no portraits.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just little tiny stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just little things.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the right lens for the right job is
kind of what you're trying to say.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do your research.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look for something that's going to shoot
in five to one.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all about full resolution on big
prints, essentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if you have an eight by 11 picture of
a trichome and it's perfectly in focus and
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful, that's because somebody was
using like a five to one lens that would
[SPEAKER_08]: allow you to shoot that whole frame.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're zoomed into lifelike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're zoomed into real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically people got to know what
they're aiming for and that can lead us
[SPEAKER_01]: into another part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to kind of skip a little part
of the notes that we made, but instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: just, no, no, I like it when it flows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting so off track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one skipping it because I like the
way that it's flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It flows better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just shooting at random shit,
kind of plan out your shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since Joe's talking about your lens,
you're going to have to know what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: aiming for when you put this lens on your
camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go putting on your macro lens
and then try to take a picture of the top
[SPEAKER_01]: cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get your 200 lens out to take
pictures of the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of know what you're aiming for,
plan your shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about, like Joe said, if you want to
take a picture of a trichome or if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to take a picture of some soil,
think about it and you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you walk through the grow room,
something will go right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it catches your eye, that means
it catches the camera and try to stand
[SPEAKER_01]: where you were when it got your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to replicate that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be scared to take a lot of pictures
of even the same thing and then there'll
[SPEAKER_07]: be that one that's just like, this is the
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have the time to, I don't know,
take some dabs and look through your
[SPEAKER_07]: pictures, do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The magic of memory cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not wasting film anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just clicking away on a memory card.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're wasting RAM and we can delete it all
and do it all over again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plan out your shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose the right lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: For your shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to make a correction on that,
with the 200, the 55 to 200, when you're
[SPEAKER_08]: at 200, I don't want anybody to think that
you can take a picture of a trichome with
[SPEAKER_08]: the 200.
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't work that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was kind of thinking that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can take a picture, you can take
really close up good shots of nugs on your
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can take where you will see each
individual trichome as a dot, sometimes
[SPEAKER_08]: the stalk, just depending on how good the
lighting is, but don't think you're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to get that real super official macro
photography without a macro specific lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wrote something down to try not to
forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go into lighting next
because you just hinted on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you guys, one huge hint I can give you
just super quickly, get yourself either a
[SPEAKER_01]: Method 7 lens or- Oh, I totally forgot
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we both forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get your, it's either, or you can just
put the sunglasses right over your camera
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're ghetto.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Method 7 makes a filter that cuts out the
HID, the high intensity discharge light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cuts that color out and you can see the
natural color of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not able to take the plants
out of the room, the Method 7 lens is a
[SPEAKER_01]: good way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's work into lighting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How should we be lighting our cannabis
plants when we're taking pictures?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideally not around HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even T5 lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not true light.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's super white.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks good, but it's not the true
representation of your plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It puts a little bit of a blue to it,
I've noticed.
Certainly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could put any hue on it just depending
on the other lights in the room or a
[SPEAKER_08]: number of factors.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: What it's reflecting from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So your lighting, what's easiest?
[SPEAKER_08]: Get in a room with really good outside
lighting or a whole bunch of CFLs.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're pretty flat white, easy to color
balance off of your camera if you want to
[SPEAKER_08]: get into your settings and do that,
but that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't have that and you have to
stay in your grow room, turn the HPS
[SPEAKER_08]: lights off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just turn your overhead light on and
use a flash.
[SPEAKER_08]: A flash will overcome a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the stock flash that came on most of
our DSL cameras going to be DSLR cameras?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be good enough or should
we get like a ring, like an aftermarket
[SPEAKER_01]: flash?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can afford an aftermarket flash,
it is going to be a lot far superior to
[SPEAKER_08]: the one built in, but that one that's
built in is not too shabby either.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will definitely get the job done for
most applications.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're getting an aftermarket flash,
you should really know why you're about to
[SPEAKER_08]: spend $160 on a flash.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's reasons for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to tell you what they are
because that's cheating.
[SPEAKER_08]: Figure out the reason.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll get to some reasons later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So more lighting is usually the key,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: More lighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: More lighting, the better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunlight, if you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunlight's the most ideal, but I know
everybody can't take their plants outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite meme is the old lady looking
out the window and it says, there's my
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor taking pictures of his bongs in
the sunlight again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it on Instagram all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do because I follow usually pot
plants, glass and pit bulls as my
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some boobies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to get back on track slot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote down settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of settings should I throw my,
is it cool to just walk in there on auto
[SPEAKER_01]: and just start auto firing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be useful.
[SPEAKER_08]: They might not be the best, but they
certainly will be usable compared to if
[SPEAKER_08]: you just throw it in manual without
knowing anything, it'll probably just be
[SPEAKER_08]: black.
[SPEAKER_08]: But settings, when you don't have ideal,
I'd say throw it in auto for the most of
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason to not use auto.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have great lighting, auto is the
best setting just because it'll
[SPEAKER_08]: continually correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will just make everything easy and
pretty, and you can focus on taking the
[SPEAKER_08]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you're not getting paid,
you don't need to be 1000% perfect on
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're just for your Instagram feed,
you don't need to be all critical about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you want to be critical,
more power to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the art if you're into
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So settings are going to be for if you
want to take pictures in the dark,
[SPEAKER_08]: just using flash randomly to overcome the
HPS, or when the HPSs are on, and you have
[SPEAKER_08]: to change the setting in your camera to
filter out that on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to change settings,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something you're going to have to
learn to do with the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I've just recently
accepted, is that every shot I may have to
[SPEAKER_01]: change a setting or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it was going to be that
way when I started taking photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I could just go in there and put
it on, put the aperture setting here,
[SPEAKER_01]: turn the ISO to here, put the white
balance here, and just go in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot from every angle, and it would be
legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to take all the pictures you want
to take without moving, basically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stand in one spot, take all the pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to take, move to the next spot,
take all the pictures you want to take and
[SPEAKER_08]: do it systematically.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm not trying to tell anybody
what to do, but that's what I find,
[SPEAKER_08]: especially when you're going through your
pictures and everything is grouped.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you're going to be sitting down,
standing up, leaning over, leaning
[SPEAKER_08]: backwards in one spot without moving too
much.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really get a good feel of what that
angle is bringing to the table.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't be afraid to take weird angles,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best shots are really weird
angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang off of a ladder upside down,
backwards, and take a picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good shit comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about settings a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got lighting, we got lens selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy brought up a great point earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slop asked me, what is acceptable editing
for cannabis photography?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joe had a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you give that answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just don't edit maliciously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that, Joe means, like myself,
I'm a seed breeder, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to edit the photos I take of the
plants that come from my seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it would be misleading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I edit out the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I edit out people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I edit out other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's another plant next to it,
I'll go ahead and blur that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't edit the subject at all most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 99% of my Instagram and my website
are all unedited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are edited, you can tell
because it's black and white or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something awkward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in there making the pistols
pink and you're trying to sell a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and those pistols weren't pink,
that's what we'll call malicious editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing it for art,
like if you're doing it for like this
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful cannabis plant, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're trying to take credit for
growing this beautiful plant, don't go
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking with the colors of misleading
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to trick anyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Editing is a lot of fun though.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are certain instances when you
have to edit, like if you weren't,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, you're not always in the best
condition for pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't always have the best opportunity
to take a picture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you just have to snap,
snap, snap, snap.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to brighten it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you got to come back to some
Photoshop and clean it up.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is acceptable at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on what you're doing with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that you've learned how to select a
camera, you've got all your accessories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You figured out what kind of lenses you're
going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a cool light to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been tweaking on the camera
settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learned how to do some editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to get in a grow room or
wherever your plants are and just take a
[SPEAKER_01]: shitload of pictures, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take pictures, change the settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play with the settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, don't be afraid to
get out of auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get out of auto mode, I like to
take pictures in auto and then take a note
[SPEAKER_01]: on what auto did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto will say everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto put the ISO at this or the white
balance or the shutter speed or the
[SPEAKER_01]: aperture setting was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto will take a note for you in the photo
if you save it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then look at that note and then write
that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you've got a really killer
picture, try to duplicate that setting in
[SPEAKER_01]: that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then remember like when I was in this
setting, this environment last time I
[SPEAKER_01]: threw on this setting and I took really
killer pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll start making mental notes
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just, it'll start coming naturally
to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really nifty.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that it did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it shows on the camera, if you save it,
if you've got a decent camera,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good expensive camera, it'll show you
what the settings were when you take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, a lot of those cameras
are also putting GPS locations in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to go turn that setting off in
your camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys turn off your, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geo location is the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shut that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No good metadata in your camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then go take pictures,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just start planning out better
shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start shooting more and then you'll
learn how to set it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll learn how to get to a better
setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll learn how to plan out your shot,
frame your shot, and then you'll learn
[SPEAKER_01]: more how to edit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think that'll put you on the
way to making amazing photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have 17 to 25 to 55,000
followers on Instagram and you can be in
[SPEAKER_01]: the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take notes when you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slop, how many Instagram followers do you
have over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have like 1,734.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slop's killing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when you moved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've gone a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've covered all of the notes
that I have written down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that Joe's got a little,
what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullet point thing over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing really that I would want to
say is use the internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an amazing resource for everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, anything that you want to learn
about anything, especially photography is
[SPEAKER_08]: out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people who have blogs and
YouTube channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a guy that calls himself FROGROS,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a YouTube channel on photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of photographers are kind of stale
to watch because they're good at
[SPEAKER_01]: photography and not personal presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But FROGROS is definitely educational and
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just find somebody that you can watch and
watch them work.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can learn a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a crash course sometimes on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just show you exactly what you want
to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slop, you got anything to say over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You look blazed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be scared to use your imagination
and just get in the grow room and get down
[SPEAKER_07]: on one knee or look at it from a weird
angle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take pictures from inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really get in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The possibilities for pictures are
endless.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your imagination is the only limit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, and imagination is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got a great podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should start wrapping this up while
we're ahead, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Surely.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we're going to be back in a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do another episode with
Sloppy, and then I've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: other things planned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to wrap up the show and take
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.

shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you'd think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what you guys can get through.

[SPEAKER_01]: It's Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Instagram under iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm so addicted to Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody in this room is addicted
to Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope is an app for your iPhone or
your Android device.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking about it quite heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to take the needle out
at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a good nod.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go on Periscope once or twice a day and
just ramble on about random shit that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give words of wisdom and I also just
talk about growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I slay trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, check that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I slay the trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my troll-proof panties on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better not say all that because I just
challenge people to leave comments and
[SPEAKER_01]: send them troll-proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to get dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming for you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no stopping this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the ban hammer, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, brother?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing well, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, stoner people?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, stoner people, stoner dudes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And stoner stonets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the people that don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys that are just listening in to
learn about cannabis and get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of insight into our world here in
Colorado, I appreciate you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to read a quick ad because
of course we got to pay for one sponsor
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to you by my good
friends at HighGrowth and our growing
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you give a big high five to
Burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell everybody there that Rasta Jeff sent
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, if you guys are interested in
sponsoring the show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all the information that you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough for the technical ads and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, the reason we have
gathered here today
[SPEAKER_07]: is because we're going to be talking about
a lot of stuff that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like I hold the door for people and
they're like, should I walk through?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'm not going to slam it on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, what are you doing?
Right now.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's, he's growing a little bit of a
fuzzy hairdo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as long as I've ever seen his hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to let the man get called
out on that, but I got no issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fro is strong in this one,
but Slop looks like a straight criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're not going to get too deep into
it, but Slop, he does have a history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Slop has moved to Colorado and I've
heard a lot about Slop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know about Slop's past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where he's come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to tell you the truth, man,
since I've known you, you've been nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: but a respectful, respectable,
fucking generous, honest dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so- Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fist bump across the table here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if any of you guys need a dab,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Joe's hanging out over here,
kind of quiet, kind of listening in,
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll chime in when he's got something
worth saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you guys need a dab, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll slide the dabs over here at the end
of reach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always with dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I was telling everybody how much
of a criminal you are and how much,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I finally meet you, you're fucking
respectful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would never assume that I had any kind
of, besides just stereotyping,
[SPEAKER_07]: like tattoos and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're wearing a white beater and some
shorts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we can't be seen right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, besides stereotyping,
like just from appearance, the way that I
[SPEAKER_07]: present myself, you wouldn't really assume
that I had any past experience with
[SPEAKER_07]: organizations or just criminal activity at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: But man, the main thing I want to talk
about is just really like how much has
[SPEAKER_07]: changed being able to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I started smoking weed back in
fifth grade.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the age that you are in fifth
grade.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just an asshole.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to a minority school.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not a minority.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was integrated into a minority school
and put in the paper and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was fifth grade through 12th grade
in one school.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I used to walk home with all the older
kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't say any names, but shout out to
who you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, you know, the neighborhood was
right behind the school.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we walk home and they always smoked
every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one day they were just like,
do you want to smoke too?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't even know it was bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen other people smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really know the difference
between what people are smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember that day we smoked a blunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went and sat in their shed and played
Sega Genesis for like two hours until my
[SPEAKER_07]: mom got off work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they never brought up anything being
wrong until right when my mom was going to
[SPEAKER_07]: get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they looked at me and said,
tell her you have a headache and go to
[SPEAKER_07]: your room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't eat anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that was the daily routine after
that forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've always had to hide smoking weed
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a paraphernalia charge for a roach,
literally just a roach in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I'm from, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're assholes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: They came to a house.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were serving a warrant.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smelled marijuana, came in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was the only white person there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was like two bongs in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the police came up to me and they were
like, oh, these must be yours because
[SPEAKER_07]: you're white.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I looked at them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, actually, I smoke blunts
instead of just being like, I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: because, you know, I'm an asshole.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they walked over to the ashtray.
[SPEAKER_07]: They grabbed a roach, dropped in in front
of me and said paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is still to this day on my record.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a felony or a misdemeanor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that there's only two levels of
charges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like misdemeanor felony because felonies
are in there with like rapists and
[SPEAKER_07]: murderers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's messed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like in North Carolina, you can get a
felony.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they changed it now, but when I
was growing up, anything over a half ounce
[SPEAKER_07]: of marijuana was a felony.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd be put in with a rape?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for having some weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put Joe in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I think you can have an ounce and
a half, which still isn't shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can have a pound and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But marijuana really gave me an out from
where I was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I was in Colorado, I was in a
camper that was like 10 by 10 with no
[SPEAKER_07]: insulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had nails coming through the roof and I
literally ran an extension cord from the
[SPEAKER_07]: camper to somebody's well, because you
know, at the well they have the outlets
[SPEAKER_07]: for like lights and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had my Mac computer in there and I
just made music and smoked weed and did
[SPEAKER_07]: mushrooms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a good life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all right, but it was somehow I
still got women there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how, but it was shitty,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one day a good friend of mine,
Spencer from Garden Weeden, a big shout
[SPEAKER_07]: out to all of them, Maddie, Mike,
everybody really.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he just called or like we were talking
on Facebook at first and then he called me
[SPEAKER_07]: and he was like, are you really sleeping
outside?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yeah, I mean, it's not
really outside, but yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, well, would you rather just
come here and grow weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really an impulse decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everybody thought I was bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, in two weeks I'm out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm going to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I heard it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie was like, you're going to meet our
friend Sloppy in like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to take the room downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did take that room and I slept right
next to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Up in forever and just like chilled out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, no, I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just told everybody I was leaving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody believed me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two weeks came and I was gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't miss it at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been amazing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just there's so many people with the same
mind state and positive energies and just
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to help each other and progress in
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that's big.
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't like progressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean- Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are stuck and want to be okay
with where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In content, that's such a plague.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got this group of people here
at this table, because we're all people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are all about moving each other and
ourselves forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't ever be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you get comfortable,
that's when you start fucking up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stagnation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be ahead, you got to keep
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If life is super duper easy and you do the
same thing every day and not much changes
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're unhappy about it, there's only
one thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make the progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the next steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're already stuck and
frustrated, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make yourself more stuck and frustrated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to think it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, yeah, grab your nutsack and
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our good friend, Joey Diaz would say,
girl, some fucking balls got sucked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Slop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were moving in a trailer and big
shout out to Garden of Weedon because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what, if Spence and Manny would not
have encouraged you to move out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never have met you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much love, much respect to that whole
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're some of my favorite people right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't know Joe either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Weedon is a beautiful bunch.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have only showed me extreme love in
all situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people that they've introduced to
me have been totally cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you came out here and now you live with
Spence for a little while and you started
[SPEAKER_01]: learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, I can remember so vividly the
first time that Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I can remember the first time I took
official dab, I got off the plane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they got a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when she pulled the rig and the torch
out, Manny pulled the rig and the torch
[SPEAKER_07]: out, I looked at her and I was like,
I don't really know what that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was like, no, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, weed is green.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I took a dab and I literally just
laid my face on the window and just
[SPEAKER_07]: stared.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're saying you might have been in
the car when you got your first dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you were off the plane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Within three seconds of being in the car,
she was like... Shout out to Manny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manny loves us and Manny dabs everybody
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go sit down at the house,
Manny's got, you want a dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like as soon as I walk in... Dab is an
under-ess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's globs.
[SPEAKER_07]: She globs you out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a half gram, I'm looking at the
house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe's nodding his head like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't add anything to that that is 100%
accurate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can... Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can totally remember the first time that
they were like, the lights cut on and they
[SPEAKER_07]: were like, brought me into the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was... I would like to say it was all
white widow and two blue dream plants in
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all you could smell was the blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember those days.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the feeling in my body of
overwhelming sensations that I honestly
[SPEAKER_07]: thought that I would never experience
something like that without going to
[SPEAKER_07]: another country.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: But back in North Carolina, if you have
that many plants, you are... They think
[SPEAKER_07]: you're a fucking terrorist.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, come SWAT force ready,
tazing and shooting.
[SPEAKER_07]: This plant is going to spread like Jumanji
and kill the town.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst thing about a raid man is the
first thing they do is shoot your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so fucking shitty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this sounds crazy, but if they
shoot my dog in front of me, it's going
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm going to strike an officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say that, but for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothetically, you just might.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For real, because that's a loved family
member.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Harvey and Bane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and they're monsters now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need their own Instagram,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need their own Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slow motion, neuro-grads and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: These dogs are bad ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need their own Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Pitbulls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, and I hate the judgment on Pitbulls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how you can't bring them to Denver
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the sweetest dogs I know is a
Pitbull and she will climb up into your
[SPEAKER_01]: lap and let you pet her like a kitty.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's precious and she's a Pitbull.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then her boyfriend slash brother,
because I'm not sure what the relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a little bit of both from her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that dude is also one... He's a dumb
ass, but he's one of the sweetest dogs
[SPEAKER_01]: ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's made of bricks, but he's still one of
the coolest dogs ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dogs are the same as children.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can raise them to be good or you can
raise dumb asses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some dogs got some shit in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some dogs do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do some children.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some dogs are just born with a little
demon inside just like some kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to slap this shit out of them once
in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yo, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, just bash me with questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bash you with you want questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with whatever, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hearing about how you moved here and
then you started growing weed and you saw
[SPEAKER_01]: some White Widow and some Blue Dream and
it blew your fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get to trim that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my first trim, I remember everybody
was like, not wanting to trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: Acting like it was about to be this hard,
test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trimming is the worst.
[SPEAKER_07]: My first time I was like, this is fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the greatest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I've trimmed like a hundred or so
more plants and I'm like, fuck trimming.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can totally remember the first time
doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love if I have company from out of
town coming, trying to get them into a
[SPEAKER_07]: harvest and just get them involved in any
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like I said, a lot of people in
any legal states in general, just think
[SPEAKER_07]: that like this is impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something we can totally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can legalize cannabis nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all be growing a little bit of
ganja in our house and not have to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: store, not have to, excuse me,
not have to go to the street corner,
[SPEAKER_01]: not have to fucking waste money on
cannabis and not have to worry or wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all talking about earlier how we
all love that we grow the weed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you bring your herb and I'm not
afraid to smoke Joe's herb and Sloppy
[SPEAKER_01]: brings his herb and I'll totally smoke
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pull out mine and they will totally
smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anybody else came up, there'd be a
few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you put in this shit?
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't always like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to smoke some straight brick weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I started out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the nineties, I was smoking that sexy
maxi brick for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: 500 a pound and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to trim that shit with Spence and
Matty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taught you how to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what pretty much springboarded you
into growing?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really, it was really just I needed
something to have that I could be proud of
[SPEAKER_07]: and look forward to and involve myself in
and keep my mind functioning and have
[SPEAKER_07]: goals and objectives with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, as somebody that smokes,
growing has always been a dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I wish I could try to do this and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as soon as a dream is presented,
you have to take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't take it, you're a lame
straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is his anti-crime.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember, yo, it is, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis helps me in so many ways without
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I would have and failure
without cannabis and failure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I would be the person that I
am today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been your biggest failure at
growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, um, mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking mites, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like not thoroughly checking clones from
people and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then not being on top of sprays and
then just mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: Being a persistent little fucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you won't do that again, will you?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful in there right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I can remember my first harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: My first harvest honestly blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I had no- I'll co-sign that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very, you know, very good first
grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the first time I've ever grown
anything and I, Black Cherry Camp,
[SPEAKER_07]: shout out to Irie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, that shit was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark purple and sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeti.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Yeti was so dense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Jesse for his find on that
Yeti.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I had train wreck that just smelled so
potent and then Sour Patch Kush,
[SPEAKER_07]: which was, I mean, it's just good smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the Salt Pepper Ketchup?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the SPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salt Pepper Ketchup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was with them once and, uh, we were
doing clones and it said SPK on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yo, is this Salt Pepper
Ketchup?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the strain's been known as now
in this group.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yo, it's just, it's so beautiful here.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you smoke and you want to be somewhere
where you're accepted and you have events
[SPEAKER_07]: that you can go to and like, you don't
have to go out of the country anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: You, you could come here or really you
could just start doing stuff to make it
[SPEAKER_07]: legal where you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I keep telling people to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't have to move, uh,
stand up for your state.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I mean, it's not going to happen
everywhere, but, uh, it could.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's already an activist group in your
state making strides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Find them.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever state you are in, find them,
find the normal, just start in the basic,
[SPEAKER_08]: easiest place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike gave us a nice lesson a few episodes
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's titled, uh, getting involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to learn how to get
involved with some sort of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: movement, definitely check out that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also just contact your local
normal, NORML, the national organization
[SPEAKER_01]: for the reform of marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contact them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you how to get started in,
uh, teaming up with locals in your area,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to change the rules and do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So slop is here now though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's gotten away from his, uh,
nefarious life, his nefarious activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's put some people behind him,
changed himself up and now, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you doing well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got yourself a normal day job and
you're doing shit, taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what else do you do when you're not at
work and when you're not in the garden?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I make music.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the main things I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I really like rapping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I paint.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love painting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just take up painting or is that
something?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's I'm fairly new at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I'm not great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You sold one already.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sold a, uh, fear in Las Vegas painting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big ups to who bought that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Dan dangles for 20,
I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big ups to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but I just like, if I could give
anybody advice, it'd be a do stuff that
[SPEAKER_07]: you enjoy doing and do it as much as you
can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I'm in the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to go in the garden as much as I can
making music.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I have a regular garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like my broccoli's are looking amazing
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A garden in the front of your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was checking it out on the way out the
door the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks really nice, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come through and pick some stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, somebody said that the other day
they're like, yo, what if you catch people
[SPEAKER_07]: in the, in the front of your house,
just picking stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, if they need it that bad,
they can have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like steal my zucchini.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just came to my cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good salad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, yeah, just do what you want to do
and do the most of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And be nice to other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there's a lot of conceited people in
this world that just don't even notice
[SPEAKER_07]: other individuals in their life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how do you go somewhere public and
not acknowledge that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: around other people?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Slop's way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Came to drop some random knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call people out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, like the other day, this lady,
shout out to the lady, uh, just pushed her
[SPEAKER_07]: cart right in the entrance door of Walmart
and just left it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yo, you could push it two
feet that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she tried to keep walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yo, you lazy bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got mad as hell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she turned around and look at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, and you try to say the youth
is bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like put your card up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just blocked everybody from walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you had like, you're the only
person at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slop is calling bitches out like a champ.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's why I like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can go home and smoke and forget about
that fucking lazy bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that sounds like something I would
have ranted about on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, shout out to Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew all I had to say was Periscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, everybody jump on Periscope and make
it a daily thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, oh, I'm sloppy 919 on Periscope and
all, uh, all social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same, but yo, the other day I was
chilling with some kids in Tokyo and they
[SPEAKER_07]: were skateboarding and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really cool to see like,
uh, real perspectives of other places and,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, and the way that they interact and
just all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I really enjoy Periscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's, it's, it's enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best social networking app out at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like watching or broadcasting more?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I would say watching just because,
uh, I like other countries.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like seeing what's up in China.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: China is one of the best feeds to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That and Japan, Russia, some, there's some
kids in Russia doing crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're so mean to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they see that you're an American,
they'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be talking in a Russian accent in
Russian, and they'll see something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're American like, oh America,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just go right back to the
Russian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh shit, I'm getting out
of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brazil is super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck Dubai as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even trying to be a dick about
it, but the United Arab Emirates does not
[SPEAKER_01]: like white people when we go on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, I mean, there's been wars going on for
like thousands of years, but I ain't got
[SPEAKER_07]: no part of that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to scope it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to see what the fuck is up
over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're broadcasting, let me watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to see some sheiks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sheiks and some sheiks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone in the room is slightly
addicted to Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a slight addiction here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I found out about it,
I go to sleep to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do it at least once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I jump on and do a quick, like sometimes,
you never know with me, it could turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got people watching and they're
talking to me, it could be an hour and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get podcast information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people ask me questions and I'm like,
oh yeah, I'm going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that on the next show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I get stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've actually done a live show
with everything on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully I'll do that in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't announce it because I wanted to
do like a practice run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, let's just get in here and see
without telling everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next time I'm all like pre-planet,
it'll be like some night at 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, this night I'm going to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say a day because I don't want
anyone to think there's a real day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're going to join Periscope and
just be a fucking creeper, just watch
[SPEAKER_07]: porn, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you're fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I block a lot of people on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that troll ban hammer going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down with the trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, we've been going like
25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy, what's next for you, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here, you're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your feet on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some shit set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem to be doing pretty good for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it yourself, quit moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you quit moving, you'll get
stagnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really going to start trying to really
step my garden up and try to grow some
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to bring weed to my friends that
they can look at and be like, damn,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also trying to move my family out
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a big family man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mama will be here Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nephew is cute as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see those Facebook and Insta pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up little guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to be a ladies man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get the fam out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, honestly, if you really want
to know what's next for me, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: get out of the country within the next
like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be exploring places.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to check out other places,
but I would never go somewhere that
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis is frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucked all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go visit those places at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Dubai and go walk through
those places where those guys on Periscope
[SPEAKER_07]: hate us and go Periscope there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Periscope there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, we get ran over by a camel in two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They drive tanks and Humvees and shit down
the street and Maybox and McLaren's.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, for real, if I had to say like,
definitely what's next is just
[SPEAKER_07]: self-improvement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to grow as a person.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So improve as the self, get the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once the family's here,
you're going to take off and go travel to
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I say that, I've been saying that
forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may never happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have to be the same as moving to
Colorado and impulse doing now thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just like to experience other
cultures more than just Periscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go feel the vibe, taste the food,
smell the air, put your feet in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake hands, get their diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a way to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work on that immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to travel all over the place too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually cannabis will take me all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up worldwide podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'll throw a book bag on and do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can worldwide podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I need is one book bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do a whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need the Zoom H6 and a book bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got this going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get furniture to make us like a little
portable battery book bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Solar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solar panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a book bag email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Book bag email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wave of the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want one for the car, but I foresee a
lot of arm burns.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, and the thing with the car is you
could have the quick D attachment so it
[SPEAKER_07]: just looks like a breathalyzer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the car pulls you over, he's like,
oh, this guy hasn't been drinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I've chilled out in the car on
the dabs in the car, the Periscope in the
[SPEAKER_01]: car, the fucking speeding in the car
because I got pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got off like fucking
scot-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a six foot five dreadlock Rasta man.
[SPEAKER_01]: My car smelled like skunky, cushy,
danky madness and that cop had no problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with it and he let me go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to take one for the team
and chill out in the car a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beauty of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where else does that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: He smelled my breath and when he realized
there was no alcohol in my breath,
[SPEAKER_01]: he let me go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had actually eaten a chocolate covered
jalapeno just moments before he pulled me
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when he smelled my breath, he made this
wrinkled up face like, oh God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He knew I wasn't drinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's all about how you handle
those situations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, even if you don't like them,
which you really have no reason not to,
[SPEAKER_07]: they got to do their job too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But just be their best fucking friend for
10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how hard is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, sir, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, them teeth are white as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I'm just saying like,
I say as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything ends in yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much like, yeah,
I had the license registration,
[SPEAKER_01]: proof of insurance in my hand by the time
he got up to the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, you just got to do that kind
of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, dude, guys, if you guys,
if you got to deal with cops, just know
[SPEAKER_01]: your rights, but keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's don't try to be assertive to the
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to get shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your hands where they're visible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, they got a gun and they're
afraid of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they know who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, we've been going close to a half
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got anything funny you want to
ramble about here at the end of the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been kind of rambling anyway,
but anything you want to wrap up with Slop
[SPEAKER_01]: since it's kind of the sloppy 9-1-9 show
this time?
[SPEAKER_07]: Slop tart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slop up a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slop a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, once I Twittered, like, how many
ways can you stay sloppy?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I literally got like 70 something
responses of like the slopinator and shit
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the craziest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, I just really appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, this is awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: A great honor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know what's up, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the room with Irie and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to more if it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude, we'll do this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, how about yourself, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything to any words of wisdom for the
end of a podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, nothing too much else.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to know that Joe can throw down a
hell of a beatbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to make this happen
because it wouldn't be right if I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: try.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to read a commercial or like some
closing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to try to get Joe to do
a little bit of beatboxing and then maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get Slopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never gave Slop credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys remember that In the Garden of
Weed and Getting Weeded song?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my homie Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We played that on the podcast a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming and thanks for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I start reading this and before I
ask you guys to beatbox, huge thanks to
[SPEAKER_01]: both you guys coming and taking an hour
out of your day and being on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are welcome back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people will have questions for both of
you, so we'll get answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start your own garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's finally thought of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the theme of Joe's rap
and Slop's going to freestyle over it here
[SPEAKER_01]: in a minute if I can get that shit to
happen whenever you guys are ready.

[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the website, go to the podcast tab,
hit the donation button.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like the show is worth a
couple of bucks, if you feel like my time,
[SPEAKER_01]: my energy was worth a few bucks,
throw in a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seriously trying to work up to a Zoom
H6 so that we could take the podcast to a
[SPEAKER_01]: few more places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to get that here before the
next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, if you want to make a
contribution, just go to the website,
[SPEAKER_01]: throw a few bucks at the PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not begging for a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got $5, if you got $10,
that would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to add some zeros onto the end
of that, I am not going to complain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm begging now, so I'm going
to move on with this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to my guests once again for coming
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my Ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, until next time, take a fat dab
and give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn this music down a little
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Fred
Garvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted something to Facebook and Fred
politely commented saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, you've been doing a great job,
but you've kind of strayed away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked for more grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fred, I can't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have strayed away from the grow lessons
that I've tried to provide you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been so much great news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that all of the news has been
great, but there's been so much important
[SPEAKER_01]: news that I felt like it's been my job to
bring that news to the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have gotten a little bit away from the
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot into the news, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get back into grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of this will be a little bit about
grow lessons, and then the next episode is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be about pH, which is all about
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fred, you're totally correct, and I will
fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get back to the grow lessons,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get that far, I know I just said
we're going to get back into grow lessons
[SPEAKER_01]: and get away from the news, but I've
already had this episode planned,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you're going to have to bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, there's a very important news
article that I want to read to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thumbing through my computer here
trying to find it now to tell you the
[SPEAKER_01]: truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get right to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This news article comes from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this very important since I have
recently taken over as the lead grower at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I am running a large facility,
things like this really stand out to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: so let's get right to the article,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from The Cannabis, and it was
written by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated
[SPEAKER_01]: Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline is,
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously this is going to be about
pesticides and bugs and cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have ever grown any cannabis,
you'll know that the number one obstacle
[SPEAKER_01]: can be bugs for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once bugs show up, it is hard as hell to
get rid of bugs in a grow room if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not experienced and if you don't know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, As legal marijuana moves from
basements and backwoods to warehouses and
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial fields, the mold and spider
mites that once ruined only a few plants
[SPEAKER_01]: at a time can now quickly create a
multimillion-dollar crisis for growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: some returning to industrial strength
chemicals, raising concerns about safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say multimillion-dollar crisis for
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not kidding, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The facility that I am working in,
that I am helping them finish build,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have four flowering rooms, and one of
those rooms has 26 Gavita lights hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our projections are, almost anybody's goal
if you're growing with a Gavita,
[SPEAKER_01]: your goal is two pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 52 projected pounds of cannabis
coming out of that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really tell you what the going
rate is for a pound of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado right now at a retail center or
being sold from retail to retail center,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that is quite an investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to fuck up 52 pounds of weed,
that would really cost us quite a bit of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not make the money we planned on
making.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bummer in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can't pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're short money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you don't have product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you can see how one 52-pound
harvest could really cause a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got all the wasted time
and the wasted plants because the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: cost money, all the wasted nutrients,
all the wasted electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could really add up quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to continue the article here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: It says,
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an industry that's been illegal
for so many years that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing, said Frank Conrad,
lab director of Colorado Green Lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: a pot testing lab in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: In states that regulate marijuana,
officials are just starting to draft rules
[SPEAKER_01]: governing safe levels of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, there have been no reports on any
human illness traced to chemicals used on
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, but worries do persist.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Denver this spring quarantined
tens of thousands of marijuana plants at
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 growing facilities after health
inspectors suspected use of unauthorized
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the plants were later released
after tests revealed the pot was safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But two producers voluntarily destroyed
their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there was about 600 pounds of
cannabis voluntarily destroyed because of
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article says, The article goes on to
say, In Oregon, a June investigation by
[SPEAKER_01]: the Oregonian newspaper found pesticides
in excess of legal limits on products
[SPEAKER_01]: ranging from marijuana buds to
concentrated marijuana oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other pesticides detected on the marijuana
are not regulated by Oregon's marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: rules, meaning that products containing
those chemicals still can be sold there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental Protection Agency,
which decides which pesticides can be used
[SPEAKER_01]: on which crops, just said last month that
Colorado and Washington authorities that
[SPEAKER_01]: they could apply to have some cannabis
related chemicals approved through what's
[SPEAKER_01]: called a special local need registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that process could take years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like we're on our way,
but it could take years, it says here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, There aren't any labs
here that'll test for it yet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, up until this industry got
hugely popular on a recreational and legal
[SPEAKER_01]: level, the guidelines and the people who
were responsible for quality control were
[SPEAKER_01]: the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the ones responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something that we were proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not let out a product that had
been sprayed with some bullshit or a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that had powdery mildew on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the ones who were responsible for
that and took that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that it's so commercially popular
and everybody's buying and growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling cannabis, the art and the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I hope you guys heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some amazing thunder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's finally raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it's so popular, everyone's
worried about the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gotten away from the art and the
pride, and they're just doing whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do to get plants on the ground,
pounds out the door and money in the cash
[SPEAKER_01]: register and customers out the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since people have lost the heart,
they're not growing from their heart like
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to teach them to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to come up with some sort of
testing and we have to create rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says, it's a lot more difficult than
it sounds and it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington Liquor Control Board spokesman,
Brian Smith said about testing for
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, unscrupulous pot growers can
use banned chemicals with little chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: being caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were taken by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole pesticide issue, said Ashley
Kilroy, Denver's director of marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was talking to a room of about 200 pot
industry workers who had invited...
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't... It's missing a word
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invited lunch after the... Invited to a
lunch maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hear this month to learn about
pesticide quarantines and rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, they skipped a word in this article
and it totally threw me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says invited lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the growers heard wasn't encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no federal agency that will
recognize this as a legitimate crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: said Whitney Crenshaw, a Colorado State
University entomologist and pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys don't want to go start
reading about how to battle bugs or
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew on a large scale on the
internet because there's so much bullshit
[SPEAKER_01]: that you'll have to feed through that if
you don't have a good base knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll just confuse you and mess you up
even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So marijuana growers are indeed guessing
when they treat their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, one of the chemicals cited in
Denver quarantines, a fungicide called
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle 20, is commonly used on grapes and
hops, but can become dangerous when heated
[SPEAKER_01]: and is banned for use on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: No research exists on whether the
fungicide is safe for use on pot that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, something I've read recently about
exactly Eagle 20 is Eagle 20 gets inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of...
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it goes in the plant is what it does
and it stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops the plant from producing powdery
mildew and it can last for 60 to 90 days
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little crazy if you understand
the plant biology there, but also what
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read is if it gets on your skin,
it absorbs into your skin and it changes
[SPEAKER_01]: your RNA and you won't notice it because
you might not live long enough to even
[SPEAKER_01]: notice the changes that occurred in your
body, but your grandchildren will be
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grandchildren will have birth
defects, attention deficit disorders,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't guarantee they will, but that is
what this type of chemical does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't fuck you up, but it messes you
up in the insides to where your kids' kids
[SPEAKER_01]: are messed up, which is... That's got to
be some serious dangerous shit that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to mess with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want sprayed on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want sprayed on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several pot growers interviewed by the
Associated Press agreed that research is
[SPEAKER_01]: needed on pesticides for pot, but they
pointed out that pesticides are widely
[SPEAKER_01]: used on food crops and that weed consumers
have never before had as much information
[SPEAKER_01]: about the marijuana they buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairworth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, who is cultivation manager of
Denver's Herbal Remedies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for butchering your name
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairworth does not use any banned
chemicals on his plants and was not
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by the quarantines, but he
questioned some of the banned chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have all these chemicals that are
safe on products you eat, but you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: use them on marijuana, I don't know that I
agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The founder of the nation's oldest
marijuana legalization advocacy group,
[SPEAKER_01]: Keith Straub of the normal organization,
National Organization for the Reform of
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Laws, pointed out that
regulators today are at least starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at marijuana safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 1980s, the federal government used
an herbicide called Paraquat to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit marijuana crops, even though the
poison had been banned from national
[SPEAKER_01]: forests because of environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of sick that they poisoned
this weed, the weed made it to the street,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when they said, hey, this weed's out
there, they went, not our problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal, don't fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough love from the government right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to smoke a product that has
mold or pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you even want to put that into your
body?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you want to put that in your pipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you, as a grower, why would you
want to put that out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you act like you're proud?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you even sell that to somebody?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just weirdness to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that article came from, I'm scrolling
back up to remember her name, it is
[SPEAKER_01]: Kristen Wyatt from the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I got to clear my throat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a grower, I find it kind of wrong
that people would even spray some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit on their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use anything that is not
completely organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I avoid using sprays,
but since I work at a grow and I go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of grows, I know that I'm putting
myself at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need some sort of safety net.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do use products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to use too much neem oil because
neem oil will definitely affect the flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: of my extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are certain things that I'll use,
certain things that I won't use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've definitely been talking about
what we will and won't use at the shop
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are things that we
definitely do not want to put in our crop
[SPEAKER_01]: at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you guys are going to grow
weed or cannabis or pot or whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to call it, think about who's going
to consume the products that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to make people feel better and
not give them cancer or lung disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't spray some shit on your plants
that's going to give somebody cancer or
[SPEAKER_01]: lung disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't spray anything on your plants that
you wouldn't spray on your produce and
[SPEAKER_01]: then eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that should be our new guideline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you guys think about what would
happen if we gave some contaminated
[SPEAKER_01]: products to a person with a compromised
immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorite patients,
I'm a medical marijuana caregiver,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means I am responsible for growing a
few people's medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a patient, his name is Doug,
and Doug's an older dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's over 50 years old and he's not in
good health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I've known him, he's had three or
four major health problems in just the few
[SPEAKER_01]: years that I've known him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow medical cannabis for Doug to make
Doug feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow medical cannabis for Doug to help
Doug live longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to improve Doug's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm mixing up nutrients and reading
the back of a nutrient bottle,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of thinking about Doug's lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about Doug's heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about Doug's kidneys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about Doug's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about Doug because I don't
want to kill Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make Doug feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I see powdery mildew in a crop,
I cut the crop down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clean the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start over and figure out why I got
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have to spray some shit on there,
I think about Doug before I apply
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be good to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be good to Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be good to anybody else that's
going to smoke this stuff or eat this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff or make hash out of this stuff
because it's going into a sick person's
[SPEAKER_01]: body and we don't want to kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make them feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people, I wrote this down,
a lot of people are going to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse that they didn't know they were
using some dangerous pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, as a grower,
that is your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to read every bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to the store, you should have
already read about that product before you
[SPEAKER_01]: bought it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read every bottle and then go,
if you don't know what that one ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: is, if you don't know what spinosad is,
you heard me recommend spinosad to get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of white flies on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know what spinosad is before
you spray it, go read what that shit is
[SPEAKER_01]: and understand what you're spraying on
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your responsibility as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have read every bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have researched everything so
that you know what you're putting into
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and so that you know what you are
giving to sick people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this counts even if it's a commercial
or a recreational grow, because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know where that product is going to end
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea who's going to be smoking
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to make more people more
sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work on healing people, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be more responsible with your grows,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kristen Wyatt from the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, much respect to The Cannabis for
always keeping the good news coming my
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it is 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some killer thunder rolling
through my neighborhood right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has finally cooled off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been stupid hot here the past few
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting myself together a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are getting a dab
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the count of five, let's do a dab here
together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about the silence while I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys are dabbing with me so it
wasn't super silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got an email recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this was a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a message from somebody who follows
me on Facebook and also supports my
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope because I saw you on Periscope
and you reminded me about this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're not on the Periscope
app, if you're not checking out Periscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it on Apple devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it on Android devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Periscope app is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You download it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go follow me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I come on live, it'll whistle at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can open up the screen and you can
watch me rant or rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ramble or take dabs or walk
through a grow room or whatever I happen
[SPEAKER_01]: to be doing that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Periscope is a live broadcast and
then the video stays up for 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: unless I said something stupid and then I
go delete the whole video.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time I leave it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys check it out on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coughing from that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink and then I'm
going to get onto the point to this next
[SPEAKER_01]: topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Root Beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next topic is carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying, my friend sent me an
email asking about carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me start off by saying that the
information that you sent me, you had an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of which carbon filter you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have chosen the right filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the info that you gave me,
you were talking about getting the 39 inch
[SPEAKER_01]: tall with either an eight or a six inch
duct on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that thunder is so sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to turn off the compression so that
you guys can hear the thunder in the
[SPEAKER_01]: background, but I can't get it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not loud enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about selecting
a carbon filter, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I should explain to you what
a carbon filter is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're new, maybe you're not
familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: A carbon filter is what we use to take the
smell out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the air is leaving your grow room,
it's going to stink like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have flowering plants and you have
a blower, or an inline fan blowing air out
[SPEAKER_01]: of your grow room, because you have to get
that humidity out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get that old air out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get some fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're blowing that old air out,
it is going to smell like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to stink like a skunk or fruit
or berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to stink if you're doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the carbon filter goes on your inline
fan and then it goes out of your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows the air out of the facility and
all the air that passes through the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: filter will be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon filter is a cylinder with
activated charcoal in it and it connects
[SPEAKER_01]: to your inline fan and then it blows air
through the carbon filter first and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do inline fan or ducting,
however you choose, but then you go out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow area and the air that goes
through the carbon filter has all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants removed and those
contaminants include the odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically the stone version of
what a carbon filter is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cylinder with activated carbon or
charcoal that connects to your inline fan
[SPEAKER_01]: and as the air goes through it,
it removes the contaminated air and odors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we'll talk a little bit about how
to select your carbon filter because this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the part that our friend needed help
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal of your carbon filter and your
blower in your room is to exchange the air
[SPEAKER_01]: in your grow room every one to three
minutes for best odor control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what that means is you want to
take all of the air out of your room and
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to empty it and then refill
it, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be sucking air out of the room
and refilling every one to three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get the air completely
exchanged every two to three minutes or 20
[SPEAKER_01]: to 30 times an hour-ish for best odor
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do that, you need to find the cubic
volume of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do that, you measure length times width
times height and that will equal the cubic
[SPEAKER_01]: volume of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you know the cubic volume of your
room, then you need to get an inline fan
[SPEAKER_01]: that will pull that volume of air 20 to 30
times per hour through your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll find a carbon filter that
matches that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's easy because the... All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need to do, you'll find the cubic
volume of the room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make up a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This room is 12 by 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got a 12 by 12 footprint with an
eight foot ceiling, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes out to 1,152 cubic feet,
or that's the cubic volume of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want a blower, ideally,
that would pull, that would have a CFM
[SPEAKER_01]: rating of 1,152 or close to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go look at the Vortex fan,
they actually sell one that is an 1140
[SPEAKER_01]: CFM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would use that on either a six or an
eight inch duct is what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would want to find a carbon
filter that is rated for the same amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of CFMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to need a carbon filter
that is able to scrub about 1,152 not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to remove enough humidity and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend going 575 to like
1,152, maybe 1,200 at the max.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's how you need to select your
blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: A blower that is going to pull the
appropriate amount of air and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon filter will follow the blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you get the right size flange on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in anywhere from a four all the
way up to, I think a 16 is as big as I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have seen an 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I've ever seen that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that big of one in use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you find your carbon filter that
matches your blower, I would recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: that you hang the carbon filter as high as
you can in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang it up as high as you can because heat
rises.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep your air conditioner down
low and you want to keep your heat that's
[SPEAKER_01]: up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to suck that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys change out the carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember they don't last more than a year,
maybe two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are rechargeable,
but from what I have found, it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: much cheaper to just go buy a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard part is finding an economical or
not economical, an environmentally
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly way to get rid of your old carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have any suggestions on that,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to share that information on
the show, get somebody to dispose of their
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon filter more properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple lined up in my garage
that I don't know what to do with.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I hope that made
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my very quick lesson on how to
select a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang it high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're going to hang a big
carbon filter from the roof, from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceiling, I mean, make sure you do it
smartly, wisely.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, my grammar is terrible today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you use a stud and not like a
guy like myself or Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you find a beam in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do everything smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't destroy the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hurt yourself, especially hanging a
40 pound, 50 pound carbon filter above
[SPEAKER_01]: your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit could fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to break you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to break your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would miss you if you quit listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely hate it if you hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I'm talking about that,
here's a piece of advice that I don't talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about often enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was like, hey, bro, if you could
put like one or two essential pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: gear in a grow room that I may have
overlooked, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I told him?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said a fire extinguisher on the outside
of the room, right outside the door,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a smoke alarm inside of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't share that information enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I definitely recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a smoke alarm in there and then put
your fire extinguisher outside of the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a residential grow, because you
don't want to have to run in the grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: to find the fire extinguisher in the worst
case scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it right outside so you can kick
open the door and just start spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that never has to happen for you
guys, but I hope you do have a fire
[SPEAKER_01]: extinguisher in the case that you do need
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you had a smoke alarm to give
you some heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that guy that burned down your
girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I feel like I've been
going for about 30 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go click over to the garage man and
see how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about almost 27 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if I start doing the closing
now, we should wrap up right on time for a
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 minute episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to these 30 minute
episodes a whole lot more than you did
[SPEAKER_01]: those 45 and hour long shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of you pot smokers have
ADD or maybe you just have a short lunch
[SPEAKER_01]: break or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I appreciate you guys listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that you listened to the whole
episode and I can see who cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see who, but I can see that a lot
of the listeners cut out at certain times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've learned that about 36 minutes is
your attention span.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to keep them about 36 minutes,
40 at the most, but I appreciate everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm going to start closing up
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out our sponsors,

[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually about 715 because you know
what I did at 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a nice little 710 session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys all had a nice 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope wherever you are, whatever you're
doing, I hope you're loading up a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're twisting up a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're packing up the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're eating an edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're heating up the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're taking a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that in some way, shape or form,
you are consuming some type of high grade,
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality, super delicious dank
cannabis products with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to whoever is smoking,
toking, dabbing, eating some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a couple of things I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take a minute to give a huge
thank you to my friend, Sonny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonny sometimes listens to this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank Revay, a couple of
other people that you guys probably have
[SPEAKER_01]: never heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I especially want to thank Donovan
McNeely, Dan Lazzarini, Kenny Nicholson,
[SPEAKER_01]: Wayne D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a couple of weeks ago,
a good friend of mine by the name of Brian
[SPEAKER_01]: Ritchie, he passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He left this earth and he left us a little
saddened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian was a great musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian is probably, let's see, Brian was
probably close to 40 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 to 40 years older than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a musician just starting out and I
was playing in a club and Brian saw me
[SPEAKER_01]: play and he said, young man, you've got a
gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my band needs a drummer and I'd like
you to play with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this old guy approaches me
and asked me to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of thought, I don't want to play
with a bunch of old guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a young rock star.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something in my heart said, you should go
play with these old guys and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until I played with them, I was not a
drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a guy with a drum set that was
hitting drums with my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian and the band I joined with Brian
turned me into a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not a musician until that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian gave me musical career advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian gave me stage advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian taught me a lot about being a
professional musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian took me out of the bar mentality of
playing as a bar musician, just playing
[SPEAKER_01]: for free beer, trying to be a rock star.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put me in the mentality and mindset of
a working drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will never forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always grateful to Brian Ritchie
for the, what did he see in me?
[SPEAKER_01]: He had confidence in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had faith in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he put me behind the drums in his band
when I wasn't ready and let me earn my
[SPEAKER_01]: position there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked hard to be the drummer that
he needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been going on for a long time
about it, but Brian, I miss you,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for what you did to my musical
career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for what you did to my mindset as a
musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what I'm getting to is Saturday,
we threw a giant party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian didn't want a funeral because he
didn't want sadness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought that it was my duty to throw
a party for the man and get all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite mutual friends and musicians
together in one room and play one big jam
[SPEAKER_01]: and one last hurrah for our friend Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I organized an event in my friend
Sonny's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a large jam space with like a
large jam room.
[SPEAKER_01]: His house is like a club.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a small club attached to the back
of his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made a Facebook event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent out a few phone calls, a few
invites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got our old band together, came and
jammed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another band that Brian was in came and
jammed and a bunch of Brian's old friends
[SPEAKER_01]: came and played music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a potluck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to George Samaras.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought a lot of great goodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody who attended
the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody who played at
the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Danielle for helping me
organize the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: This party meant a lot to me and it was a
complete success and I am totally
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfied and grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to share all of it with you
guys and give a big thank you to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone can hear it all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to ramble about this party
too much, but I was super excited and I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like I wanted to thank everybody on
the podcast publicly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that I can put together
a party like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only had about four or five days to
organize and I got about 80 people in this
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really happy to honor Brian that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian, I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few weeks ago, well, it's been ongoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past few weeks, we have talked
about a raid that happened at a Santa Ana,
[SPEAKER_01]: California dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you guys a little update.
[SPEAKER_01]: These cops raided a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They treated all of the people in the
dispensary like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the dispensary was emptied of people,
they took down all the cameras and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they began to, they proceeded to destroy
this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They broke the TVs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They broke the security systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They caused damage to the safes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They caused a lot of damage to the
displays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these police officers had the
audacity to eat edibles on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There happened to be another hidden camera
in the building that was recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were recording that the cops didn't
know about, and they were caught talking
[SPEAKER_01]: mad shit they shouldn't have been saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were eating edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were playing darts and they were
acting like assholes on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have been caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensary's lawyer discovered the
video and filed a lawsuit against specific
[SPEAKER_01]: law enforcement officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here is where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an article that I found on reason
.com written by Jacob Solem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the headline says, Suspended cops say
video of them eating marijuana edibles
[SPEAKER_01]: during a raid violated their privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sub-headline is Santa Ana officers
want to stop their department from using
[SPEAKER_01]: the footage to investigate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and read you the
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Remember the Santa Ana,
California cops who were caught on video
[SPEAKER_01]: munching on what seems to be cannabis
infused chocolate bars after raiding an
[SPEAKER_01]: unlicensed medical marijuana dispensary in
May?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Orange County Register reports that
three officers who were suspended after
[SPEAKER_01]: the incident are trying to stop the Santa
Ana Police Department from using the
[SPEAKER_01]: footage in its internal investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among other things, their lawsuit argues
that the officers thought they had
[SPEAKER_01]: disabled all of the security cameras at
Sky High Holistic and therefore had a
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable expectation of privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cops complained that the dispensary
never got their permission to record them
[SPEAKER_01]: as they searched the premises.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these cops are trying to stop this
video from being used in court because
[SPEAKER_01]: they were illegally recorded because since
they had destroyed all of the security
[SPEAKER_01]: cameras, they therefore had a reasonable
expectation of privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that means that if I break into your
house and you film me, fuck your film
[SPEAKER_01]: because I had an expectation of privacy
while I broke into your house and stole
[SPEAKER_01]: all your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what these cops are saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets a two-way street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that a rule works just for
cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work for civilians,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These cops are trying to pull some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep reading here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, All police personnel present had
a reasonable expectation that their
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations were no longer being
recorded and the undercover officers,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling that they were safe to do so,
removed their masks, says the complaint,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was filed in Orange County
[SPEAKER_01]: Superior Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an interview with the register,
Sky High's lawyer, Matthew Pappas,
[SPEAKER_01]: noted that police routinely use
surveillance camera video against
[SPEAKER_01]: suspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty pathetic for police to say if
we don't like something that it can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: used as evidence, he said, they knew they
were on video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because they missed one camera
doesn't make it illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all agree here that this is
complete bullshit because if you or I were
[SPEAKER_01]: caught doing something on a film,
no matter how that film was made,
[SPEAKER_01]: that film would be used against us in a
court of law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That film would probably be edited by the
opposing lawyers to make us look like a
[SPEAKER_01]: pile of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that this videotape should
definitely be used in a court of law.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people, in my opinion, they
illegally fucking attacked, if you know
[SPEAKER_01]: more about the story, these people
illegally singled out this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that this video is used in
court.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, there are bigger problems in
America than we knew about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give a huge shout out to
Reason.com and also a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacob Solom.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, my friend Fred Garvin
recently sent me an email or was a
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook message and it said, I don't
remember exactly what it said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kind of misquote him
ridiculously, but he said, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, you used to do a bunch of grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what the show was about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recently you were not doing grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fred, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've responded to you on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I addressed this on the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with you, Fred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get back to the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a fat dab and then I
will be right back and we will talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the importance of pH in your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hang on for just one second,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab, maybe get a
drink, and I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I am back after a
couple of dabs and I am feeling great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time to talk about pH a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to skim through these
without sounding like I'm reading too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, but I needed some notes to keep
myself on track because this has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers and a lot of important things that
we need to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Properly adjusting the pH of your nutrient
solution can solve a lot of problems and
[SPEAKER_01]: it can greatly improve the quality of your
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do a little bit of consulting and
I really see a lot of people overlooking
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH of their nutrient solution and how
important it is to adjust the pH of their
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient solution before they feed their
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have a lot of problems in their
gardens that look like nutrient deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: and I see them trying to correct nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of times a pH imbalance will
look like it'll camouflage itself as maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: a Cal Mag problem or maybe a phosphorus
overload, but a lot of times it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: simple pH problem that could have been
solved by adjusting the pH of your
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient solution before you fed it to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will talk about soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are going to talk about
different areas of pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to talk about is the pH
balance of your nutrient solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be soil or hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working in soil, the optimum pH
range for your soil garden is about 5.5 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were working in hydro, your optimum
range is going to be somewhere between 5.8
[SPEAKER_01]: and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you keep hearing me say that we need
to be within a certain pH range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be ideal to find a certain number
and stick with it is what most folks would
[SPEAKER_01]: think, but the reason we need a pH range
is because some nutrients that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding our plants, some of the elements
that our plants are trying to absorb are
[SPEAKER_01]: available at certain pH levels and some
are available at different pH levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to pick like in soil,
nitrogen is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pretty much suck up nitrogen at
any point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron is more available on the lower side
of the pH scale, the 3.5 range,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 3.5 to about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.5 is where you're going to pick up iron,
but if you get any higher on the pH range,
[SPEAKER_01]: you stop absorbing the iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we're going to look at calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium doesn't absorb very well in the
5.0 range, but it does start picking up at
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really absorb calcium,
but if you go out toward the 7.5 range,
[SPEAKER_01]: you stop picking up calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these nutrients have a window where the
pH is ideal for the plant to absorb each
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have found that in soil,
somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 is when all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these nutrients become available at the
same time, ideally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in hydro, like we said earlier,
it's 5.8 to 6.2 where these nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: become available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you that the graph on the
hydro side is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a much more narrow window of
nutrient availability due to pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a lot to absorb,
but once this clicks in, it'll definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: make sense to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try to explain it like this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's really hot outside, you don't
want hot cocoa, but when it's really cold
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it's really cold outside,
you don't want ice cream, but when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: warm outside, you want ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we got to do, we got to find that
perfect day where you can have hot cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: for breakfast and you can have ice cream
for lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to do for the
plants by finding the perfect pH range.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to find that optimum spot
where they're in the mood for all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients we're feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we should probably talk about what pH
actually is and stands for.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH means potential hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's written with a lowercase P and a
capital H.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what pH is, is the measure of acid to
alkalinity in our nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is measured on a scale of zero to 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero is the most acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven is neutral, which means there's an
equal concentration of hydrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroxyl ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 14 is pure alkali.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's done it's measured on what is
called a lagarithmic scale, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: that every one point increase or decrease
in pH reflects a tenfold change in acid or
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a solution that's pH five,
that solution is 10 times more acidic than
[SPEAKER_01]: a solution that is pHed at six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got something that's pHed at
four, it is going to be 1,000 times more
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic than a solution that's pHed at six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind when you guys are
using your pH pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that we'll talk about
here in just a little bit, using your pH
[SPEAKER_01]: pen and your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be really on the money when
you're adjusting your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you found that range that your plants
really like, you're going to want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to set it right about there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using soil somewhere within
that five, eight to six, five,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in hydro somewhere in that five,
six to six, three range, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get your pH set and then keep an
eye on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pay attention to where the
plants, each strain is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little different, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to where each strain likes
that fucking pH set and try to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: there every time and take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that point one on there
is a huge difference in your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't just say, I'm close enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get it close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about how to adjust the pH
and measure that here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also you guys keep in mind,
if you're running hydro, your pH is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to change possibly every day because
you're going to have nutrients absorbed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have water evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be so many things that
happen causing your pH to change that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to be on that in
hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: In soil, you're just going to mix up the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end, before you feed it to the
plants, you will test it and then you will
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it actually seems like I'm
getting to the part where I should start
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining how to pH test your water and
then how to correct the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into that a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I would, if you're mixing a hydro
kit, go ahead and mix it in your
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir, fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill up your res with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you normally do it to the
recommended amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a 25 gallon res, go ahead and
do 25 gallons if you're doing a hydro kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing soil and you do five
gallon buckets or you got a big res,
[SPEAKER_01]: fill that up however you normally would
with the amount you normally would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then mix in your nutrients just like you
normally would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give a shout out to my buddy,
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: He taught me something and I don't know
how valid this is, but it made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: John says if you're using potassium
silicates, pour that in your water very
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a good sound reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day we'll get John on the show and he
can explain why.
[SPEAKER_01]: John says pour your potassium silicate
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you're going to use Cal Mag,
do your Cal Mag next and then do all of
[SPEAKER_01]: your other nutrients after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: His reasoning made sense and I don't want
to try to butcher the reason that he told
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one day we'll get John on the show to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a listener and you have a good
example of why and you can explain it,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me an email and I would like to see
what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if somebody else is on the
same page as my buddy, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill your reservoir, mix your nutrients
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your potassium silicate first,
then do your Cal Mag, then do the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: your nutrients however you wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then now is the time when you need to use
a pH pen or some type of pH meter or a pH
[SPEAKER_01]: probe and you need to stick that into this
nutrient solution and you need to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: the display says, what the number reads on
the display.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't afford a pH pen or a pH
meter, you can use an aquarium test kit to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you what the pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them at the aquarium shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably pick it up at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used in an aquarium environment to
tell you what the pH of your aquarium
[SPEAKER_01]: water would be so that you don't kill your
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll do the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just testing for pH here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff isn't going to go into your
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll take some water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you'll dip this strip into the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember how to use the
reagent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, it's been that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put some water on it and then you drop
these chemicals on it and it shows you
[SPEAKER_01]: what color it is and you measure it up to
the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's like real blue, then you're
the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's real red, you're the wrong
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get kind of in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those test strips, they're kind of a
pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you can tell by my description.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I haven't used it in years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'll never use it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a good pH pen or a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pens are way easier to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not drop your pen in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be toast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your pen calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know how to calibrate it,
take it to your local grow shop and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will probably calibrate it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the third or fourth time,
they'll get tired of doing it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will teach you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go ask them how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll calibrate your pH pen for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always keep, no matter what type of pH pen
you're using, always keep the probe,
[SPEAKER_01]: the tip, that white part in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always keep that wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something to remember with a pH
pen, a pH tester, a pH probe, other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the reagent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using the expensive,
any kind of pen that you dip in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it dries, it dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the thing to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it dries, it dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your pH pen wet, keep it calibrated,
keep it clean, and keep it handy all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, myself, I use the Blue Lab 3-in-1
combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a pH meter, a PPM meter,
and a temperature gauge on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called a thermometer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 3-in-1 combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't afford that, get yourself
those yellow mill walkies work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the grocery store and you
look for a pH pen, you'll see the yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: Milwaukee pH meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing's a piece of shit, but it will
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll do what you need done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend a better one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can afford a more expensive,
higher quality pH meter, I would go for
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but that little yellow Milwaukee piece
of shit will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will die on you soon, so be prepared to
buy another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get the next upgraded one,
whatever it is, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I like Blue Lab products.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy John was telling me he likes
another brand for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stick with the Blue Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you stick the meter in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you fill up your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix your nutrients in the proper
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let it be... It's got to be at about
room temperature, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want your water too hot or too
cold because that will definitely affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe set it in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's coming out of the faucet too hot
or too cold, go set it in your grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: for a little while so that it's the same
temperature as your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then mix your nutrients into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put your pH meter in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully most municipal tap water comes
out, depending on where you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's between eight and nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will change seasonally,
you guys, or when your local water company
[SPEAKER_01]: cleans their pipes or does some flushing
or changes chemicals that they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: use, or it'll be seasonal for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention because in the summer and in
the winter, I can tell a huge difference
[SPEAKER_01]: in my water quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test your water once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pour water out of the faucet,
let it get to room temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: stick your pH probe in there and see what
it is occasionally, just for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should always be testing everything
that's going into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always curious about what's going into
my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mix your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the hell was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix your stuff up, stick your pH pen in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show you a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you're close.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're usually... Once you've mixed your
nutrients, you're hardly ever going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need pH up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to put pH up in there,
you probably are mixing your nutrients too
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably using some something you
shouldn't be using.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably did something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some instances where your pH
will drop really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay, but you're going to need to
bring it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen very frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to be... Once you
mix up your nutrients, you're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be about 7.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need to get that down
closer to the 6.5 range, if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running hydro, you want to get
that down closer to the 6.0 kind of area,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you're going to want to do that is
slowly, very slowly add your pH down,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't get this shit in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get it on your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're new at this and you're
intimidated, or if you're a clumsy fucker,
[SPEAKER_01]: put on some gloves and put on some
protective goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend who's in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say his name because I don't want
to embarrass you, but my friend Jason,
[SPEAKER_01]: he splashed some pH down into his eye,
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he got a small drop of pH in his
eye, and he said he went completely blind
[SPEAKER_01]: in that eye, and he said it was so
excruciating that he couldn't open the
[SPEAKER_01]: other eye, and he had to use Siri on his
iPhone to call 911 to come to his house
[SPEAKER_01]: and help him in his grow because he
couldn't fucking see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put yourself in that kind of
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a clumsy fuck, wear some
goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're a pro, it might be a good
idea to wear some safety goggles or
[SPEAKER_01]: something when you're mixing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH adjusters can really, really mess
with your eyes and your skin if they get
[SPEAKER_01]: on you and get in your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, pour a little bit of pH down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start with five to 10 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's five milliliters in a five gallon
bucket is probably enough to drop your pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down where you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake it up real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your pH meter back in there and see
what you're testing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get it right on the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to fuck up a couple
of batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to use pH up and down so
many times that you just don't even want
[SPEAKER_01]: to use it because all the shit that you've
just added to your solution, you got too
[SPEAKER_01]: much pH up and too much pH down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you're going to have to just pour that
out and start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you're going to learn,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how you are going to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, add your pH up, add your pH down,
whichever you need to do, and then test
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you've got it right where you
want it, go ahead and pour that water into
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a soil garden, if it's a hydro
garden, go ahead and start turning on the
[SPEAKER_01]: res and get it going or the pumps or
whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways to do
hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm learning hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that this lesson for pH
is pretty much wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've covered all of my bullet
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that your local water will
change and you should check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of shit that you should
worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your local water is going to change
frequently and there's nothing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to just be on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way that you can really control
your water is if you set up a reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: osmosis machine and you start cleaning
everything out of all of your water and
[SPEAKER_01]: starting fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that could be a whole other lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will try to find a water expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were listening and you're an expert
on water and water quality for a grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring you on the show and you can
teach us all about water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot about the plant, but there
are so many niche areas that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: perfected like our buddy Sean's got
organics figured out and I seem to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder in the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Spence is the hatch guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are just so many small branches of
this that we've got figured out that each
[SPEAKER_01]: person does their own little as mastered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try to get a water guy on
here for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about water quality and
what you should be looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could probably be just a segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was going to branch off and say,
dude, I have been learning hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to my buddy John that
works with me at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the hydro master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be learning so much hydro in a
crash course here in the next few months
[SPEAKER_01]: that you guys are going to learn hydro
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will learn a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start sharing the hydro talk with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're building the most killer grow
facility at the spot dispensary in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: West Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, there are over a hundred lights
in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four flowering rooms broken
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 24 to 26 lights per room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a really nice veg area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are running 50 foot long flood and
drain tables that we fill up about 150
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons worth of water for a rez.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mix 150 gallons worth of newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pump that into the table at one end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shoots all the way to the other end of
the table, goes into a drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pump, a really snazzy pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality they use at SeaWorld shoots
all of that water through 50 feet of
[SPEAKER_01]: tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's two inch or three inch PVC
all the way back to the other end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it dumps it back into the table
and just keeps recirculating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then under each plant, then we have,
I can't really tell you too much about how
[SPEAKER_01]: we do the plant sites because that's kind
of a proprietary thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got each plant is designated its own
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in a rockwool cube and underneath
each rockwool cube and plant site,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a ring shooting a lot of oxygen
up underneath these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, we're feeding from the bottom and
the rockwool is wicking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we may, we're not sure if we want
to do this yet, but there may be a drip
[SPEAKER_01]: line put in to top feed all of the plants
so that we can drip that nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_01]: into the rockwool cube from the top and
then just let the roots hang into that
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygenated water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys, I'm learning so damn much
about hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have built, we have built, I can't say I
built, I've been involved in building a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge hydro environment and I've learned so
much without even putting plants in there
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are almost ready for plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be pulling harvest out of there in
no time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like we are so ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can tell just by the tone of my
voice that I'm fucking excited about the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Dave and Robert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for giving me the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also big shout out to the guys I've
been working with, my grow crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: my construction crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to John, big shout out to
Joe and a super shout out to Jaime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love all you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for supporting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for seeing the vision and thanks
for being a good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big ridiculous shout out right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I got that one off my chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I want to thank you for
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like it's almost time to wrap up
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you've listened to this far,
I'm going to do this to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast was of course brought to you
by my good friends at Hygril and their
[SPEAKER_01]: growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hygril does have two locations to serve
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a Denver store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on 6271 Beach Street and then there's
my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th
Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Hygril for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor growing
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, when you're at Hygril and you're
checking out, tell them that you listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast and they
will give you commercial pricing on your
[SPEAKER_01]: entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll save you a bunch of bucks,
which is always a good thing because money
[SPEAKER_01]: is expensive these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more ads, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do any more ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end.

[SPEAKER_01]: go do the show at a few more places,
go visit the Grimy Gatsby since we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get you to come down to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a podcast with Damsel in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get the Zoom H6, we'll get a lot of
shit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's all I got for you
today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow me on Instagram.

[SPEAKER_11]: Leave your parents smoke alone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Talking about the green.
[SPEAKER_12]: Indoor, outdoor, sing green.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we are in California, the place we
plant the indica.
[SPEAKER_12]: Proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a medical need.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell him out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You call it marijuana.
[SPEAKER_12]: In Jamaica, we call it ganja.
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen to the ganja song like I smoke my
bong.
[SPEAKER_12]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hemp me, hemp me.
[SPEAKER_12]: My ganja bag is empty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hemp me, hemp me.
[SPEAKER_12]: My ganja bag should be plenty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a medical need.
[SPEAKER_12]: She needs the weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, she really needs the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: The founding fathers smoke the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: The founding fathers plant the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: The founding fathers plant the seed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: You and I are 220.
[SPEAKER_12]: Love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you love weed, I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen to the reggae song.
[SPEAKER_12]: Smoke my weed, pump in my bong.
[SPEAKER_12]: Medical weed, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love the mouse.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just smoke his tats.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I love my weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Weed song.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 89 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_01]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming to you on a scorching hot
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is stupid hot today, but we're going to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to drink a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to water up the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to talk a little bit
about some heat issues that some friends
[SPEAKER_01]: of mine have been having in their gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about ways to cure a little
bit of heat problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got some ranting to do,
but before we get that far, this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: is brought to you by my friends at Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we all know that money is
expensive these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to get on with the
show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to let you guys know that I'm
recording with a new device today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using the new Zoom H6 Handy Recorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Zoom H6 so that I'll be able to
take this podcast on the road a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a much smaller unit than what I've
been using.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing will fit in my back pocket and
I can carry it around and I can do shows
[SPEAKER_01]: from events such as the Secret Cup,
the Cannabis Cup, or wherever we may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys look forward to episodes with
special guests coming up because now I can
[SPEAKER_01]: take the show to them instead of trying to
get people to come to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in kind of a shitty part of
Colorado where nobody wants to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to get like Damsel and Hunt
and people like that to come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I go to them, they're happy to be
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spend a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Zoom H6.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will take this show on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm going to ask you to do me a
favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're listening to the show,
let me know what you think of the sound
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if this quality is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if I've changed anything that
you've noticed because if this isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable, I'll go back to using the main
studio setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to pull this out,
give it a try, see what it was like before
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to take it on the road and record
with other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, big shout out to the Zoom H6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think of it,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's get into the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you that I saw some ducting issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a consultation for a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even charge him for it the other
day, but he's been saying, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: my room is getting way too hot this
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good start of a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walked in there and the first thing I
see is messy-ass ducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's got a decent grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got enough air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: His plants look good, but his ducting was
a complete mess, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen a lot of messy ducting
lately on my visits and consultations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I want to tell you is keep in
mind that every single twist and bend in
[SPEAKER_01]: your ducting reduces your airflow and adds
to the workload of your blower,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever kind of inline fan you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every bend puts more strain and more
pressure on that inline fan and slows down
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of air you're moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally, ducting would be in a straight
line with zero curves or bends or twists
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that's not rational because,
of course, we're growing in houses and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, and you have to move the
air around in not a straight line
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But try to get it as straight as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll save you a lot of money on heating
costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll save you money because you don't
have to run the blower as hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll save you money because you're more
efficiently cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So straighten out... Ooh, I just noticed
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put the cell phone too close to
the H6, you get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: interference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you didn't hear that too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading notes off of my cell phone
here, which is why I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, try to keep your ducting in a
straight line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another great way to save some money on
cooling, you guys, would be to run your
[SPEAKER_01]: lights at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kilowatts from the electric company are
actually cheaper at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not running your electricity
at peak hours, it'll save you a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would recommend, if you can do
it, and this will only work for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people on your lifestyle, your schedule,
if you can have your plants come on,
[SPEAKER_01]: right around here, it gets dark about nine
o'clock, eight or nine o'clockish right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, it would be ideal to have your lights
come on at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way it's cool outside, the sun has
gone down, the lights kick on,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that way you're not fighting the sun
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not adding sun and grow lights to
that grow room to try to cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So turn on your lights at night if you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so you guys, straighten out
your ducting, run your light cycle at
[SPEAKER_01]: night, and you'll save a few bucks on
cooling costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting your plants too hot is gonna cause
them to become fluffy, and it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease your harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you've got electricity bills to
cover, every gram counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta do your best to pull every
gram you can out of the room since you've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotta pay for every kilowatt that you've
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So figure out how to get the ducting
straight, start running your lights at
[SPEAKER_01]: night, and that will help you out quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else you guys could keep in mind
during these hot summer months is
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the temperatures rise, the humidity
outside is rising also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be aware of how humid your rooms are.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first year that I have
personally needed to go buy a dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_01]: for my main flowering room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fans and air conditioning are not enough
sometimes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to remove the stagnant,
humid air from your rooms and replace it
[SPEAKER_01]: with fresh, CO2-rich air for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, make sure you're pulling that
air out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hot air needs to be sucked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, one more thing I can think of
to help you keep your rooms cool is to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to the filters in your air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air conditioners, guys, those filters are
designed to last for a year without being
[SPEAKER_01]: replaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind, you guys are running
them in a grow room where there may be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of extra dirt, a lot of humidity,
and there's a lot of extra work on that
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't expect that unit to be
competing with four or five or six,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you got, that many thousand watt
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't expect that thing to come on
when you buy it and never shut off like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of us do with an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got an air conditioner that
has filters, replace those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get clogged up, the air doesn't
flow through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get as much cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wasting electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That electricity is not turning into a
gram of weed, so you're flushing money
[SPEAKER_01]: down the toilet, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your air conditioner may require a little
extra maintenance since we're working it
[SPEAKER_01]: so hard, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also keep in mind where you're putting
your air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may suck up a little bit more dirt and
shit like that, just depending on where
[SPEAKER_01]: you have put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that was a good little rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're talking about replacing things
and things that you need to upgrade in
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow room, I figured I'd make a
little kind of a checklist of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a good idea to replace and check
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that you guys need to replace is
your bulbs in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HID bulbs don't last forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using good bulbs, you can switch
those out about once every six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you've got the budget, you can toss
them every two crops, which would be about
[SPEAKER_01]: every four months.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only if you're using them only as a
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're buying those cheap PlantMax
bulbs, you guys, or whatever generic brand
[SPEAKER_01]: you're buying at your grow shop,
I would recommend replacing those every
[SPEAKER_01]: single flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those aren't high quality bulbs,
and they burn out a little bit quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, if you're using those cheap
bulbs, guys, what I would recommend is
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest the room, empty the room,
clean it out, and replace those bulbs
[SPEAKER_01]: before you put new plants in there again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using good bulbs, you can go
probably two cycles, maybe three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely wouldn't go past four
flowering cycles with the same bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would replace that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bulb will stop putting out as much
light, but it will still be sucking up as
[SPEAKER_01]: much electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will still be making as much heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you're not turning those
kilowatts into grams of weed, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to pay for electricity that
is just causing heat, which is making your
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditioner run stronger, which is
pulling more electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the cycle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so don't forget that your bulbs
in your veg area are just as important as
[SPEAKER_01]: in your flowering room, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to swap those bulbs out
occasionally also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those new 315 bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reason those at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to put out quite a bit of light,
and they're affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys can afford the 315s,
I would definitely recommend those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go through your metal
halide bulbs, I would recommend those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, every two months, every four
months, every six months at the very
[SPEAKER_01]: longest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I wouldn't run longer than six
months on the same bulb, no matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got those T5 bulbs, you're going
to need to replace those quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things just crap out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've noticed about the T5s,
if you buy a fixture with like eight T5s
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, just pretty much plan on replacing
all eight T5 bulbs all at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're all just going to start
shitting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When one goes out, just go by the whole
set.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, we've talked about
replacing your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what about the ballasts?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using modern digital ballasts,
they'll last a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them come with a nice warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't hear this from me,
but anything that comes with a warranty
[SPEAKER_01]: that will be replaced because of the
warranty, I make sure to break that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: about a month or two before the warranty
is up, sometimes a few months before the
[SPEAKER_01]: warranty is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just break it, just fucking break it,
and then go get another one on the
[SPEAKER_01]: warranty, because these companies are
charging you enough for shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should last a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it and go get a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to refurbish the one that
you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to resell it as a
refurbished unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make plenty of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just break the fucking thing right before
the warranty is up and get yourself a new
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using those old magnetic
ballasts, those things will go forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't see any drop in light power from
a ballast from what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just die one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't even warn you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when your ballast warranty is about to
be up, go get another one, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that should be enough ranting
for now about fixing your rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I should remind you of that I
have mentioned in a previous episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: since we're talking about replacing
things, calibrate your pH meters,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your TDS pins, your pH pins, whatever else
you want to call it, your EC meter,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in England or Britain,
you guys calibrate those things quite
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently, because when that messes up,
you don't even notice, and you're just in
[SPEAKER_01]: there trying to adjust pH, and you're
doing it wrong, and you don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you're going to start causing problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
just over 10 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's do a dab on the air
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was recently gifted some blueberry
headband shatter from The Spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually, The Shatter is from our
boys at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it at The Spot out in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a quick drink of this
bubbly carbonated beverage I got here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we're going to put together a
dab, and we're going to take a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I needed a carbonated drink
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was much deserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get a dab together real
quick, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to something called the
Perfect Jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted a jar called the Perfect Jar
by my buddy Hunt of the Grimy Gatsby,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they might be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be the Perfect Jar,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a ... I don't even know what kind of
plastic this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real sturdy plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice screw on lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's airtight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nicely ... It's got dividers inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to carry my herb in one
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a dabber in one container,
and then like four or five different kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of shatter in the other little containers
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice container, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you kicking that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we are going to dab the ... What
did I call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blueberry headband from our friends
at TerpX, and I'm putting a dab of it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the dabber right now as we speak,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are dabbing out of the Eric Ross 4.0
Custom Prototype that's autographed by
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Ross on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got his little signature etched in
the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that, it's got the highly educated
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Highly Educated and Task
Rock, and that D-nail attachment is
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to what is called the G-nail coil
by our friends at Emotax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Giddy Up and Emotax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm burping from that drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the dab together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry Headband Shatter from TerpX,
available at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the time you hear this,
they'll have a totally different brand of
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter in or a totally different flavor,
but let's review this anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: No choke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me back up a step here.
[SPEAKER_01]: By looking at it, it's nice and glossy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice shine to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice clear amber-y yellow
color, so it looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the inhale... Well, let me talk about
the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just smells like hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's smell it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it up to the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just sm... Like shatter mostly
smells the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that shattery, like almost a
honey kind of a sweet smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I taste it, on the inhale,
I definitely tasted the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the exhale, it had a hint of cushy,
chemi type of stuff, an earthy flavor on
[SPEAKER_01]: the out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the end is blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a hint of blueberry on the
tongue still.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The feeling is straight headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like I just put a headband on my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like I just slowed down,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like I just slowed down a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get back into doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly approve of the blueberry
headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it's going to taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get to the point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions and answers with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first question is about a product
called OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a while ago, I mentioned that I use
a product called OGT, Veganic Secret Sauce
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me to talk a little bit
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that product a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any of the product with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used all of what I have and I kind of
haven't been using it since I ran out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I replaced it with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it is is an organic tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is able to be mixed almost instantly
and then fed to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of teas that we're using need to be
mixed up and they need to brew for 24 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff, you can pour the powder into
some water, give it a nice stir and feed
[SPEAKER_01]: it directly to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I did notice that it
promoted ridiculously healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: My roots were growing quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: My roots were growing out of the holes in
the bottoms of my pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drainage holes, my roots were coming
out of there looking for somewhere else to
[SPEAKER_01]: go hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend who breaks down the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my harvested plants, he gets paid to
help me out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Mike was breaking down those root
balls, he asked me, dude, what have you
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing differently lately because
these things are amazing?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that I will attribute to the
secret sauce, the OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was doing a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really great for the early life
cycle of the plants and for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I went into flower, here's something
that I didn't realize was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed there was something weird and
somebody else pointed it out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in flower and I was feeding
OGT, I would feed it every other week.
[SPEAKER_01]: On those weeks, I would notice that my
plants would progress more into what looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like a nutrient deficiency on some
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had strains that I was feeding it just
like I have before and it looked like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was becoming nitrogen deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant couldn't keep up with itself and
it was just burning out really early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that to our friend,
Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that the only thing I was
using differently was the OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean said that the rocks phosphates that
they are using to produce the OGT speed up
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutritive cycle of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use this stuff,
I would only use it during the veg cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: and use it very sparingly during the
flowering cycle because when I used the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended dosage, it sped my plants up
almost too much and they weren't burned,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were growing so quickly and using
nutrients so quickly that they were eating
[SPEAKER_01]: all of their food for the week within the
first couple of the days and then starving
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves is what it looked like was
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my little rant on OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good product, but if you're going
to use it, be prepared and you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to adjust your feeding and you're
going to have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing that every time you
put a new product into your garden anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next question, I want to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I put it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next question comes from Periscope and
somebody asked me, and this is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take me a little bit to describe here,
but somebody said, what is solventless?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was talking about solventless on
Periscope and they did not have it in
[SPEAKER_01]: context, so let me try to describe to you
what solventless is.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, let me say that solventless is
a marketing term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solventless is owned by Nicka T of
Essential Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's owned by him,
but it is the marketing term that he has
[SPEAKER_01]: put on what he calls solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that being said, not all solventless
hash has to come from Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any hash that is made without a solvent
will be considered solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, in 99% of the cases in the
cannabis industry, I've never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else called non-solvent,
maybe dry sift, but that's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water hash or bubble hash is solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made with ice and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The solvents that we are using is BHO,
PHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple other gases that people
are using to extract hash with lately,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the propane and the butane are the
solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are going to say,
but water is a solvent as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, and I'm going to paraphrase
what Nicka T says all of the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: a big shout out to DJ Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about solventless hash,
water is not being used as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being used as a mechanical separator.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to dissolve the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to dissolve the plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just simply using it as a way to
wash the trichomes off of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solventless hash is basically hash made by
using ice or water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solventless made by DJ Nicka T is kept at
a certain temperature at all times,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it never gets warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never gets dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never hardens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always got a nice, greasy texture to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always real tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're talking about solventless,
let me describe a couple of other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: hash just to put that in perspective a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other types of hash that are super popular
right now that everybody talks about are
[SPEAKER_01]: BHO, which is butane honey oil,
or butane hash, or dabs, or shatter,
[SPEAKER_01]: or wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much the most popular right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course, there is live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin is basically, it is BHO that is
made from fresh frozen plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it is blasted through an obidose
machine by Emotec.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way that you can make live resin
is through an Emotec machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds crazy, but like I said
earlier, Nicka T has made the market
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing term solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boys at Emotec have come up with the
term live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless you're running it Emotec style
in an Emotec machine, you're not making
[SPEAKER_01]: live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are gonna hate on me for
that, but that is my theory, and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I've got time for one
more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question comes from Facebook,
and it's from our friend Bobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby is starting his first grow,
and he's asking if it is okay to use
[SPEAKER_01]: Miracle Grow plant food or Miracle Grow
soil for his cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys, I definitely have to say I
strongly recommend not using any Miracle
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow products in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Miracle Grow soil has time-released
fertilizers in it, which will last for up
[SPEAKER_01]: to six months, and you don't want nitrogen
being released into your plants for six
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend not using that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use something like a Fox Farms product or
a Roots Organics product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use something like that if you're a new
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a solid start.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not nutrients in it that are gonna
screw you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have things in it that will help you
out from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for the nutrients, if you are trying to
use Miracle Grow nutrients, I would throw
[SPEAKER_01]: those away right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of the plant food, head to your
hydro shop, head to Hydro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplies, and get yourself a basic two- or
three-part nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a bottle A, a bottle B of a
brand that sounds good to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys at the hydro shop can definitely
talk you through what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll help you pick a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just starting out, they're
mainly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say go with something like
Botanicare, Biobiz, something simple,
[SPEAKER_01]: just something with an A and a B.
[SPEAKER_01]: The General Organics or General
Hydroponics, Flora Nova stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of that stuff you want to go for,
it's pretty much all the same thing if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're starting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself an A and a B, maybe a Bloom
Booster, and then maybe some sugary or
[SPEAKER_01]: something to sweeten it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely get away from that Miracle
Grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the hydro shop, get something
designed, more toward cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you can control for each
cycle of your plants, because you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want the same nutrients from
beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a little bit of grow in the
beginning, and you're going to taper the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow off as you get into flower,
and you'll start using the Bloom solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go get something that's more designed
for the plants that you are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby, I hope that helps you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys that are thinking about Miracle
Grow Soil, I hope I got you away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, here's something to think about,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miracle Grow products are all from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from Scotts, and Scotts is a
Monsanto brand, and we do not want to
[SPEAKER_01]: support Monsanto, because Monsanto does
not support the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about where the products you're
buying are made, and who they affect,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the impact that you will have on the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I think that was
enough questions for one episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to thank everybody who sent
me questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to send questions to me via
email, if you want to hit me up on
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter, if you want to Facebook me,
however you want to get a question to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're one of my friends, if you're one
of the homies, feel free to send it to me
[SPEAKER_01]: via text message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can message me directly on Instagram,
on the iRegenetics Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I love the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love helping you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I got the show going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all of those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I'll be back next
week for another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a question from a listener asking,
what are the difference, or what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between THC and CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be one before that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a lot of putting
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work going into that
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if it'll be ready by the next
one, but I will definitely have it ready
[SPEAKER_01]: by number 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, I'm going to wrap up the
show.
