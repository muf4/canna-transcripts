[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 129 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coode, and the
entire Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be coming out on
April 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody is in the middle of a
happy, amazing celebration for the 420
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: With 420 being on a Wednesday,
I'm sure a lot of people started
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrating Friday evening, Friday at 420
when they got off work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're having a great 420 weekend,
wherever you are, whatever you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a fat blunt roll to hope
you're taking a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you've eaten some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're taking a fat bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you like to consume your cannabis,
I hope you are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird without the cannabis
cup here in Denver this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the party is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where everybody's going to
be, but I know where I am going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I will be at the Secret
Sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about the Secret
Sesh hosted by my friend, Adam Ill,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also heard a rumor DJ Juggie would be
DJing the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Secret Sesh
Colorado on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot do anything to get you tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough to get myself one
ticket because of course I am family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot help you get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do anything for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out how to find their Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are instructions on their
Instagram on how to try to get yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: into the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this airs, it may be full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about something that I saw
on the cannabis just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit related to the
cannabis cup not being here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a lot of people kind of
backed out on coming to Colorado without
[SPEAKER_00]: the giant cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to read an article from the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headline goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cypress Hills cannabis cup concert just
moved to a much smaller venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sub headline says, I think that's
called the byline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says fewer people will be getting
insane in the brain for 420 this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this article is by Ricardo Baca of
course from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, and the hits to the cannabis
cup in Colorado keep coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: First the US cannabis cup got booted from
its Denver adjacent home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's planned to stage a cup in
Southern Colorado fell apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then high times magazine's largest event
moved from Colorado for a greener,
[SPEAKER_00]: more lenient home in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the cups lone Colorado event,
a high time sponsored concert with Cypress
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill, George Clinton and others with a
cannabis cup award show tagged on is
[SPEAKER_00]: moving to a much smaller venue less than a
week before show time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with, excuse me, let me try that
sentence again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with the move to the smaller
venue tickets are still available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of playing the 6,500 capacity
first bank center in Broomfield,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cypress Hill concert and high times
award show is moving to the 1,700 capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: Ogden theater in Denver, according to
promoter AEG Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: All tickets for the first bank center are
good for the Ogden and a limited number of
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets remain and are on sale now
according to a media release.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tickets are $65.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bills other acts are George Clinton
and Parliament Funkadelic, Action Bronson
[SPEAKER_00]: and Kronix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you've heard Kronix on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might write it down to end of the show
with Kronix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put a little note on myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably end the podcast with Kronix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite reggae artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kronix with two X's at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't gonna go to this show you guys
because it was at the first bank center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a big event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a big venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're up in the front of those big
venues, it's just a party and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even really get to see the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The artist I wanna see is the least known
artist on the big stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill, so he's going to play first.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll probably get like 30 minutes to
play, but in a small venue like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be worth it for me to go,
when you're 6'5 and you got dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_00]: down to your ass and a reggae band starts
playing and you know all the words and you
[SPEAKER_00]: walk from the front, people move the fuck
out of your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just go right up front and
check out Kronix and then I'd be gone by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I might check out Action Bronson
and Parliament Funkadelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'd stick around and see the
rest of it if I paid 65 for a ticket,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just wanna go see Kronix you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a great time in that little tiny
club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna continue with this, I'm gonna
read the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so why didn't the event sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely the lack of accompanying Cannabis
Cup Expo didn't help ticket sales and with
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoop Dogg playing Fiddler's Green,
Wiz Khalifa and Lil Wayne playing the 420
[SPEAKER_00]: rally and Method Man and Redman playing
Red Rocks all in the same week,
[SPEAKER_00]: competition is no doubt fierce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this venue downsizing indicative of the
420 to come?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too early to say, but Colorado will
surely see fewer cannabis tourists this
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 because of the cups move west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends that normally would
come out to Colorado for the 420 weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: from California, from Oregon, from
Washington, from Michigan, from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the damn place, from North Carolina,
they are not coming out because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of vendors that I'd like
to hang out with that probably I will not
[SPEAKER_00]: see this year because we usually bump into
each other either at the Cannabis Cup or
[SPEAKER_00]: Age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless they're at Age in the winter or
the fall time, I will not see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Oil Slick crew,
Handmade crew, the Hitman Glass crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: Task and Highly Educated, everybody that
shows up at all the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one group in my head that I'm
thinking of that I cannot think of,
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B and the No Goo crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I forget about those guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: See all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to miss seeing them at the cup
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B, I hear you'll be on the road
with the Goo Mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: HapCant, Jules, all kinds of folks that
I'm not going to get to see because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm just ranting and screaming
about not getting a Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a little bitch suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit whining about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concert, you guys, it sounds like a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've moved it to this small venue,
but they did put out a press release and
[SPEAKER_00]: it says, you cannot medicate in this
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be no ganja smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say that kind of shit at these
events, but this venue is tiny and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can see you from all angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one person starts puffing and then two
people start and then the whole place is
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking, they can't kick everybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you never know what
they're going to try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say no smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably just let you do it in
there anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burping while I'm recording a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dr. Pepper, 23 flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that was my news
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read any more news in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and close that web browser
and we will go ahead and focus on some
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode about listener emails and
that spawned more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me a message about a
probiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that I like to consume
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like kombuchas and fermented products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're good for digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some stomach problems, which is
part of why I have a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody really wants to hear
about my medical conditions, but my
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach is messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wrecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel like my food digest
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel like my body's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your gut health has a lot to do
with your mental health and your physical
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all starts in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probiotics and good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our listeners sent me an email
asking about a specific probiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to tell you the truth, I lost the
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot find where that message came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find it on the Facebook pages,
the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find it in any of my emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked if I had heard about a product
or if I am familiar with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I've never heard of that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I intended to save the message you sent
and go and research that product and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you what I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I don't know what happened
to the damn message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sent me that message,
let's do this easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me it again on an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I'll find it and I will read your
email again and I will research that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize for losing the damn
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drove me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent about two hours just searching for
that email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, not all at one time,
but I put about two hours into looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing probably and I can't find the
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it again, I will answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, our next email comes from,
I'm opening the message right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he wants me to say his
name so I'm not gonna, but it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a new listener to the show and I gotta
say I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very thankful for the wealth of
information you provide and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable guests you bring on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am listening from another state at the
moment, but have plans on moving to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado soon to get involved in the
industry any way I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to the episode about the MED
badges and I just had a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have your med badge, does that mean
you can go into a medical dispensary as a
[SPEAKER_00]: customer to buy products as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that a different car?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes sense, but thanks again
for everything and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting you one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I look forward to meeting you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to take some fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully smoke some flowers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see what kind of flowers
you are getting in your location and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show you what kind of flowers we've got
here and we can smoke down together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a new listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go back and listen to a
few of the older episodes if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to, I think it's 50, 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's an episode about scheduling
your grow, scheduling a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's episodes about building your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly recommend listening to some of
those more educational, in-depth,
[SPEAKER_00]: informative episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did you say here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main question is the MED badge,
does it work like a Colorado red card or a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The red cards are now purple, which is a
drastic change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado MED badge does not work the
same as your Colorado medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot shop in a medical marijuana
facility just because your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not work like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your badge, will get you some discounts at
other dispensaries if you shop at a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gets you into some of the smoke
lounges for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I wear my badge to the
Canna Canyon, Camille does not charge me
[SPEAKER_00]: to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Camille has never charged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever charged me to get into the
Canna Canyon because I do advertising and
[SPEAKER_00]: I show love to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have an MED badge, they will
not charge you to get into the Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Canyon is where most people would pay $5
at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some perks of having the
badge, just some industry perks,
[SPEAKER_00]: some friendly things that come,
but it does not work as a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a medical marijuana recommendation
to get into a medical marijuana facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do need to see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doctor involved in the MED
paperwork and questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will mention, if you do have a
Colorado medical marijuana card,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use that card in Las Vegas in the
state of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada has medical marijuana and they do a
reciprocal program where other states
[SPEAKER_00]: cards work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a tourist and you are in Las
Vegas or if you're in the state of Nevada,
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go to the bunny ranch,
you can stop and grab yourself some ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to Nevada for being a
reciprocating state on the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana recommendation cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the listener interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Facebook message from a friend
of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me basically what stops
people or is it possible for somebody to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a package of cigarettes or other drugs
or whatever they're buying to keep their
marijuana out of use?
So I'm going to read this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, I'd love it if you could also
take a couple of seeds and grow some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out of it and then call those
plants something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then enter cannabis cups or other
competitions with something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: claim is something they bred but is
actually something that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased from a seed bank or they got a
clone from somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that is nothing is
stopping that other than our community and
[SPEAKER_00]: people's morals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, if I sold you seeds of any
strain that I bred, you could take them
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could wait three or four months until
everybody forgot that you had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could say, Hey, look what I
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could name it your whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Arrowhead water bottles in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say, you could say you
bred your Arrowhead and you can call it
[SPEAKER_00]: this Arrowhead and you could enter it into
cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to fool a lot of people,
but you won't fool the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really into the industry that know what
strain is what strain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are guys, when we go to cannabis
cups, you can smoke a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will pass you a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these guys will say,
Oh, is that Aaron's OG Kush that he grew
[SPEAKER_00]: over there at the clinic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people know what these flowers taste
like, look like, smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're catching on all the stuff that
stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few things that stand out
enough to be cup winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we smoke these things,
we notice them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We remember the flavor, remember the high,
and then when we smoke it again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you try to pass it off as something
else, somebody in the circle is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: notice, but honestly, 90% of the people in
the world would be fooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will believe you, but the only thing
stopping you from doing it is having some
[SPEAKER_00]: morals and not being a cannabis dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the year exactly,
but I do remember that several years back,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a person who bought a bunch of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember where he purchased the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he bought it from a coffee shop in
Amsterdam or from a grower in Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he entered it into the cannabis cup in
Amsterdam, the original cannabis cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he walked around and persuaded people
at the cup to vote for him as the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of bought votes from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a legitimately won cannabis cup,
but these guys won a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of stole a cup from DNA genetics
by buying another professional grower's
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and putting their name on it and
marketing it as their name to create their
[SPEAKER_00]: new seed company, to make hype on their
seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the people, most of the folks
in Amsterdam knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that were voting for them were
mostly tourists and people that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: really familiar with the weed game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the people that, all the local
Amsterdam had smoked it and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Hey, this is whatever's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew whose haze it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew exactly, but these guys called
it Uki Kabuki.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fucking won a cannabis cup by
stealing a strain, renaming it and
[SPEAKER_00]: entering it into the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then persuading other people to vote
for it by kind of buying votes,
[SPEAKER_00]: by giving them weed, by talking to them,
by kissing their asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually kind of a documentary on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to Google it and look for it,
hold on and go find the name for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I did a little bit of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can find is some stuff on ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out icmag.com,
join the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says in 2007, Hager produced a reality
TV show based around the High Times
[SPEAKER_00]: offices titled High Times Office.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show's 12th episode culminated in the
20th cannabis cup where Big Apple Seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from Brooklyn, New York won a blind taste
test against DNA seeds that was judged by
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was later revealed in High Times that
Doc and Dom, the owners of Big Apple Seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: were actors and their entry, Uki Kabuki,
was actually Neville Hayes purchased in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam from a pot broker with a good
nose for good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was posted up on ICMAG from a
poster, calls himself Saluki.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks like he's well known on this
place here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out, just read part of your post.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are, but you just got
to shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a legend of Uki Kabuki and how
that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of rumors on how that
went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what I found on this one
forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of brings back a lot of memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original question was, can somebody
steal a strain and rename it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, these people didn't even
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought it and then entered it into
the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Neville Hayes, which is always
going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best strains on the
planet when grown properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I want to give a
huge shout out to our friends at Nugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nugs 303, Denver's newest dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at 3899
Quinton Street in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're open Monday through Sunday,
10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are currently only a medical cannabis
facility in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have a recreational side of the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be able to serve iRegenetics
products to the entire recreational market
[SPEAKER_00]: that is coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Nugs in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow their Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nugs.303.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a question about seed pack
labeling and flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're looking at seed packs
online, you look at a package and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: say flowering time, usually 56 to 63 days
is what most packages will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will say 60 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're writing the truth on
there, but usually it's eight to nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and they'll indicate that by the
number of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what that number is, is the flowering
time, unless you've got auto flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got auto flower plants,
this does not apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got regular photo period
plants, this is what that number means.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a breeder labels his package of seeds
and it says that this plant takes whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to nine weeks or 56 to 63 days to
finish, that is the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long that plant is going to
take to reach full maturity from the time
[SPEAKER_00]: you initiate the flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is when the very, from the very
first day you turn that timer to 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, when the lights go from 12 hours on to
12 hours off, that is now day one of that
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nine week period that's written on
the package has nothing to do with your
[SPEAKER_00]: veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sprout them as seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them like two inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can flower them if you want
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be 20 days or you can sprout
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg them for 12 weeks and take a
million clones and then flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're going to do with
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder doesn't know either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the only one that knows what you're
going to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the veg time is as long as you want it
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering time is what is indicated on
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it begins the day you turn those
lights to 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that breeder pack says that the
plants are going to take 56 to 63 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually recommend going the full 63 days
unless it's completely obvious that that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to be done earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of course, some phenotypes are
going to finish sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to finish a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to push them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a plant won't start putting on
its bulk until the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be cutting yourself out of some
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be cutting yourself out of
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those plants will just throw on
a whole nother layer of trichomes right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you might be missing
if you cut down too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the package says that it could go
nine weeks, let it go nine full weeks on
[SPEAKER_00]: the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully you've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you get to pick your favorite
phenotype out of that seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to run it again, and then you get
to dial in exactly how many days to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your first run with the plant is
just an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to see what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my take on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time indicated on the pack is how long
the plant will flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when you're
purchasing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a reputable seed
vendor in the United States, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend the dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The D-A-N-K-T-E-A-M.com, the dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got things from Gage Green
Genetics, Sour Seeds, Mile High,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of great stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may even have some Airy Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to go and take a look for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question actually came from a friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cultivar, there's a clone,
there's a varietal, there's a strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a plant that goes around our
region that is a sour diesel clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it is grown properly,
you cannot keep it in a baggie,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put it in a baggie inside of a
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hide this weed from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it in a baggie, in a jar,
and in your car, you can smell this sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel outside of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some super loud weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I give it to a lot of my friends,
they cannot grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself cannot grow this strain worth a
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know three or four people that grow this
strain fucking amazingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyxes swell up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets that gassy fuel funk smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me being the inquisitive guy that I am,
I know a few guys that grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked them, I was like, hey,
how do you grow that sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all three of the people that grow it
successfully have told me that it grows in
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that leads me to think,
these guys, myself included, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow this cultivar, this clone,
this varietal, this plant, this strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a soil or soilless mix, we're not going
to have much success because this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: was probably phenohunted from a pack of
seeds by somebody that grows in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant was selected for a hydroponic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody growing it,
and this could be wrong, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people growing it in soil are
ever going to bring out that flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma that my friends in the hydroponic
system are getting because I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants like hydro and some plants
like soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a perfect example of
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower that found this plant probably
grows hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he thought, look at this amazing plant
that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he gave it to all of us soil
growers and we're just frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some strains, and I keep
saying all these different words,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're known as different things in
different circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will call them varietals and you'll
hear cultivar also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say strains or clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains or clones or plants are just
not simply going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that if you took one of my
soil plants and you tried to grow that in
[SPEAKER_00]: a hydroponic system, you may not have as
stellar results as you would have in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just some plants are going to like
some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think is going on with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Los for asking me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of told him the same thing and he
scratched his head and looked at me like I
[SPEAKER_00]: was a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would share that with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that's enough
emails for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple more emails that I will
read on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I get into one of them
today, it will be way too long of a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, there is one email I can
definitely reply to right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me an email asking about
cannabis and sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, can you talk about cannabis and
sex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my take on cannabis and sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, somebody else also sent me an
email about cannabis and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to know about the pros and
cons and the advantages and disadvantages
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis use during pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I am not well educated in that
subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to do some research and I
will try to get you an episode that
[SPEAKER_00]: features a little bit about cannabis and
pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get that out to you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do it soon because it sounds like
somebody might be pregnant right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope mama is happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope the baby's healthy and I hope daddy
is doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that pretty much wraps up this
episode.
