[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 385 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Goat Power
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This smells just like Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes just like Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has got that sativa punch that
Golden Goat brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a big fan of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 74.8% THC with a
total of 86.4% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like smoking the Goat Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets my brain fired up and it tastes
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quality concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
another Grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we are going to do week 7,
through 9, we are wrapping up the Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about the final
weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work our way into flushing and a
little bit of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been following along,
I recommend you go back to episode 351 and
[SPEAKER_00]: start listening to the Grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an experienced grower or if
you've been following along or if you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like you were up to speed, let's jump
right into this Grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of the flowering cycle,
we are entering what I call the third
[SPEAKER_00]: trimester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our plants are going to take
between 8 and 10 weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 9 weeks is a good template to set
up these Grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are going to take more than
9 weeks, I suggest you extend my advice
[SPEAKER_00]: for week 7 one more week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just repeat the week 7 feeding,
the temperature, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just repeat week 7 one more time if you've
got a longer flowering cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand if you're growing from
seed, you may not know how long your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to pay attention to
the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to be prepared to
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 or 14 days before harvest,
this is going to take a close eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay attention to your
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes when I'm running seeds that are
brand new and I don't know what to expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: I already decided they're going 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let them flower 70 days and see
what they give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I decide 70 days was too long,
I can run them less time next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to give them the opportunity to
show me what could happen if I go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really like to bulk up that
last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really put on some extra
trichomes that final week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really don't do shit for that
last week except over ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn your
specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, you will discover that 9
weeks is just about right for most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will take 10 weeks if you want to get
them perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are ready in 8 weeks, which is really
advantageous because that puts us a week
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can produce another crop in a
commercial environment that really helps
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for these lessons, we're going to
focus on a 9 week cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now at the start of week 7 in
our flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, the buds are starting to
get really fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be getting really sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be putting off some very nice
aromas by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be starting to make some very
nice colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing from seed, different
phenotypes will start becoming very
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious at this point in the flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one phenotype that has gotten
way taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a phenotype that has stayed
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one that is way branchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will really start seeing the different
traits now that we are later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week 7 is what I call the fill week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds will really start filling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes will really start getting
dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the photos really start
getting hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think weeks 6 through 9 are great for
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only gets better as we go on until it
is time for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out your camera and take some great
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get good beefy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get good trichome
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soon, you're going to start getting
those sweet fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus in on the environmental
conditions for our grow room in week 7 of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buds are getting big and beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to reduce the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have too much humidity in the room,
we do run the risk of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run the risk of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's reduce the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring it down to around 30 or 40%
relative humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help us reduce the risk of bud
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first change is that we should
reduce the humidity by 5 to 10% if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I would recommend is to
reduce the temperature by just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been running our flowering room
somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to knock that down just 3 to
5 degrees if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get it 77 to 75 degrees in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the weeks go on, I would like to
reduce it about 3 to 5 degrees every week
[SPEAKER_00]: until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this week, let's drop it down by 3
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already at 80 degrees,
let's get it down to 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're down at 77, let's crank it down
about 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make these plants think that winter
is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That colder environment will bring out
more colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That colder environment will bring out
more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That colder environment will make your
buds more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it also speeds up the
finishing time of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make it just a little bit colder
during week 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about our nutrients for
week 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be our last opportunity
for feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start reducing our base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need as much nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have in the past, you can almost
eliminate the nitrogen at this phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to overfeed them,
but we do want to make sure that they get
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice boost for their last feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you include some phosphorus
and potassium to make those buds swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also include some Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too hard on the Kalmag at this
point because it is really hard to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and you may taste it if you go too
hard with Kalmag at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always encourage a kelp product
this late in flower that will add to your
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like an enzymatic product this late
in flower because it keeps my root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use a microbe product this late in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mentioned that we should taper off
the microbes and start increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your budget will allow,
I would include microbe products this late
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing to focus on on this feeding
is one final bloom booster feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what product you're using as
a bloom booster, but this is probably your
[SPEAKER_00]: last opportunity to add that bloom booster
to your nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you get that in there at this
feeding time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last week to fertilize our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week we are going to begin the
flushing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to boost those plants up
one last time, if you've been saving one
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of something or one little scoop of
something, this is the last time to
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize those plants because at the
start of week eight we are going to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point in the game we've got
big fat chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have to say this, but I want
to remind everybody it is too late to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray any pesticides on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are coming down in 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the plants to taste like
anything we applied as a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not spray your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also do not use a sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned that in previous episodes
using a sulfur burner at this point in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower will make your plants taste like
total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will taste like smoking a pack of
matches or it will taste like smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: can of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please turn off the sulfur burner and
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish everybody would just get rid of the
sulfur burner and find out what is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually causing the problem and cure the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no pesticides, no sulfur burners this
late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is acceptable is predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a pest issue, release an
excessive amount of predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've been on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't have a problem,
but I understand shit happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predator bugs are the way to go at this
stage of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little sachets that you hang,
the little tea bag looking things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too late for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the live predators that are ready
to release, that are hungry, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to get in there and destroy your
spider mites or whatever pest you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the live active bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more expensive,
but they're the only thing that are
[SPEAKER_00]: effective at this stage of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, do not spray anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use a sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do see any insects,
any pests, get in there with some predator
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs and hopefully those predators will
eradicate your infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see any signs of pests,
remove any infested leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark the plant so that you know where that
infestation was and come check frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you can to minimize the problem in
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the game, I also suggest
you defoliate any yellow or funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaves that look unhealthy are pest
attractants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get those dead funky leaves out of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate anything that is obvious that
needs to come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some nice fall looking
colors and you want to leave those pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on there for photos, you can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the minute it starts getting crunchy
and it is dead, decaying matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to come off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is OK to have a few dead leaves at this
point in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a full grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a full canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some dead funky leaves in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a leaf just doesn't get enough
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a branch gets bumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have some funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is excessive, you may have a problem
that needs to be diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a few funky leaves at this stage are
not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing we should keep our eyes
open for at this stage of the game are
[SPEAKER_00]: late flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top buds of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the middle buds of the plants and
definitely look at the lower part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant where you are not getting a lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any male flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what a male flower looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you identify a hermaphrodite flower
if it walked up and bit you on the nose?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I recommend you do a little bit of
Google research and know what a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite flower looks like so you do
not allow them to happen in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point of the game, we still
need to keep our eyes open for pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need to keep an eye out for
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've spoken in a previous episode
about how to handle the herms if you
[SPEAKER_00]: should get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it with some water and think of your
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remove the male flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remove the bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remove the branch or do you
want to get rid of that whole plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to make decisions
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is just one little hermaphrodite
flower, I would spray it with water,
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it out with tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two or three that are on one
bud, maybe cut that bud or that branch
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got several hermaphrodite
flowers popping up in different spots on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, it may be time to get rid of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of things to think about
because this late in flower, will those
[SPEAKER_00]: male flowers do anything to the rest of
your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just running, one flowering
cycle, you're probably too late into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow to seed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a perpetual cycle going on,
those plants that are earlier in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: may be ready to receive that pollen should
that hermaphrodite release pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do have a hermaphroditic plant
in your grow room, don't give clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: that to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't pass out hermaphrodite clones
to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to continue to grow it,
that is fine, but don't give a herm out to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're setting them up for failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do that to our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the last things I have written down
for week seven is plenty of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of airflow in the grow room
as these buds start getting chunkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need more fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see every leaf move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need every plant and every leaf
getting beat down by the wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want every leaf just to get a little
rustle occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the fans oscillate, I want every fan to
just feel that fresh air, just change that
[SPEAKER_00]: air around my leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know the environment is getting
shuffled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a bunch of CO2 in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a bunch of humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packed up over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mix that air all day long and
keep that air fresh for my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have plenty of airflow in your grow
as we get late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next thing I want to talk about
is kind of preparing us for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plan to cut this crop down in
approximately 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have seeds or clones prepared for
your next run?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have another grow space,
now is the time to get your seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: clones prepared for your next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we don't have a bunch of
downtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way as soon as these plants are
harvested, you can move fresh plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: into that grow room and never miss a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I do plan on updating my
perpetual grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did write a very long perpetual grow
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is episode 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in scheduling a
perpetual grow, go check out episode 73,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will update that because in
Colorado, we have made quite a few changes
[SPEAKER_00]: to our laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to write a perpetual grow episode
based around our Colorado plant count
[SPEAKER_00]: limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is coming in the future,
but let's focus on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get plants prepared for your
next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got an available veg space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is the time to buy clones or
acquire clones from either your fellow
[SPEAKER_00]: growers or a dispensary or however you get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or now is the time to start germinating
seeds and getting them started so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when that grow room is empty, we can clean
it up and we can refill it and you never
[SPEAKER_00]: miss a day in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the basics of week seven of the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move right into week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week eight, we want to continue to
reduce the temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that humidity down between 25
and 35% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will make it a little bit dry in the
room for the last two weeks, but it will
[SPEAKER_00]: also help us prevent powdery mildew and
boy tritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get mold right up the
center of our big giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by reducing the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we can do is we can reduce
the temperature by three to five degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point of the phase, I would like
to be somewhere between 70 and 74 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit during the lights on cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now week eight is what I call the final
swell week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see your buds take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start becoming covered in
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to really start paying
attention to your trichomes with a 60 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 X powered microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get in there and look at those
trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what color they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting that milky whitish blue
color?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they started becoming amber?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how you determine the ripeness of
your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to get in there and start
paying close attention to the trichomes on
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these plants are also going to be
super sticky and super stinky,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they should also be putting off some
amazing colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is another great opportunity to
take more photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we enter the flush phase, we will start
seeing more colors come from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start removing nutrients
from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to push some of the color out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the green is going to disappear,
which will allow room for reds and golds
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of great colors that you didn't
know were coming from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be an exciting two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've reduced the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reduced the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's start flushing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done an entire episode on flushing
our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode 320.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into great detail quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain how and why we flush for
the past at least nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been shoving nutrients into these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are filled with a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want to smoke all of those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are stored in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are stored within that plant by
flushing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are starving it of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make that plant use up all of the
nutrients stored within its systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also remove all of the nutrients
from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically want to wash out the
medium to make no nutrients available,
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow that plant to starve itself so
that it will use up all of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that is stored over its flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing the nutrients from all of the
buds, it will make the buds burn and smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are properly dried and cured,
we still need to get all the way through a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard harvest and drying cure phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, flushing is the first
step to getting a tasty final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water the plants, don't add any
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust the pH somewhere between
6.2 and 6.5 and just water the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: until you get 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pour in a gallon of water in a pot,
you want 20% of that gallon to run right
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bottom of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a few heavy waterings and you
will wash out all of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just continue to water until harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is simple and it is free and it will
make your plants taste so much better if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever smoked flowers that taste
like you just stuck your tongue in a light
[SPEAKER_00]: socket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are those buds were not flushed
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person did not allow a 10 to 14 day
flush phase before he harvested his plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and now they taste like complete shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it a couple times already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you want to do free shit to your
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use nutrients and it
saves time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is fill the container
with water, adjust the pH, pour it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: damn plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flush the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we're going to focus on in
weeks eight through nine is flushing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for harvest so that they taste good
once we dry and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before I harvest, I like to do a
pre-harvest defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally like to do this seven to 10
days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may happen in the middle of week
eight or at the beginning of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf that has a petiole that I can
grab, I just go in there and peel it right
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a bunch of leaves at this
point of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves have done their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time to cut down these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make the harvest crews job just
a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to go through and pull off all
of the big leaves seven to 10 days before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a good way to segue us right
into week number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of week nine,
if you haven't done it already,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to go in there and pull off all
of the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves have done their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take them off of there and get them
out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the environmental
conditions in our grow room for week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the final week of our flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to reduce the humidity to
approximately 25 to 30% humidity at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buds are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buds are chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to risk bud rot in the
middle of those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reduce that humidity down to about
25% relative humidity in my flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to get it nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get it about 70 to 74 degrees for
the last week of flower, that really will
[SPEAKER_00]: make the colors pop out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make them more dense and it will
give you more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think the plants pack on a
little beef once it gets colder and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will also speed them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like making it nice and cold at the
end of the season tricks our plants into
[SPEAKER_00]: believing it is fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh, I don't have a lot of time
left to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really start doing everything they
can do to ripen up and reach the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I try to make it a little
colder in the grow room at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that a lot of growers like
to do at the end of a flowering cycle is
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently you're probably running 12 on
and 12 off toward the end of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always reduce it to 10 on and 14
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing your light cycle will also make
the plants think that the end is near.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will speed up a little bit and they
will finish more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that having it a little bit cooler
and having a little less light in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the plants finish a little sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes them pack on a little more
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the buds a little more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I think it gives us a little more
terpene presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are destroyed by light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are destroyed by warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not give them a little cool and a
little dark and we can have a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also saving a little bit of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using nutrients because we're
flushing and now we're running the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: for two hours less per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're saving electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saving the electricity on running
the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus we're probably saving a little bit of
electricity on cooling since we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to cool to fight those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're saving electricity and we're also
saving time on our gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not reduce the lights just a couple
of hours at the last week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a little secret that I haven't
shared with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that takes way too
long to flower and you need to speed it up
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit, you can reduce those
lights by four hours at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and those plants will finish
approximately a week earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a 10 week strain or an 11
week strain and at the end of week nine
[SPEAKER_00]: you crank those lights down to eight hours
on and 16 hours off, that plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: finish one solid week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may not get the harvest weight you
would get if you let it go for that full
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 or 12 week period, but sometimes we
just need the plants to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is always a trick you can use to
speed up some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have reduced humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reduced our temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have reduced our light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on the final home stretch here in
week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, please do not apply any
pesticides or any foliar feeds to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants this late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ruin the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week is our final bulking and
ripening week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see that final bulk come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting fat and chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your leaves are going to start
getting yellow and starting to droop down
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a little crinkly because we've
been flushing and hopefully you're paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to those trichomes because this
is when the trichomes are really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start turning amber and showing their
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week nine is the bulk and ripen week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time to chop down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep a close eye on the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide the plants are not done and
you want to let them go a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, you can let them flower for an
extra week and you don't have to give them
[SPEAKER_00]: any more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess your whole cycle up by adding
nutrients in and then trying to cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down seven days later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already been flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already doing it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess it up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it needs to go longer, let it go
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are early in flower and you
anticipate you may need an extra week or
[SPEAKER_00]: two, again, repeat my advice from week
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week seven is where you extend your
schedule if you're going to go longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's act like we are right on
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ending up week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have defoliated the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't ran into any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to think about is do you
have your harvest and drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: area prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for a sticky, stinky,
time consuming and space consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cut down the plants, where are
you going to hang them?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be there for at least a
week, maybe seven to 14 days, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have space for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will people be showing up when people show
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to smell your hanging
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to plan ahead to keep that
aroma away from visitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to do something to keep
intruders and thieves away from that
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to say, hey, it's the time
to cut down these plants and walk in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with scissors and cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, the next step in my
grow lessons is harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next step is to harvest these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is only followed by drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next step after that is to clean
and reset our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've made it this far,
you are one episode from cutting down your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, all we've got to do is
dry it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the step after that is finally
sampling our finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've made it all the way through
nine weeks of flowering without any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did run into issues, I hope you
were able to solve those problems without
[SPEAKER_00]: messing up your crop.
