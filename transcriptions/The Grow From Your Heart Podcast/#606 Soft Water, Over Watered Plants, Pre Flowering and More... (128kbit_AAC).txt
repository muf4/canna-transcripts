[SPEAKER_00]: All right, big thanks to everybody who
supports us on patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of things to talk about
before we get to the email portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question I wanted to answer is
why do I post their premiere on YouTube at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast comes out on mid at midnight
on Sunday night into Monday morning or at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight on Wednesday night into Thursday
morning and there's a good reason for that
[SPEAKER_00]: many people have said hey I want to hang
out and watch the premiere on YouTube but
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it because it is simply too
late which I understand we have a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: group that hangs out on the Patreon the
YouTube premiere if you're not aware when
[SPEAKER_00]: the video does premiere there is a chat
that goes along with the video we hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: we chat live I hang out the people in the
chat I take some dabs and answer their
[SPEAKER_00]: questions in the chat it's a nice little
crew that hangs out in there many people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to hang out but unfortunately it is
just too late for them let me explain to
[SPEAKER_00]: you why I post the video at midnight this
podcast started off as a as an audio only
[SPEAKER_00]: format there was no video when this
podcast first started I was putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: show up at midnight on Sunday night or
into Monday morning so that when people
[SPEAKER_00]: got up for work on Monday they had
something to brighten their day many
[SPEAKER_00]: people have to drive to work they don't
feel like driving many people have to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a commute to work they don't
feel like making a lot of people have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to a job they don't want to be at many
people have a job they enjoy but listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to the grow from your heart podcast on a
Monday morning will always make your day
[SPEAKER_00]: better so my goal was to have the podcast
available for everybody Monday morning if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on the East Coast get up real early
it's already there it came out at midnight
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's up probably I guess that's two or
three o'clock on the East Coast if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting up for work at four four thirty
five in the morning the show was there
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting also twelve o'clock gave me the
opportunity to make sure that the show
[SPEAKER_00]: posted successfully back in the day there
would be some technical issues and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't get the show posted properly I'd
have to run to my computer do some
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments fix some file names or file
numbers or whatever needed to be corrected
[SPEAKER_00]: in the website service then that would get
the show posted now I'm more confident
[SPEAKER_00]: that the show will work at midnight but I
didn't feel like changing the time for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of reasons I am available at
midnight I'm available to be there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: premiere I also think that midnight was a
fair time to release the show so I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize if you're on the East Coast or
somewhere else and you can't catch the
[SPEAKER_00]: premiere on YouTube but that was my
intention was to get the show up at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight so that everybody can watch it
the next day it'll be ready for you no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what time you get up I've
considered changing the time for the
[SPEAKER_00]: premiere but it doesn't seem fair to the
people who have been joining me since the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning and also it doesn't work
perfectly for my schedule I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can be available before midnight on
a Sunday night I know that Sunday night at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight I'm available everybody else is
in bed everyone else is getting ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: work I've got the house to myself some
time to hang out I know that I can get
[SPEAKER_00]: there for those premieres so I apologize
if you're unable to make the premiere at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight and that is my reasoning behind
doing it at midnight also a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: say they missed the live show at midnight
it's not really live it's pre-recorded I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: recording it's Tuesday afternoon right now
and I'm recording this show will come out
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday at midnight Thursday morning ish
a lot of people say they wish they could
[SPEAKER_00]: join the live it is not a live show it is
just a live premiere the video plays I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in front of my computer at home
watching on YouTube just like you but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the chat hopefully just like
you that was a really long explanation as
[SPEAKER_00]: to why I post the premieres at midnight
but that is why there was a reason to it
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a method to my madness it
started off as an audio show there was
[SPEAKER_00]: never a video there was never a premiere
the audio came out at midnight so
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody could listen on their drive to
work on Monday then it became a video show
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just never changed the time that's
simply what happened I like being free at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight I can hang out in the chat also
if there's a technical issue I can repair
[SPEAKER_00]: it at midnight I've got time to myself I'm
basically alone at midnight most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time everybody else is sleeping I've got
the house to myself so midnight was
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect for me I apologize if it doesn't
work for you if that doesn't work for you
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you can catch me on my Monday night
Instagram live show every Monday around
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 Mountain Time I go on Instagram live
and I hang out I listen to some music I
[SPEAKER_00]: chat with the entire audience there are
usually about 50 to 75 people that come
[SPEAKER_00]: into my Instagram live video and if you
ask a question on the IG live I do my best
[SPEAKER_00]: to answer it on the fly I don't have any
notes I don't have any preparation I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any warning it is kind of like stump
the breeder stump the grower or just hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out with the dabber however you want to do
it I invite you Monday at 7 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time that's Colorado time I don't
know where you are I don't know your time
[SPEAKER_00]: zone you're gonna have to do some time
zone conversions but Monday at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time I am on Instagram I use Iri
underscore genetics as my Instagram name
[SPEAKER_00]: follow that account watch for me to pop up
Mondays around 7 10 all right I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: that took a long time to get over that
brief note I've got one more thing I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about before we get into the
emails I got a message from my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy hand grows and it's simply says I
would just love a shout out sometime and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a little bit of help to grow my
channel well here you go crazy hands I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a friend named crazy hands grows who
is a great grower he's a great person I
[SPEAKER_00]: invite you to check out his YouTube
channel it is not as intense and in-depth
[SPEAKER_00]: as my channel it's a little more
light-hearted it's a little more fun it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little laid-back but I do think that my
friend crazy hands grows does deserve your
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription so go check out my buddy
crazy hands grows crazy hand grows on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube let me make sure it's crazy hands
or crazy hand it's just crazy hand grows
[SPEAKER_00]: go give him a subscribe on YouTube let him
know Rasta Jeff sent you support the
[SPEAKER_00]: community there's no need to just watch my
videos we can watch everyone's go check
[SPEAKER_00]: out crazy hand grows on YouTube shout out
to my buddy crazy hand all right where are
[SPEAKER_00]: we going from there let's talk about the
silver thio sulfate update in a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode I talked about making our own
feminized seed reversal spray I listened
[SPEAKER_00]: back to it during the premiere and I
realized I may have skipped a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: minor details everything I told you will
work you'll be successful with the advice
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plan I gave you but here are a few
more things that may set you up for better
[SPEAKER_00]: success with your silver thio sulfate um
get the powdered silver thio sulfate mix
[SPEAKER_00]: the the sodium nitrate and the thio
sulfate which ones are what are they
[SPEAKER_00]: called here the silver nitrate and the
sodium thio sulfate get the powdered
[SPEAKER_00]: versions a couple of people said they
found the liquid version on Amazon or
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else get the powdered version I
don't like the chunks I don't like the big
[SPEAKER_00]: parts I like the fine powder so get those
powders those powders should be white when
[SPEAKER_00]: you open them up if they are a dark color
they are starting to degrade I would not
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend using the darker colored powders
if they've turned dark on you if they've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten brown or gray do not use those they
should be pure white in my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: they've always been pure white I find
lower quality less results when I use
[SPEAKER_00]: darker colored materials also if the water
turns dark when you mix the solution
[SPEAKER_00]: something has gone wrong you've got some
contaminants and particulates in there the
[SPEAKER_00]: water should stay clear when you start
mixing everything up it'll go dark when
[SPEAKER_00]: you put the shit in right away because you
just added stuff to it but once it all
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolves it should be clear I highly
recommend that you use glass containers
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime you're pouring the water into
anything doing any mixing use a glass
[SPEAKER_00]: container and I said in the episode that I
use a butter knife for stirring the butter
[SPEAKER_00]: knife is metal nothing's going to stick to
it I'm not going to add anything I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take anything out of my mix it's
non porous it doesn't have other shit on
[SPEAKER_00]: it so use clean glass containers clean
them thoroughly use clean glass containers
[SPEAKER_00]: and use something metal or sterile for
stirring I use the butter knife simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have it it's sitting around it's
right in the kitchen I can clean it very
[SPEAKER_00]: well nothing sticks to it it's non porous
use glass and metal if possible then I
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommend using distilled water I
don't know if I went over that in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode I highly recommend distilled water
we were trying to mix up a solution here
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can add certain things to our plants
we don't need other elements other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals other variables in our mix we're
trying to make silver thiosulfate not
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate plus whatever was in
the water you started with or whatever was
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck to your previous container do
everything super clean all right so the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to store your silver thiosulfate
here's something I did not cover it stores
[SPEAKER_00]: separately it stores better separately I
said to mix the one powder into 500 mils
[SPEAKER_00]: of water and another powder into 500
milliliters of water if you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to use all of the solution you're making
it is easily stored by not mixing those
[SPEAKER_00]: two together it will last longer if you
don't mix parts A and B if you have mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: parts A and B they will still store just
fine but you get a longer shelf life in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion if you do not mix them so keep
parts A and part B separately mix them
[SPEAKER_00]: when needed then dilute and use as needed
if you've already mixed them that is just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine that will store just as well but not
for as long in my opinion over time it
[SPEAKER_00]: will begin to degrade it won't be as
potent it won't work as well on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for reversal so it stores better
non-mixed don't mix the two containers
[SPEAKER_00]: together or if you can just keep the
concentrate stored together that works
[SPEAKER_00]: well also every time you start adding more
together it seems to degrade more quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you can keep the two jars separate
that's your best bet you can mix them and
[SPEAKER_00]: have one jar that's a good bet once you've
gone to diluting it for spray that is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you start degrading the product more
rapidly store it in a cool dry dark place
[SPEAKER_00]: I put mine and it's in the glass jars I
put those glass jars in a brown paper bag
[SPEAKER_00]: I label them so everybody knows what it is
and I stick that in the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator it's cold it's dark it's dry
they are sealed up nothing's gonna get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there make sure nobody drinks your silver
thiosulfate solution if you live with
[SPEAKER_00]: other people especially children do
everything you need to do to protect your
[SPEAKER_00]: household from contaminating themselves by
drinking silver thiosulfate I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what will happen to a person if they drink
that I don't want to find out I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: silver is not good for you in large doses
some people say to use colloidal silver
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way off track here anyway make sure
you protect yourself and your family so
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody consumes your silver thiosulfate a
mix or B mix or the combined solution
[SPEAKER_00]: light does degrade the quality of your
silver thiosulfate solution if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: it diluted non diluted mixed however
you've got it keep it dark because the
[SPEAKER_00]: light will cause the product to degrade it
will not be as good of a product also wear
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves and long sleeves when you're
spraying this also maybe put down some
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper underneath the plant when you're
gonna spray if you've got a strong non
[SPEAKER_00]: diluted mix sometimes it will turn white
walls will turn a little bit purple your
[SPEAKER_00]: skin will get some weird dots on it you
can contaminate things with the silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate so that is my update I wanted
to come in and say dark colored materials
[SPEAKER_00]: are bad dark water is bad always use glass
containers always use something non porous
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean for stirring I recommend highly
recommend using distilled water store them
[SPEAKER_00]: separately if possible if you've already
mixed it that's okay it will still store
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff is so cheap that you can just
make a bunch more don't even worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really affordable get the products
use the distilled water store it on non
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute if you can if you've already mixed
it together that's fine keep it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge keep it nice and cool and always do
your best to keep it dark and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly label the shit out of it
little kids can't read so even if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: write silver thiosulfate don't drink this
the little kids may still get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge one day they may drink it do
everything you can to prevent that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: your responsibility be a responsible adult
responsible grower responsible parent
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible human being let's not damage
injure make anybody sick while we're
[SPEAKER_00]: attempting to grow good cannabis medicine
all right that is my update on that part
[SPEAKER_00]: now it is time to jump into the email
portion of today's episode the first email
[SPEAKER_00]: on my screen comes from green vet eight
eight two two four shout out to green vet
[SPEAKER_00]: eight eight two two four this one came
from patreon and the question goes just
[SPEAKER_00]: like this it says I thought of a question
I've read online that softened water is
[SPEAKER_00]: unhealthy for our plants cannabis plants
included yes that is absolutely true it
[SPEAKER_00]: says is this true even when using liquid
nutrients yes sir that is true it says I
[SPEAKER_00]: use ro water I buy the water but the water
at my gross site is softened with a ppm
[SPEAKER_00]: reading of 185 is the issue that the water
is softened with salt thanks I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast from and they signed it with a
real name I don't know if they want their
[SPEAKER_00]: real name right on the air you know who
you are thank you for the great message
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course thank you for your service
and for the patreon support this one goes
[SPEAKER_00]: and I said service because they call
themselves green vet eight eight two two
[SPEAKER_00]: four I hope you're a veteran either way
you are a ganja veteran or a military
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran thank you for that service they're
asking about water softener a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people get water from a well or they've
got to use a water softener it says I use
[SPEAKER_00]: our water but the water at my gross site
is softened with a ppm of 185 water
[SPEAKER_00]: softeners are water is softened by
softened I said that really oddly but
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting it water is softened by
using salts they actually use sodium and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium to soften the water and at the
same time it removes the calcium and the
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium so that is not good for our
plants because that sodium is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: like drinking salt water so it makes our
plants think that they are in a drought
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting water but they're not
getting hydrated they keep drinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: water they're not hydrating themselves
they're saying hey I'm thirsty I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting hydrated but they're just sucking
down salt water and getting saltier and
[SPEAKER_00]: saltier and over time that will dehydrate
and destroy our plants the sodium will dry
[SPEAKER_00]: out the plants it's a lot like being in
the ocean and dying of thirst there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh water there you've got to clean up
that water all that salt water is not good
[SPEAKER_00]: for you your body can't process it it's
not hydrating you in any way it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: salting you up so yes the softened water
is unhealthy for your plants it says that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got RO water I would stick with the
RO water is what I would do it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more challenging it needs to be
buffered it's harder to keep the pH but it
[SPEAKER_00]: is not salty as shit and it's not going to
kill your plants so the question is is
[SPEAKER_00]: this true even when using liquid nutrients
absolutely this is true even when using
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid nutrients be careful with that
softened water because I don't want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydrate your plants make them all salty
we're trying to grow fine-grade cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: not salty hemp trees all right thank you
for the great question I'm gonna keep
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward because I feel like I've
got a good flow this one came from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend what's the name they want me to
call him I'm just gonna call you Xavier
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up bro I hope you're doing well the
message says my man Rasta Jeff happy new
[SPEAKER_00]: year bro happy new year to you as well it
goes on to say I hope the start of your
[SPEAKER_00]: year is going excellent my year has been
great I'm really excited to move on from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 and see what we can do with 2021
we've got a bunch of fresh new starts and
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly I am excited about it all right
it says unfortunately I'm starting my new
[SPEAKER_00]: year with sick plants that's okay it says
I'm embarrassed to admit it don't ever be
[SPEAKER_00]: embarrassed to admit that you've got sick
plants things go wrong in nature things
[SPEAKER_00]: happen especially in the garden especially
when you're learning admitting it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge step so you've admitted you got a
problem now we can work on solving it it
[SPEAKER_00]: says my once beautiful morning dew plants
in seedlings have started showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: ugliest downward clawing and they are so
droopy so they are downward clawing and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're super droopy I can think of a lot
of things that will cause that we will
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow it down it says even the veins of
the leaves look very pronounced and
[SPEAKER_00]: swollen all right that's giving me a
couple more ideas I feel like I've over
[SPEAKER_00]: watered in this case I'm not sure I'm
going to say you've over watered if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: clawing it's a little bit too watered if
it's droopy and it's been watered it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably over watered that thick vein you
see is a little bit of osmotic pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly there's just too much moisture
that leaf is trying to move that water
[SPEAKER_00]: around has nowhere to go it can't let the
air I can't let the water out through the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf that quickly the plants are
struggling it said I feed once a week
[SPEAKER_00]: every Friday I don't feed as much because
it seems like this peat-based soil I use
[SPEAKER_00]: takes forever to dry well you just got to
adjust to the drying time of that plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets bigger your plants are small now
I've seen the pictures as they get bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: that dry time will decrease they'll dry up
more quickly because the plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: eating more the roots will be larger
there'll be more processing happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: your rhizosphere so your watering time
will increase but now I am certain of it
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're over watering and watering too
frequently you've got to let them dry out
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more than what you've been
doing before you water the next time don't
[SPEAKER_00]: be so eager I don't think they've got to
be thirsty they got to be hungry because
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll let you know when they're hungry
and thirsty they're letting you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been over watering them by giving
you the claw the thick vein and the
[SPEAKER_00]: droopiness it says my plants are all
between five and nine inches tall my two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are in two of my plants are in one
gallon pots and the others are in six
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon or six solo cups so yeah I'm going
to assume that you're over watering these
[SPEAKER_00]: small plants because they're brand new and
you're eager to get nutrients to them you
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to feed them and get them bigger
I'm going to assume that you're over
[SPEAKER_00]: watering it also says I grow under LED
blurple lighting my last feed was at 600
[SPEAKER_00]: ppms I use advanced nutrients and recharge
that all sounds like it's going to work my
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is between 50 and 60 percent
that's good for now it may need to go down
[SPEAKER_00]: soon it says my daytime temp is about 78
to 81 that's going to work for you my
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime temp is 68 to 73 that's not too
bad as long as you're not getting too much
[SPEAKER_00]: of a swing in your nighttime to daytime
temperature it said how do I get my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: back to normal okay I looked at some
pictures here there were pictures included
[SPEAKER_00]: in this the pots you are using are simply
too large you've got small plants you said
[SPEAKER_00]: that some are in solo cups the plants that
are in the one gallon pots those should
[SPEAKER_00]: still be in solo cups those plants weren't
ready to be transplanted you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny root zone and a big container
and you're just watering that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: container and that little root zone is
saying that's a lot of water I didn't need
[SPEAKER_00]: all that so your first thing is that the
pots are too big the second thing is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are too wet when I looked at your
photos I didn't see anything in there for
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage I don't see enough perlite I
don't see any persolite but I do see some
[SPEAKER_00]: weird rocks on the top of the plants I
asked about the rocks you said you were
[SPEAKER_00]: using those to support the plant I would
get rid of those rocks immediately I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're when you're watering
those rocks have minerals they're dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: they got salts on them you're watering
something from those rocks into your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's highly unnecessary I would pull the
rocks out and I would put a stick in there
[SPEAKER_00]: to support that plant that will help you
out also I can tell by looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and I will include a photo here
for the audience that is watching visually
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drop in a photo right about now so
you guys can see what I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: but those plants have been overfed they
are too small for the amount of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to give them so they need
some time to dry and they don't need as
[SPEAKER_00]: much food I would let them dry give them
more time between feedings more dry time
[SPEAKER_00]: between feedings I would reduce the amount
of nitrogen and I would definitely remove
[SPEAKER_00]: those rocks from the grow those are a few
things that should get your plants back on
[SPEAKER_00]: track and I was fortunate enough to be
back in contact with our friend Xavier he
[SPEAKER_00]: followed our advice and guess what you
guys his plants look amazing now he's no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer embarrassed he's got a healthy crop
back on track to get 2021 under control so
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the great message Xavier I'm
glad I was able to help you out I hope I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to drop that photo here in the video
you guys comment let me know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think of the photo and if you've got any
questions about your grow please include
[SPEAKER_00]: some photos because that really did help
me out all right Xavier I hope we answered
[SPEAKER_00]: your question I'm excited to see your
garden back in track I'm gonna clear my
[SPEAKER_00]: throat and we're gonna move on to the next
message all right this next message came
[SPEAKER_00]: from the website there is a help tab on
the website simply go to I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: comm you will find the grow help tab on
that tab I do ask one two three four five
[SPEAKER_00]: six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen I ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you sixteen basic questions before you're
able to ask ask the real question I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to know what strain you're growing where
you're growing it what kind of lights
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using and then ask a few details of
your grow then I let you ask me a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question here is the grow help tab that
came from our friend do they want their
[SPEAKER_00]: name used yes this is from Robert and it
says they're growing wedding cake they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it indoors they're growing under
an HPS light they're in flower they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: week seven they're growing in cocoa the
last feed was water enzymes and shine
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like a great feed the pH was 6.0 I
would raise that up just a little bit the
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM or EC was 300 the daytime temp is 76
nighttime temp is 64 I would warm it up
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit it says nighttime
relative humidity is 55 on daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity is 55 nighttime humidity
55 it says the problem is my air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner took a crash that is always a
bummer when the air conditioner takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: crap you got to scramble and get a new one
it says I cannot get it fixed for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days due to the holiday and COVID seasons
I understand that completely it says my
[SPEAKER_00]: question is is 75 to 77 degrees daytime
temps and 65 degree nighttime temps and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and humidity around 55 gonna hurt
the grow if those conditions stay for five
[SPEAKER_00]: to seven days then back to normal which
would be around 73 at night and 65 or 73
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day and 65 at night with 40%
relative humidity I don't think your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to see any problem with
75 to 77 degrees I think they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy that I think you could run that
temperature all the time and they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: just fine I like 77 degrees in the grow
room 77 is really nice the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable I am comfortable however in a
commercial environment I've seen that they
[SPEAKER_00]: get up to about 81 and they seem to
perform a little more quickly sometimes so
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to see any
problems with the temperature excuse me
[SPEAKER_00]: for the throat clearing I do think that
maybe your humidity may be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: high so while you are down with your air
conditioner and you're getting the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity maybe consider adding another fan
or two maybe consider watering just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit less or less frequently just to
keep that a humidity down a little bit if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't put as much water in the room
that much water cannot get into the air so
[SPEAKER_00]: that is something I would consider maybe
water just a little bit less but overall I
[SPEAKER_00]: see zero problems rising from this couple
of degrees difference I actually think
[SPEAKER_00]: that they may benefit from it pay
attention to them and see if you like this
[SPEAKER_00]: lower temperature compared to your usual
higher temperature this may be something
[SPEAKER_00]: you adjust to and you can save a few bucks
or you may like the higher temperature not
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower temperature I apologize that's
rarely the case they may want to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit warmer like you're getting them
so pay attention and see how they react to
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher temps it will only be a couple
of days maybe a week or so but you may
[SPEAKER_00]: notice they grow a little bit more quickly
you get more vigor out of them with that
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer temperature although you are
fighting that higher humidity I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're gonna do with that but it
won't be too long you're not gonna get bud
[SPEAKER_00]: mold or anything like that that at that
point in flower with that much humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: any higher humidity I would be concerned
but pay attention don't let it get too
[SPEAKER_00]: high all right I feel like I've answered
that question more than thoroughly let's
[SPEAKER_00]: send a big thank you shout out to our
friend Robert for the great message if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got any more questions I would love
to hear from you all right let's move into
[SPEAKER_00]: the last message on today's episode this
one actually came from YouTube and it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from our friend fresh baked and it says
hey Rasta Jeff I thought let's see I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought age had to do a little bit with
pre flowers from my experience topping
[SPEAKER_00]: early has seemed to make them flower later
have you seen this as well I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about root bound being the trigger
and it makes sense I usually hesitate to
[SPEAKER_00]: up pop from one gallons until I see them
all right so the question here is about
[SPEAKER_00]: pre flower our friend is saying that they
topped their plants and they are wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: if topping the plants will create pre
flower will cause pre flower to appear
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the cycle I've got a good answer
for this the short answer is yes topping
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants can encourage your plants to
pre flower a little bit later and let me
[SPEAKER_00]: explain why cannabis plants are apical
dominant meaning they want one top bud
[SPEAKER_00]: they want one piece to grow up to the top
that one bud its goal is to reach up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top and get pollinated usually male
plants grow taller than the females the
[SPEAKER_00]: boys will be up above the girls the male
plant will be just a few inches maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: foot higher depending on your environment
and genetics when pollen starts to fall it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down so that female plant that's
right below it right next to it that top
[SPEAKER_00]: apical dominant bud is going to get
pollinated so it's got one bud always
[SPEAKER_00]: competing to be up at the top it wants to
make that one big giant it's a big sex
[SPEAKER_00]: organ it's looking to get that one big sex
organ pollinated it's like here I am coat
[SPEAKER_00]: me in pollen so I can make seeds and I can
continue my future I can continue for more
[SPEAKER_00]: generations so that plant wants to
naturally make an apical dominant top when
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut out that top what happens the
hormones that are in that top are no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer there and the plant goes hey I'm
not ready for puberty you just took off my
[SPEAKER_00]: parts that were growing that were older
they were ready to go into puberty I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a little teenager again and I
don't have any of my pre flower my
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity my puberty parts so you just
remove the apical dominant top from that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant you took out a lot of auxins and
cytokinins the hormones have been moved
[SPEAKER_00]: around in that plant all of those branches
that are down lower that are left they go
[SPEAKER_00]: hey the president is gone there's a chance
for me to be the president now and they
[SPEAKER_00]: all start trying to work their way up to
the top they want to be the new king they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be the new president they want to
be the new leader they don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are seven eight other branches nine
other branches trying to get up there to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top to be the leader as well so they
all start taking off those new branches
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the hormones that that old
branch had you cut those developed those
[SPEAKER_00]: built-up hormones right out of the plant
now the plant thinks it's a youngster
[SPEAKER_00]: again and it's going I'm not ready for
puberty it's gonna grow a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer until it can move those hormones
around once the auxins have developed and
[SPEAKER_00]: moved around again it'll say well now it
might be time to start spitting out some
[SPEAKER_00]: pre flowers now is the time to flower also
you did mention that being root bound will
[SPEAKER_00]: help with that yes if you don't transplant
them soon enough they will still show
[SPEAKER_00]: their pre flower but if you have them in
ideal conditions with a big enough pot
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not getting root bound you top
them they won't show pre flower as early
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have removed those hormones
from that apical dominant top and now all
[SPEAKER_00]: your lowers are competing to be the new
top and those hormones simply are not
[SPEAKER_00]: there they are in competition they're
young they're fucking rampant they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get up there and be the new lion
king the new president the new head of the
[SPEAKER_00]: table the new top bud so that is exactly
why in my opinion from my experience you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see pre flower as early when you top
your plants all right that was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: question thank you for that one if you've
got any more questions corrections
