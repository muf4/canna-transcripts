[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 352 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by keeping you updated on what I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm taking dabs of Durban Kush sauce
from Contraband Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is labeled as Durban poison and I-95
cross to pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a blend or if
that's actually a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is labeled as sweet and sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cut above bread, selected and
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you that mind eraser sort
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go blank for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got Mike ridiculously high earlier
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lab test printed on the
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says THCA 902.9 milligrams,
which equals 90.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC is 21.43 milligrams, which equals
2.1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are no other cannabinoids
detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban Kush sauce from Contraband
Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this energetic, talkative
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will be the second in a
series of grow lessons that will take us
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning of a grow all the way
up to harvest and drying and curing our
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we talked a little
bit about planning our grow and setting
[SPEAKER_00]: goals and finding ways to stay out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus more
on planning the specific grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of details written down for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm going to take a bunch more
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come back, we'll take a deep
dive into selecting and planning your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back and I
am ready to talk about selecting your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up a grow almost anywhere if
you can supply electricity, airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and water to that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you choose to grow is going to
determine a lot of your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a small closet, you'll be
very limited, but you'll still be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a usable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a prohibition state,
you'll need to take extra precautions to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the aroma down, and also you'll need
an excuse for the extra electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make a quick disclaimer that I
cannot endorse, encourage, or promote you
[SPEAKER_00]: to conduct any sort of illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to follow the laws and obey all
of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't listen to the last episode,
please go back and listen to that long,
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate rant I gave about what will
happen to you if you were suspected of
[SPEAKER_00]: having an illegal grow in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend everyone do your best to
minimize odor and obvious signs of a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in legal environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thieves know how to spot a grow and you're
entering a gray area that until recently
[SPEAKER_00]: has been run by criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're planning to produce a high value
product and people want that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell somebody about that product,
you are asking for trouble, so be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I talked about not
bragging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself protected by keeping your
mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about places to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow in closets, we can grow in
pre-made tents, we can grow in bedrooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can set up giant areas and basements,
and we can even use tiny spaces like our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends love for the plant and love for
the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in little micro grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of your space and the
pre-existing structure will dictate most
[SPEAKER_00]: of your setup, especially in a rental home
and even more so in a prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own your home or if you're busting
out the barn or if you're building out a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse in a legal area, you have much
more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal spaces for a grow are generally
places with low traffic and something you
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep hidden from visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like basements for home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attics are okay, but they're harder to
keep the climate dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is beating right on top of your
grow space and the home heat rises,
[SPEAKER_00]: so attics are generally warmer places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe my East Coast friends would have
better luck in the attic, while the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado crew will get down in the
basement better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basements are usually insulated by the
earth, so the temperature stays fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can isolate a small section or a
room in the basement, that is usually my
[SPEAKER_00]: first choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: People won't be down in your basement
unless you invite them, so it's easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the only issue with basements is when
you have to have a contractor come fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: water heater or the heater or some sort of
plumbing, you may need to be prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basements and attics are ideal in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spare bedrooms are great if you have good
control of your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live with other people,
you have to make sure that everyone is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same page with the importance of
security and light control in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live with other people and you've
got a grow room and a spare bedroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a good chance that when you're
gone, when you're on a date, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asleep, they're going to take somebody in
there and show off your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to do something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn on the light during
the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to leave the overhead light
on and not think about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal room light, when the grow
lights go off, that normal light will stay
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have everybody in the house on the same
page if you set up a grow in a shared
[SPEAKER_00]: home, in a shared room with other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is keeping
children out of the grow without
[SPEAKER_00]: supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let your kids help, that's up to
you as a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're growing for the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're growing for a child,
it's great to have that child go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and help with their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can build a relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you as a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You parent the way you feel you should do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep the grow room locked and keep the
kids out without supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd recommend a lock anyway, just to make
law enforcement happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone does come to inspect your legal
grow, a lock just makes you look like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to be more responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy step to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garages and outbuildings are also great
places for grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any space in which you can control the
lights, the temperature and humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can turn into a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a large space and you can't
control the large area, you can buy a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent of almost any size and set that up in
a room to create a more controllable
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also set up multiple tents to have
multiple cycles in the same basement or
[SPEAKER_00]: room area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a veg area and two tents with
alternating flower cycles to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of a basement grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about maximization once you get
your rooms dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can maximize a closet or a cabinet or
a warehouse if you set it up correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to keep safety and security in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your new grow option safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, can you handle the
consequences if you get yourself into
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump in, no matter where you set
up your grow, there are a few things to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I feel is most commonly
overlooked is the importance of airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: and air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to exchange the air in a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I stuck you in a closet for 24
hours and I didn't open the door for any
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air or to let out any of the gases
that came from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be alive and you'd be a little
uncomfortable and the air in that room
[SPEAKER_00]: would be so stale and funky that you just
couldn't wait to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be ready for some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants uptake CO2 and release oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to think about where we are
getting fresh CO2 from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the plants function, they release
water vapor that increases the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity of our grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have a plan to get rid of
that excess humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we remove the old air,
we need to replace it with fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most small grows, you'll be able to
replace the air probably with just the
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow that flows from underneath the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a closet grow or a very
small bedroom grow, you'll get enough air
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in through passive vents like
underneath the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your grow tents will have passive
vents built into the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilize those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a powerful enough blower
to extract the warm human air from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of a grow space, you may need to add a
passive intake to allow enough fresh air
[SPEAKER_00]: to flow into your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major consideration is airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get air in and out of your grow
space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't plan on leaving the door open
as part of your plan, because what about
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't leave the door open during the
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, what about those days when
you're not home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what about that night when you get too
stoned and fall asleep and forget?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on just leaving the door open
as part of your HVAC plan that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work, that is not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success, give your
garden a chance, and it will be so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it stressful, make it something
you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting off with a shitty plan like
trying to remember to close the door every
[SPEAKER_00]: night at 930, that's going to frustrate
you in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've stressed the importance
of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward and talk about
electricity and power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you safely provide electricity to your
grow area without causing a fire hazard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that guy that burned down your
house with a poorly designed grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the whole grow movement look
bad and sets us all back five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you power a grow light, a fan,
an exhaust fan, maybe an air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatever else you need for the grow
space you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull too many amps from one breaker
for too long because eventually something
[SPEAKER_00]: will melt and you will have a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flip a breaker more than two times
a day, it is time to reconsider your
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, be prepared to pay for your
electrical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have a crop for a few months,
but you're going to have lights to pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the first month,
so be prepared for that bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something a lot of young and new
growers forget to plan ahead for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hang up your grow light, you plug it
in, you get shit running, you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, in like 90 to 120 days I'm going to
harvest and have a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in about 35 days the bill comes
and you go, oh shit, I got to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred extra dollars because I'm running
this grow light and I didn't consider
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bill coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every month now you've got a new bill to
pay for that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're going to pull a lot of
extra electricity, have a plan to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: electric company why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need an excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they say, sometimes they send a
letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they show up and walk around the
house to check for inefficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, law enforcement can use your
electric bill as probable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the new smart meters, they can
probably tell exactly how many kilowatts
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using at exactly which point of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can probably tell that at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: you start pulling 4,000 watts worth of
extra power until 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it turns off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably know when you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably know when you're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that sort of stuff in mind when
you're building and designing your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and also when you're selecting your lights
and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about choosing lighting in
a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing we should consider is
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get water to your grow area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your grow space in the attic?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get water to your
attic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to fill up five gallon water
bottles and hook them up that ladder or
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to run a hose up there and
hope you don't have a catastrophe with
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if your grow is in the basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a tap down there in the basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have access to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where your water is coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, think about runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to dispose of water
occasionally, especially if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: a hydro system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your basement have a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a floor drain, give it a test
before you go pour in a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: water down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour a half a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't clog up, pour a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient because sometimes those floor
drains, they're backed up way down the
[SPEAKER_00]: line and you got to pour a bunch of water
in there and then suddenly it overflows
[SPEAKER_00]: into your floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you're going to pour a big
reservoir down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you're going to drain your
hydro gear down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test that floor drain before you rely on
it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also need to think about extra
water consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how big your grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much they're paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on if you pay the water bill or
if the landlord pays the water bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just may be something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about water,
I'm going to mention get a good shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have to get water to
your grow on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use about five gallons of water per
light, per day, maybe every other day when
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how much water you're going to
need while you're planning your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really think you want to huck a
five gallon container of water up that
[SPEAKER_00]: attic ladder for nine weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a medical marijuana patient
now, you will be by the end of that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we really need to think
about when planning our grow space is
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness and light control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you make your space completely dark
during your dark cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean dark to where it's kind of
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean dark where there's a little
bit of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean dark to where it is scary dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean zero light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lay in your grow space for five or 10
minutes with your eyes open and let your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes adjust to that total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then wave your hand in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand at all,
it is too light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need absolute total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any light will potentially cause your
plants to have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants have light during their
supposed night cycle, they might not even
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think you're in flower and you're
still vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be getting just enough light to
where they're kind of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're still kind of vegging and
they're looking really weird and they
[SPEAKER_00]: start taking on weird shapes and their
leaves get strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got a very small light leak,
the area that is getting hit by that light
[SPEAKER_00]: will make hermaphrodite flowers and that
will pollinate little sections of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll have little seeds in your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need an area that we can keep
absolutely dark during our dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that won't get interrupted by
somebody needing to use the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that won't get interrupted by
somebody needing to do laundry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that won't get interrupted by
somebody going out to the garage to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think ahead of all of the reasons somebody
may need to go in your grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like a little grow tent or an
isolated room or the back corner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement where nobody ever goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the major things to think
about when building your grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want somewhere discreet and secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to control temperature
and humidity within a very tight range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get about 77 degrees with about
40% humidity in our flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need somewhere with adequate power and
available water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also may need an excuse for the extra
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very important factor we keep
talking about is light control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have light interruptions in our
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep our light scheduled
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark cycle is super critical during
flowering, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be interrupted by the tiniest
amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, grow tents work great
because somebody can't walk into the room
[SPEAKER_00]: and flip on the switch for the light
that's in the room and accidentally get
[SPEAKER_00]: light in that grow tent if you've got it
closed up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave it open for airflow like I
talked about leaving the grow room door
[SPEAKER_00]: open earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave your grow tent open and get
too stoned or get way too into a game of
[SPEAKER_00]: fork knife and totally forget that those
lights went off at 7 and you left that
[SPEAKER_00]: room open and now it's 830 and you're
freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that shit happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you close the grow tent,
you should be safe from light
[SPEAKER_00]: interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered a lot of the basics
of selecting your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your needs and your goals and
try to find a space that works the best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you can provide the essentials,
you can make any space work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in that little mini closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath the stairs in an apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in a sketchy attic in a garage
in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in a spare bedroom in Bessemer
and I've busted out basements with
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between 2 and 12 lights
depending on the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also grown in giant warehouses and
I've done a lot of growing in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The needs are the same in all of those
spaces and a little planning and thought
[SPEAKER_00]: can make your tiny space produce the same
quality as commercial grows if done
[SPEAKER_00]: wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody talk down to you for
growing in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set your finished product next to their
finished product and ask them if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in a big room, in a warehouse or in
a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter as long as you are
producing a product that makes you happy
[SPEAKER_00]: and meets your demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody talk shit to you about
the way you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said last time, you're only doing
it wrong if the plants die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I want to mention is
cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set up in a basement or a spare
room, try to get anything not grow related
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a solid cleaning of any
space before setting up and if the space
[SPEAKER_00]: has a funky dingy smell, like if you're in
a basement and it's got that basement
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, try to find the cause of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's down there making it funky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe get a bunch of fresh air
through that space for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: before you set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe open some windows, get some fans
going, spray some osium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to get rid of that funky smell
because that smell could stick to your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to grow in a funky space
and then you don't want your product to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up smelling like funky basement and it
will if your space has that funk,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're going to dry and cure
in a funky basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to get rid of that funky basement
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that just by getting air into
the room, get a little airflow going,
[SPEAKER_00]: get that old funky air out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said to clean the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in a room is a spot for a
spider mite or a pest to hang out and
[SPEAKER_00]: hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every little spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some clothes in there,
that's a beautiful spot for a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs just to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to clean up the space and have a
nice tidy grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help you keep everything organized
and it will help you keep bugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find a good space, make sure it's safe,
make sure you can get a lot of airflow to
[SPEAKER_00]: the area, make sure you can get water to
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to provide supplemental
CO2 to your grow space, make sure you can
[SPEAKER_00]: carry CO2 tanks to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tanks are heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you can control the lights
in your grow space and also the darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow space and be sure that you
can control the flow of human traffic in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you don't want your pets down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not encourage people taking their
animals to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want your pet in the grow,
that's on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go play in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're picking up pests probably from
every plant in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing it right into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't encourage that, but you do what
makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you're only doing it wrong
when the plants die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is to make sure this is
something you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will talk about selecting
specific equipment for your specific grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next episode.
