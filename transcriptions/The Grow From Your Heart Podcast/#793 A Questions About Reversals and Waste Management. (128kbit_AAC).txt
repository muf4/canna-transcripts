[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 793 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to give away a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've teamed up with our friends at seeds
here now.com to give away a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out, we'll talk more about that later
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that iry genetics
will be at the dude groves cup this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, we are participating in the
dude grows cup, June 3rd in Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out dude grows.com or
DGC cup.com for all of the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you check out iry direct
for a new restock and reduced pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all of the advertising and
business to cover here at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, iry genetics.com,
there's a tab on the top right that says
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab, we will ask you
a few questions about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you growing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it indoors, outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are your temps and humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you feed the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we give you plenty of opportunity to
explain the problem in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do invite you to send those questions to
the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from our friend Brad in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Brad in Canada
for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hello Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read this on the podcast,
you can call me Brad from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listened to every episode that's
available on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has quickly become my favorite growing
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that you are listening on
Spotify, but I do highly recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: you check out the YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single episode is available on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me say that over because not
every single episode is on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube has taken some down, but there are
a lot more episodes available on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: than there are Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably 785 episodes on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotify only gives us the most 100 recent,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot more content on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, come check out the 4K video and see
my smile and face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that you're listening on
Spotify, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do invite you to check out the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said I'm becoming my favorite growing
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your deep dives and out of the box
creative thinking such as 18 six for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 10 days of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says or 18 six for bigger, stronger,
faster finishing seeds is truly one of a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only learn here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a lot of controversy,
a lot of feedback, a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: flack, I guess, for teaching people to run
their plants on 18 six at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have sent negative
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people that tell me I'm a
lunatic, the only people that tell me it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad idea are people who haven't tried
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that try to run their plants 18 six
for the last 10 to 14 days of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always come back and they say,
dude, my plants were better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were beefier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were chunkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finished a little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that make seeds under the 18 six
schedule at the end, they always tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: they have great success with the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing the 18 six idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for trying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that worked out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says anyhow, on today's podcast,
you mentioned watching out for expired
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and how they can negatively
affect your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you could go over how to
properly dispose of your grows waste
[SPEAKER_00]: products such as bottles of fertilizer,
runoff, pesticides, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all you do, Brad,
from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I feel is very
overlooked in the commercial and private
[SPEAKER_00]: production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trained by the Colorado Department of
Agriculture to understand pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: handling, pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand mixing nutrients safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand applying nutrients safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the state of Colorado for the
marijuana enforcement division and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Department of Agriculture and
Public Health and Environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are two different entities,
I kind of combined them, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: technically no protocol for disposing of
wastewater, excess nutrients, excess
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no true protocol for that in a
commercial cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main concern is the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really try when we are creating
a batch of pesticides to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to make too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have almost too little or just
barely enough to coat the room to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to figure out what to do
with the leftover pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, we just spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep spraying until you run out
because that's your best option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply it to the plants, apply it to the
walls if you need to, hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to waste it by pouring it into
the water supply or into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticides, my main mission is to just
mix up just enough and coat the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several applications, I've been
applying in several locations for so long
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically we know exactly how much to
mix up per room.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that room, I need seven gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that room, I'm just pointing at
arbitrary rooms that exist in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that one room takes about
seven gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That other room only needs about three and
a half gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my method there is strategy and
not mixing up too much to where I have any
[SPEAKER_00]: waste or leftovers, which sometimes I nail
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, sometimes we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do have to get creative with
the disposal of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Ag has taught us that
dilution is the solution to pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got to pour it somewhere,
mix it heavily with regular water and
[SPEAKER_00]: dispose of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not sound like the greatest
idea, but that's what I was instructed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Ag was to pour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It down the floor drain and dilute it with
regular water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about the nutrients,
waste nutrients in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not be uncommon for me to mix up
a 500 gallon reservoir of nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: then feed most of that to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most, most cases you hear me preach
about watering to runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, unfortunately, once again,
there is not a protocol with the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture, the Department
of Health OSHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's given us a true standard
operating procedure of how to dispose of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leftover nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I was going to say fortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, at one of the facilities
where I spent most of my time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility was out in what would be
considered a big field in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_00]: desert area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just a bunch of brush out
there, a bunch of sagebrush, a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cactus, a bunch of yucca, a bunch of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what was behind our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, if we had excess
water, we would pour that water into the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt and water those plants, which was
amazing because all of the vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: behind our facility was lush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gigantic year round everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would turn brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get dusty and crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our vegetation behind our facility around
our facility was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we got some giant rabbits and some
giant rattlesnakes and a bunch of giant
[SPEAKER_00]: life because I think we were feeding the
plants so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food was abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animals were abundant, which made the
rattlesnakes abundant, which made the
[SPEAKER_00]: birds abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of shit happening in our
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of it was because of the
nutrients, which we were dumping out there
[SPEAKER_00]: in that field and feeding all of those
weeds, all of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were giving them high quality grow
nutrients and boosting the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was how we were disposing of the
excess water, the nutrients, the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we were told that that
should go down the floor drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not agree with that, but I did not
know what else to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, there was not a strong
protocol by any of the governing bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of oversee the production of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were basically told that the standard
operating procedure and the thing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to pour it down the floor drain
or to continue putting it in the backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never felt good putting a pesticide in
a floor drain, but that's what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: instructed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they did not have any other
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just pour it down the floor drain and
pour a bunch of gallons of water on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we kind of dilute that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was a better answer to this,
honestly, because it doesn't feel good
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you that the protocol was to pour
shit in the backyard and pour it down a
[SPEAKER_00]: drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Colorado, there is no rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were never fined.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were never told to do any differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were never given any guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I said that's what we were doing,
the department of ag basically turned
[SPEAKER_00]: their head and said, I guess that's what
you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the best way to do it,
but that's the option that I was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically how we got rid of the
runoff fertilizers and the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did ask about a couple of other
products, bottles of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would basically use the fertilizer in a
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would use that to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would never be anything left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing would expire in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff comes and goes very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are disposing of a pesticide or a
nutrient bottle, the proper protocol is to
[SPEAKER_00]: poke a bunch of holes in that bottle near
the bottom around the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that nobody can reuse that container
and get themselves sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pesticide bottle, a nutrient bottle,
it's got to be punctured several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those punctured bottles would go
into a dumpster that had to be locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also into that dumpster would go all of
our root balls, a lot of our organic
[SPEAKER_00]: waste, a lot of the sticks, the stems,
a lot of the trim that we didn't use to
[SPEAKER_00]: send out to get extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any waste would go into a big dumpster,
old pots, old soil, just about all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste would get put into one dumpster that
was required to be locked and only the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility manager, which was myself most of
the time, and the person that picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: the trash had a key to that dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not believe how many times
people cut the lock off of our dumpster,
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to break into our dumpster,
destroyed our dumpster to get what they
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was product, but it was actually
nothing but sticks and dirt and waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you throw something away,
if there is plant material in your waste
[SPEAKER_00]: and you throw that away in Colorado,
it's got to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either got to be mixed with bleach or
they like it if you mix it with kitty
[SPEAKER_00]: litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times what I would do is when
we harvest it, I would save a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: pots behind three gallon pots filled with
cocoa so that way when it came time to
[SPEAKER_00]: blend in the waste from all the plants,
I could dump some of that cocoa on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, put some plants in there, dump cocoa
on top of it, put plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they wanted you to make a
lasagna of plant waste and then something
[SPEAKER_00]: to destroy the plant waste and then more
waste so that when the people do come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and break into the trash cans,
if they do get something, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really get a product they can make any
profit or any consumption off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying, they were trying,
but some of the MED rules were completely
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm thinking about it, I've got
footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably don't have the footage on my
phone anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for a facility that was kind of
tucked back off of the main street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any traffic that went by there was just
weirdo traffic looking for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would come by on bikes and
shine flashlights in our grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to build a 12 foot fence around the
facility and keep the trash can inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 foot fence and still walk the trash
cans because people are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, one night, a homeless person
climbed over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assumed they were homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd seen them around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never, they, they looked very,
maybe I'm prejudging, but this person that
[SPEAKER_00]: did not look like they'd had a shower in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part was quite obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They climbed our fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to get into the trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they shimmied up one of the rain
gutters and got to the roof of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building, jumped off the roof WWF style
and shoulder bombed their way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of our dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metal lid of the dumpster caved in a
bunch of dust came flying up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw them fall through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked disheveled for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got their shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked like they just won the
freaking lottery, but then when they threw
[SPEAKER_00]: the those bags over the fence,
they left them there because they realized
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't nothing but sticks and fucking
kitty litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person climbed up our rain gutter,
got all the way to the roof of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building and WWE or WWF style jumped off
the fucking building through our dumpster
[SPEAKER_00]: to attempt to steal our trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how ridiculous it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that went into that dumpster
had to be destroyed, punctured,
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed with kitty litter, ground to a pulp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the dumpster had to be locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was behind two gates in some
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trash was a very huge target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had my trash targeted like that
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me recap and make sure I've
answered all of the aspects of this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispose of the grow waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I considered grow waste products to be
plants, pots, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes into the locked dumpster bottles
of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use all of the liquid inside of those
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything gets used in a commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're mixing up 500 gallons of
nutrients, if you've just got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: extra just poured in, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't make a difference for one
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a little bit guys, don't go get
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the bottles get punctured runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we did not have any guidance or
expertise on what to do with the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pouring it in the field and feeding
the vegetation, the pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do our best, our absolute best to mix
up enough for this application so that
[SPEAKER_00]: none is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you need to overspray,
go spray some foliage outside something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that if you really have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that wraps up that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to send another big thank you
shout out to our friend Brad from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to Brad from Canada,
my dude, you have won yourself a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This free seed giveaway is sponsored by
our friends at seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out seeds here now.com
for regular feminized auto flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry all of your favorite breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they do have iry genetics in
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But congratulations, Brad from Canada,
you have won a free pack of iry genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I do live limit the seed
giveaways to the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I liked your question quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will eat the cost and ship that right
up there to Canada for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad, please do send me your shipping
address so I can get you a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said before that if I read your
question here on the podcast, you will win
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what kind of grow question do you
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Daniel said how viable is a breeding
project that is solely based on using
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from reversed females?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I want to get into breeding,
but my current circumstances greatly favor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing femme auto flowers over photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming I'm able to readily reverse
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there significant downsides compared
to using males?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the info that I'm going to give
you this next piece of info comes from my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Mr. Soul at Brothers Grim
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go support him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with 99% of what he says when it
comes to talking about cannabis and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else, which is very rare for me
to agree with somebody that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% is huge agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big fist bump to my buddy, Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul put it this way one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference between regular and
feminized seeds, the main difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference is the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female pollen is what is creating
female seeds on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically imagine this is not how it
works, but you can imagine it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I were able to create a filter
and put a filter in the air and that
[SPEAKER_00]: filter only removed male pollen from the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knew it was like female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go ahead and party.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ladies night, but male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're staying outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine I've got this filter and then I
make my plant produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we are doing is eliminating the male
pollen from the equation and that female
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen is hitting the plants and making
100% female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Mr. Soul put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me the analogy of using the filter
that is very much what it's like when
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with a reversed female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference that you're going,
okay, there may be another difference I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get into, but the only difference that
you're going to notice is that it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be all female seeds because there is no
male pollen in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we are reversing the female
plant because we're making female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female pollen is the key to all that
feminization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said there's one more thing you may
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you're going to notice is more
uniform phenotypes and less transgressive
[SPEAKER_00]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when we work with regular
seeds, when we make further filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generations, we will see expressions of
the grandparents and the grandma and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandpa and the great grandma and the
great grandpa on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the options of more things
popping up in your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the regular seeds,
using FEM seeds, I think we kind of cut
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get less phenotypical expression,
less variation and more uniformity in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with the plants that I have
selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you select different plants and go a
different route in your breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could vary just because of the plants
that were chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like over time, I've developed a
very discerning eye, a very keen eye for
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting breeding pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this far in my breeding game,
I really do see very nice phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the FEMs and less variation
than what I see coming from the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make plenty of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of feminized seeds and I make
a lot of regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a lot of them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My test team grows a lot of them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My testing is 100% true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a lot of people grow out the seeds
that make it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing less variation in the feminized
seeds than I am in the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's possibly an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the variation that is coming from
the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like doing reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like seeing how the male expresses,
how the female expresses, what the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take this male and pollinate four
different females, how does that express
[SPEAKER_00]: differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be clear what that reversed plant
is contributing to your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pollinate multiple females with
that plant and see what the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you'll be able to see, oh,
when I pollinated the strawberry plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with this blueberry plant, we got
strawberry blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I pollinated the orange plant
with the blueberry, the orange really
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I pollinated Durban poison with the
blueberry, the Durban poison really
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get to see what traits and what
dominates in what mix by breeding to other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but you won't see as much
variation as you would if you were running
[SPEAKER_00]: the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience in that test right there,
I do see more variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see more grandparents represented with
the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me recap the question, make sure
I'm giving you a solid answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How viable is breeding that solely uses
pollen from reversed females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is one of my most popular,
best-selling strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is definitely, orangegasm is my
number one selling seed line that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two crosses are 100% feminized and
they are very viable, very potent,
[SPEAKER_00]: very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey and orangegasm are probably,
those are my two most popular strains I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever made, and they're fems made from
reversed female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start a seed company that will
be very successful with fem seeds if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do it properly, if you take the proper
time for selection, if you make sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: test, test, test, test, I can't say that
enough, test, a lot of testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: test every female that you plan on putting
in your breeding project for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that a female plant could
represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out, first of all, does it
handle heat stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle cold stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle overfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle underfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle too much heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle too much cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle high humidity, low
humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle overwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have repeated a couple of those
things, but does it handle all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do these plants that you intend to breed
with, do they show any type of intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits when you beat them up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they handle light interruptions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they handle darkness interruptions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they handle problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they bug resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they pathogen resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they friendly to the grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that I really like to
think about when I'm making seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: will go to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these seeds going to be a complete
pain in the ass or will everyday consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to complete the grow with this
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about those traits when you are
making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the short answer is that your idea for
a breeding project of feminized only seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: could and will be very successful if the
selection is done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't select plants that have been
tested, tried and true, that's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: can run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put one plant into this breeding
program that is intersex, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring from that plant do hold the
potential to be intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's test the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's remove any intersex plants from the
gene pool before we do any breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is the number one complaint from
a consumer when it comes to buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those plants show nanners in week
three, people are going to be pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it shows nanners in week six,
they're going to be extra pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not release anything or breed to
anything that has the opposite opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: or shows the potential to display intersex
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, if you do the selection
properly, if you pay attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you stress test all of your plants
before you breed, pick your plants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick all of the plants you want to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a mother plant of all of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have two or three clones of each of those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put all the potential breeders in a
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put the light schedule on 12-12 and
leave it like that for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in a couple of days, I'm going to
fuck it all up and put it back on 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a few days later from that,
I'm going to overwash it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a couple of days after that,
we'll put it back on 12-12 and wait two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of those plants freak out,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that continue through and
flower and finish properly, those are my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run some testing, verify that you've
got good quality breeding candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you've verified that,
that's when you do your pollen chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that is only the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've done the pollen chuck,
and the next step is to grow out the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow populations as large of a population
as you can from each batch and take a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very observant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take ridiculous notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant does something, one weird
thing, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does some very small thing,
write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does something drastic, definitely
write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But grow out as many of those as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if the seeds you have produced,
like we started with, are they intersex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you meet your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a breeding goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants that you have created
better than both of the parent plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not quality seeds, I don't
recommend sharing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selling them or giving them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe use them for your own, or maybe turn
them into some sort of oil, or put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if you hit your goal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if they're quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if this is something that you
would be proud to share with the
[SPEAKER_00]: community, or if it's something you'd
rather flush and act like never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be ashamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not select the proper strains,
select again, get it going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you did mention that you want to use
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to do this with
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to find an auto
flower plant that looks like a good
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to reverse that,
then put that on several more females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly do not have experience breeding
with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selection process there would baffle
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know that that is a breeding male
if I haven't flowered it out and finished
[SPEAKER_00]: it and see what it looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't cut a clone and repeat the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to pick one that
looks real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse it right before flower,
right before it starts to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I don't mess with auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend spraying the plant for the
first reversal about 10 days, seven to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days before you put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to time that,
spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it goes into flower,
you've got to spray it every three days
[SPEAKER_00]: for about 21 to 24 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to time that to where the
females are ready for pollen at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a whole new set of
challenges that I don't even know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust for, because I'm not familiar with
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to seeing your breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do make seeds, if you do this,
send me an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how this goes, because I would
love to know how my guidance helped you
[SPEAKER_00]: and also maybe my guidance slowed you
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what I did wrong for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming I'm able, I'm able to readily
reverse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there significant downsides?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not find any downsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a great project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're onto the right start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very excited for you to be making
your own feminized auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
