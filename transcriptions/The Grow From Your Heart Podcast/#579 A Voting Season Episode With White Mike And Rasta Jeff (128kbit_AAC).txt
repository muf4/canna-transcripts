[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you sound great on the microphone
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hanging out before the show and
you've sounded wonderful so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay right where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand the mic everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're doing a really good job on
it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Mike, what are you smoking on today,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of deliciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our local dispensaries had some
fire golden goat flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been enjoying a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, uh, we were shopping together that
day, had them open the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, thanks to COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get your face in the jar
anymore, which is always a little iffy to
[SPEAKER_02]: me, but, uh, it was nice to get a good
whiff of what you were buying,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a good look at what you were buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, now they like stick it in the
butcher case in front of you and open it
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as they cracked the jar,
we can smell the goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It threw my mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wearing a mask and I could smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Ooh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it opened up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been enjoying it and it's got me in a
nice podcasting mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, uh, what have you been smoking on
lately, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me fix my mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just turned myself down too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for asking Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking halo live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is a blend of headbanger and
infinity OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the thing where I talk about what it
says on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it tastes like deconstructed sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the fuck deconstructed
sour diesel tastes like, but it is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee and gassy at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some earthy tones to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy it on the back of the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says 66.74% THC non-detectable amounts
of CBD, uh, halo live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, really nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, perfect chilled out mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that taste as great?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a funky, gassy, disgustingly
delicious aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are my favorites, those gross
and delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's in the cart that I'm,
if you see me hitting a cart this episode,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what's in the cart is some halo
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may need to grab myself a couple of pens
or a couple of fat joints for these
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes when we hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I need something to do with my
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do with my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I noticed that if I keep this on me,
I don't move around at the desk as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may need my sound management plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may need a pop prop and or pacifier for
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sound plan, but it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound great and you look great and
you're fucking stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, speaking of people who look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see anything, but people can see
me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put some lights in Mike's face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, people have been saying that he
looks like a talking head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we put a light in front of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what Mike looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his smiling face there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for joining me today,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and thanks for checking out my new
lighting situation in the room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, doing what I can with the,
with what I've got trying to move away
[SPEAKER_00]: from that old crowded dusty space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more improvements coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep teasing that you guys are going to
be as excited as I improvements coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike knows what's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, if you tell anyone, you know how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my improvements y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I tried to segue into it smoothly a
moment ago, but we didn't make it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the part of the show where
we're going to do shout outs to the
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the seven 10 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the seven 10 club are the folks
who support the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast on Patreon at the $7 and 10 cent a
month level or higher.

of his patrons and give some love.

[SPEAKER_02]: It, uh, it makes me feel, um, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our supporters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting choked up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that's the dab I took.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of that's the dab I just took.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, part of that's the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's growing every week and,
uh, yeah, guys, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike appreciates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we were joking before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I made a joke on another episode that
Mike spends the Patreon funding on his
[SPEAKER_00]: kids and he goes, buddy, you couldn't be
more right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids are getting spoiled because of
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the kids, I'm not going to say
their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep their names private on the
show, but those two little guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: sending you guys, uh, sticky fist pumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're wondering where I am,
it's, it's, uh, small children are
[SPEAKER_02]: exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he's not on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also why the world's closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we've got him hidden away in a
small dark space right now is that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: just sequestered from the family for a
moment so he can get some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not on video, this is sort of a
weird moment of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the background behind me is flat
black.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really just do look like a floating
head right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been called the floating head in
the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am learning more about video
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get Mike up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been using, uh, some of my Patreon
contributions for things to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I get my show where I want it,
we're going to get some of my Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions over toward Mike's area to
get his recording space looking as good as
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we owe it to the, to Mike and to the
audience here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mike, this is a good flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may turn into a long episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not intend for this long of a show,
but I think we took the appropriate dads
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, then we'll certainly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mike, is this the time of the show
where we segue into the email portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to jump right into that part?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we checked off all the, the
essentials, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did any ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the shout outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the intro song.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time to talk about the topic
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered all the important stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said thank you to the people that help
us make the show happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reminded them to buy some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say appetizers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appetizers are complete onto the meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought you said advertisers and I
was jokingly saying appetizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you did say appetizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said appetizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make me hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's focus in here just a little bit
because it's early to jump off the jumping
[SPEAKER_00]: board, uh, the diving board this early
into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got a great email in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want their name said it's just
letters and numbers anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to your podcast today and there
was a short portion on grow safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow the show a little while
back, I've done a, done a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes now on keeping yourself and your
gross safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you poking your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you burning down the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done what I can to update you on
ideas of how to keep your grow and your
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family and yourself safe while you were
growing in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need problems in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, this goes on and says,
you said something that I have often
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone shows up and there is some dink
in the air, how would I explain that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: away?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person lives apparently in
prohibition land and they want,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got a good excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody knocks on the door and they
say, Hey bro, we smell cannabis in your
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has a wonderful, in my
opinion, what could be a wonderful excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want some feedback from Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see if he thinks this would fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, my answer is to have a quarter or
two of hemp buds in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone comes over knocking on the door
about the odor and so inside or out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hand over the hemp buds and say,
sorry, sir, I ordered this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the packaging and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was under the impression that CBD hemp
was now okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might cost me 50 bucks, but I know
someone is paying attention and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep my ass out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like a good warning that somebody
knows you're smoking in there and you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust and adapt and maybe get rid of
some things and maybe stop doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, no one knocking on your door
would have any further reason to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: it was anything else unless you look like
a stoner high guilty, which would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing not to do in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very blessed and lucky to live here
in Colorado where I can have these
[SPEAKER_00]: dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, these dreads are tied up in a
nice big old bundle right now because they
[SPEAKER_00]: do get ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things go to my calf region and I am
sick and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are a little bit
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't look like this in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely what it is in Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made some jokes about Texas on a
previous show that I was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are great people down there in
Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laugh with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we can't look like this in
fucking a lot of places, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very blessed that we have legal
cannabis here and I think the police know
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys that look like you and I,
we're not the ones with the other drugs on
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the ones with the cannabis because
you can tell the crowds apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's no need to fuck with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that guy's a weed head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go mess with the other
heads because they're the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get the ones going through your
trash and fucking trying to break into
[SPEAKER_00]: your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, don't look like a stoner is rule
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, how do you feel about this approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were in, let's just pick a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you pick a state so nobody bashes
me for bashing a state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, that's my thought on it is that
it really, really, really, really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really depends on where you live.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of places have already preemptively
stepped on this excuse for why it smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like herb at your place and said that
smokeable hemp isn't allowed, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD or legal hemp sort of is allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's at least one state that's still
saying it doesn't matter what the feds say
[SPEAKER_02]: about industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say no, still.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of states who haven't
invested in the technology to definitively
[SPEAKER_02]: prove high THC, CBD, no THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to cut you off because you
just said something that I forgot what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to cut you off for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, some states we said, Colorado said,
hey, fed, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states have said, hey, fuck you with
your CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's opposition just so they can oppose
just like we approved the fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even realize that that was a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm ignorant and ignorance is
bliss.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if this ploy has any effect or a
positive effect really depends on where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're standing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of places it smells like herb here
is still probable cause for a search on
[SPEAKER_02]: its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you say it smells like this
because of this legal reason at the door,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to say it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still get to search and we're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still smells like cannabis and we need
to make sure it's not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In places like Colorado smell alone is no
longer probable cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like unless you're driving and it
smells like burnt joint, but it's your
[SPEAKER_02]: home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gross situation at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an interesting thing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to totally interrupt you and I
apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who was pulled over in the
great state here of Colorado and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: not even allegedly, he was straight up
smoking a blunt, enjoying his ass,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got pulled over and he said,
smoking a fucking blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and he took a couple of fat rips off
of it and put it in the ashtray and rolled
[SPEAKER_00]: down the window and said, what's up
officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cop said, Whoa, it smells like
weed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your hurry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy goes, I'm trying to go to a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually going to, he was meeting
me somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm going to a thing and trying
to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cop goes, yeah, we were driving a
little bit too fast to be smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to slow yourself down and
gave him a speeding ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy was like kind of freaking out
and he was all like paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cop was like, you can relax or we
know you're smoking in there, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't seem intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told him that consumption did not
constitute impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you seem fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're driving too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't swerving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to smoke a blunt while
you're driving and sent him on his way,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, it's up to the cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much they want to fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately right now, there's a lot
of stories where they choose to fuck with
[SPEAKER_02]: you extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also plenty of stories where they
choose to fuck with you less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, he's wildly,
we're going to the same place fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: very, we're headed the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you look like and where
you're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been fortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get away with stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why we nicknamed you
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I, I, I'm going to take the honor why
I nicknamed you white Mike, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: look like a white guy, just a basic
general white guy, not going to cause any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you guys just for an update,
I call him white Mike, because if I'm ever
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking two rules at a time, he will
remind me only break one law at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, Hey, you're smoking that
blunt and going fucking 90 pick one,
[SPEAKER_00]: either flick the blunt out the window or
go 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he'll remind me he's only smoking a
blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, he's my free legal guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my fucking best friends on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's good at fucking psychology and
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my white friend over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just get to say, you can't give
yourself a nickname.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a real nickname, you didn't have a
hand in crafting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, this, uh, I, I, I just
talked to somebody who was busted growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a, uh, an odor control failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a passerby alerted the authorities by
the time person got home from work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a, why the fuck you grilling all
this weed problem on their doorstep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they tried to say it was all
legal hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, luckily cops don't go to school for
lots of stuff and they, the school they go
[SPEAKER_02]: to isn't real long or detailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of officers have no fucking idea
what they're looking at or what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, which has led to a lot of
amusement on my part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably in the community's part,
when we see a bust and they're taking the
[SPEAKER_02]: news crew through the grow house and they
pointed a carbon filter and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a CO2 generator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, man, the only thing
that got right was the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've seen that video by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, in practical terms, um,
one of the things I told that person is if
[SPEAKER_02]: they took all the plant matter,
which they tend to do, they, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: they do exactly what you see them do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stuff all the plants in a bunch of
trash bags and then haul that to an
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence locker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who's grown anything knows that
when you do that to a living plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you've done is you've killed a
marijuana farm and you've started a mold
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time that product gets to a lab,
can they tell if it's THC or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're CBD product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the fuck knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think varies wildly from state to
state based on technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell that moldy fucking dead plant
in that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like lawn clippings plus puke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it doesn't take long to mold out
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a bunch of plants, stick them in
a plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stick that in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You come back a couple of days later,
you've got a big fucking bag of mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's the same thing with the hemp
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say, no, it smells like that
because it's hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky, they take the hemp flower
or take your word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not lucky, they send it off to
get tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come back an hour later with a
warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we actually got to be careful with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be careful with the claim that
it's hemp flower because now with the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: bill and a bunch of hemp acts,
you were required to have licensing and
[SPEAKER_00]: permits to grow, to commercially cultivate
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost safer to grow cannabis than
it is to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they come and you're growing
cannabis and they say, is this weed or
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say it's hemp, they're going to go
get the department of agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're supposed to have a fucking license
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still get as hefty of a fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to face the jail time,
but you'll get fined.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I mean, this takes me back to
one of the things I always recommend is
[SPEAKER_02]: really know the law in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because depending on where you're
standing in the U S you can have all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plants you want just at your
house, other places, you can only have a
[SPEAKER_02]: few other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants have to test a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and who's to say who gets to test what
there's at least one business fit going
[SPEAKER_02]: through all kinds of legal headaches right
now, because they bought a shitload of
[SPEAKER_02]: legal hemp seed on the open market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't the whole batch that they
got, but a chunk of their seed ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: being a high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they had this big field of hemp and
then one corner of it was a high THC
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're dealing with major headaches
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other places are dealing with the exact
same headaches because their shit tested
[SPEAKER_02]: at 1% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed sellers should potentially be held
responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew if they offered something that
wasn't as advertised, there should be some
[SPEAKER_00]: recourse to the seed sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold myself responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this was a federally legal business
operating with normal business practices,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that shit would just be in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's not because, well,
that's the second half of the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, do you want to work our way into
that Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seg way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to drop that clip in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used it yet, but we need it for
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's time to make a segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is the part where we're going to
let, uh, Mike work his way into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of politics because it is voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of critical stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a platform with an audience and I
feel it is almost my responsibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: educate and inform on other things than
just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think I can quit rambling and I can
let Mike start rambling a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I wrote down though,
bro was a political signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to tell us your story about
your political signs, and then we'll work
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the rest of your, your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with COVID and everybody just being at
home most of the time, um, like our worlds
[SPEAKER_02]: have kind of collapsed in on each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't know about y'all,
but one of the things I do to keep myself
[SPEAKER_02]: sane and keep the kids sane is we take
little walks around the neighborhood and
[SPEAKER_02]: not long walks just around the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one, one, one day we do the
right side of the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, we do the left side of the
block kind of loop around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we've watched the evolution of
the political signs going up and down our
[SPEAKER_02]: street and around our neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in this part of town, it's really
chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of signage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about maybe two months ago,
six weeks ago, one house on our street
[SPEAKER_02]: puts out, there was no Trump sign at
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started out with two local
conservatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so like, um, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: A Senator level and then a state rep level
sign in the front yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like two days later, there was a Trump
sign to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like he just didn't have the
Trump sign yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the only signs on our street
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, I live right across the
street from a military vet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, one day I come home and he's
definitely got where his American flag
[SPEAKER_02]: normally is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Trump flag, but it's a Trump
flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen before because it seems
like it's Trump on one side, American flag
[SPEAKER_02]: on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not great with flag etiquette,
but immediately my brain was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait, alarm bells.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should look at that more and figure
out what the hell you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the next two days, it goes from
Trump flag on one side, American flag on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other, to double-sided American flag,
to double-sided Trump flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me and the wife are talking about
this, just laughing, going, is it a
[SPEAKER_02]: husband and wife fighting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is it going up and coming down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the guy not sure about the support?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it turns out is it's just badly
hung up and it's a one-sided Trump flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, just terrible flag etiquette.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hung up, um, overlaid on his American
flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the American flag set up on the
front of his house and he's just clipped
[SPEAKER_02]: the Trump flag right next to it in the
same guide rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so depending on which way the wind's
flapping or if it's hanging still,
[SPEAKER_02]: it looks like six different flags at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point in the story,
there's the one house down the street with
[SPEAKER_02]: three little yard signs and the flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I go down the street and all of the
houses around the first house have Biden
[SPEAKER_02]: signs out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've surrounded the dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then two other people on the street put
out Biden flags or not Biden flags,
[SPEAKER_02]: Biden signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then next morning, all of the Biden signs
are gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody came through and stole them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two days later, they're all back and
everybody's doubled up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm waiting to see that happened
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody doubled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm waiting to see where this goes
between now and the election.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just the sad little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my weird little world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, people welcome to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if it was you or another
friend that told me that they watched a
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor put some Trump signs in the trash
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that story on a couple of
different platforms and a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: different versions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could have been fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may have fallen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, big crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: This election so bad shit that like
there's all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw one dude and when I saw this
picture, I was like, homie's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: begging for trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I saw the footage of the trouble
that inevitably happened, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they had a camera set up to catch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Homie was probably kind of begging for
trouble, but it was a huge like semi
[SPEAKER_02]: trailer, like the big full size semi
trailer worth a hay bale stacked up and
[SPEAKER_02]: then a shitload of Biden flags all over
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember what state it was in,
but I remember thinking that's a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: conservative area for such a giant Biden
display made out of obviously flammable
[SPEAKER_02]: material seems like a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few days later, it was on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: But just in our little area, it's it's fun
just watching the neighborhood go.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife ordered a couple of Biden flags
and we haven't put them up yet because we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to be the like we don't want to
one up anybody and start a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Christmas decorations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sticking to the yard sign until the
yard sign disappears.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody jacks the yard sign,
all five flags are going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys could be like like the fucking
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it in my national lampoon's
Christmas vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be like the guy hanging up super
lights, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a weird election because I'm not
like I'm not a super fan of Biden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely didn't pick Biden in the
primaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was I even remember saying to my dad,
clearly on a phone call, it was back when
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the candidates were still in right
after Bloomberg got in the race.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't know who it's going to
be right now, but I know it's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be Biden or Bloomberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had like an hour long conversation
about how we were sure it wasn't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be either of those candidates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But along this track, while we're talking
politics on a weed show is the last
[SPEAKER_02]: episode I was on was my legalization
primer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, I don't know if I got to high or
if my script lost a page, but I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think I told you all to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of all the things not to mention,
vote, vote, vote, vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the states that have legal
cannabis, recreational legal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got there because we have a system in
place that allows citizens to put
[SPEAKER_02]: questions directly on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Citizens overcame whatever hurdles are in
place to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the word out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We convinced our parents to vote with us
and we legalized it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of places where cannabis isn't
recreationally legal, you've got to elect
[SPEAKER_02]: people to office who will do all those
first steps for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now that's a pain in the ass to
get done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Presidential candidate wise right now,
another reason we're doing a political
[SPEAKER_02]: show on a cannabis podcast, both
presidential campaigns, Trump and Biden
[SPEAKER_02]: are now clear on their marijuana
positions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Biden campaign, their policy goal is
decrim, decriminalization, no
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization, no federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to get the feds out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, it's a half step.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of states have had decrim for a lot
of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we arrested a fuckload of people for
marijuana crimes during that time because
[SPEAKER_02]: decrim doesn't mean shit for production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've got a whole ounce on you,
they call that attempted dealing anyway.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Distribution means shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get caught with 29 grams of pot in
sandwich baggies, you're a major drug
[SPEAKER_02]: trafficker under a decrim model usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, I mean, it's a step forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say it's not, but it's not
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, like if I was running for
president and wouldn't be my marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: policy, that's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a- Can I interrupt you and ask
you what your marijuana policy would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just full out legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like other industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not just like cigarettes,
but similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally quit smoking in January after
like 20 something years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been anti, or I'm as anti-tobacco
now as I've ever been in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like violently anti-tobacco or
anything, but I see them at least
[SPEAKER_02]: favorably.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never liked that particular
regulation model.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad, but it's not good either.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've already done better.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Colorado's marijuana model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't just blanket take Colorado's
model and push it over all the states
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've definitely made mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some we're working to correct now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are gleefully making worse,
but I think we're better than most places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if there was a presidential
candidate right now that said we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to put this Colorado's model on all 50
states, I'd be looking to get a tattoo of
[SPEAKER_02]: that person's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be so fucking excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you going to put it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biden 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to crash your neck, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's- I mean, honestly, for a long
time, drug legalization policy wonk like
[SPEAKER_02]: me voting for Biden fucking hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've covered their proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about the opposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is weird calling the party and the
White House the opposition at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Trump has said positive things towards
legalization in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's said lots of positive things about
medical marijuana in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's currently sending threatening
cease and desist letters to a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana campaign and a legalization
campaign because they're accurately
[SPEAKER_02]: quoting him, threatening them to stop
using things he said that support the
[SPEAKER_02]: cause they're supporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty clear he's anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sided with the rest of the right
politically here in his anti-cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like we've had all through American
history since the late 1800s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're voting based on just
cannabis, there's your sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way you wrapped that up and
made that a peaceful division.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're voting for cannabis,
Mike knows who you should vote for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you do by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really a weird approach to it to
send a cease and desist to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't even use my quotes that I said
in your campaign, even though what I said
[SPEAKER_00]: is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how can you cock block somebody from
quoting the truth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out marijuana moment for in-depth
reporting on this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw the headline and I went,
that's fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical cannabis is insanely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more advertising for the campaign
that he's against now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That campaign would have gotten a little
bit of advertising legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: However much they paid for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's got Trump money behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only would have gotten so far and
fizzled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's gotten a whole nother,
got picked up and rethrown down the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a whole nother throw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason people like me are reading
about it is because it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana is supported by like 60,
80% of the people, depending on which
[SPEAKER_02]: people you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wildly popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's popular like ice cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insanely popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disturbing that it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's illegal federally and there's still
so many restrictions on it, despite its
[SPEAKER_02]: popularity with the voters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, I mean, it's a contentious
election.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're two weeks out now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to just slap that many people for no
reason, none.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like anybody was pointing to
these quotes and it wasn't causing a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem for their campaign or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even contentious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't news at all until they sent a
cease and desist letter that was angry and
[SPEAKER_02]: threatening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's just national news.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ad campaign just expanded tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know a shitload of conservative
cannabis fanatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love cannabis and they love vote
Republican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's got to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even trying to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of Republicans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Republicans in my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm liberal about a lot of stuff,
but I'm conservative about a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not any social issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm a gun nut too, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I wasn't going to bring that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about cannabis and I'm all about a
lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to mention,
but I think if you want to have a gun,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a fucking gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you should have a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the things that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing I like is freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as my freedom isn't fucking with
your freedom and we aren't stepping on
[SPEAKER_00]: each other in any other way, that's
fucking freedom, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugs and dads and guns and the fucking
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love who you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking love what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your shit ain't my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: My shit ain't your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let's have a good time and be
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I definitely wanted to get on the
show and do a little, here's where the
[SPEAKER_02]: candidates are at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace for the growth of the heart
community, the IRA army.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you all look to me for some of that
stuff and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were on the fence and looking
for a cannabis reason to vote A or B,
[SPEAKER_02]: there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of the audience watching the
dreadlocked white guy with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: show were already, most of them have
probably already made their decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hopefully maybe we encouraged a small
portion of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we just divided ourselves from some
of our friends, but either way,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoyed the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your contribution to the
show, the community, for what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like you got something to say,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just the group in our community that
I really reached out to are the group that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't vote or the group that hate left and
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they vote third party or don't vote at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the people that think everything sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why bother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's literally just made up of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird to think that if me and Jeff
are a little older and a lot less stony,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we could be senators or presidents or
Supreme court justices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that say that voting doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people that if I took you to
a restaurant and I gave you the menu and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, I don't care, just bring me
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I bring you fucking mashed potatoes and
chicken wings, that's what you fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're stuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would have voted, you could have
looked at the menu and maybe you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have said, I want soup and a salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could have considered that instead
you didn't even bother to show up and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got fucking cold mashed potatoes
and fucking chicken wings, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're happy being a four year old
at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's brutal for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm crazy liberal about a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Biden and Obama before him are very
center politically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a left and a right when you
talk about politics and they're smack in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle center between right and left.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have a left as far as
politics is concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parties are concerned in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a center and we have a far to the
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over my lifetime or our lifetimes,
we've watched it go from a little left to
[SPEAKER_02]: center and right of center to way,
way right of center and smack dead middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that has to do with young
people tend to be more liberal on stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and more left leaning and just don't vote
in primaries and small races and small
[SPEAKER_02]: elections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turnouts getting much better for the
presidential elections, but in the
[SPEAKER_02]: primaries, it's minimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, everybody's like,
man, I wish I was voting for Bernie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, dude's been in Congress
as long as Biden, he just never built that
[SPEAKER_02]: coalition of people that are going to go
nuts in the primary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that younger voter base.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get out to the other
elections and it's just not happening
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the cannabis community,
we're so fucking big.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could unify even for a minute,
it would change shit globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so hard to get us on the same
page about anything, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Simpsons nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: South park nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family guy nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to vote to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was yesterday, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that's how a lot of us play
the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys pick up a stone or friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out and vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your friends out to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure they're registered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure they can go down election day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in line together, sit there and
bullshit together if you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media will help you register to
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and Facebook are making it
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you open up one of those apps or
everybody's on either Instagram or
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook or something on your phone,
every app you open right now on the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, are you registered to vote
because they want you to participate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're still not registered to vote,
it's because you're actively ducking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making it as easy as it's ever
been in our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel for places where I'm watching
people wait five, six, eight, 11 hours to
[SPEAKER_02]: vote, even this early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are showing up in wrecking
numbers all over the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're waiting in huge lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Colorado, I think the longest I've
waited in the last 10 years to vote is
[SPEAKER_02]: like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that was because the
elevator's slow in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, it took me about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open up the ballot, scribble in some
bubbles because I know who I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for, go in and scribble all my marks,
fold it back up, sign it, put it in an
[SPEAKER_00]: envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few blocks from my house,
there's a little, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, they took a big trash can and fucking
put a lid on it and poked a hole in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the official ballot box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you put your ballots, but you drop
them all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took me just a couple of minutes and
drove up, jumped out of the car,
[SPEAKER_02]: threw it in their collection box,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took a couple more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more secure than it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more secure than it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took two with me so that some other people
didn't have to go out and face COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions so they could just stay on the
couch and watch the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got three ballots delivered all in
one move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, if you guys are out
there and you need to vote, go,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you got a stoner friend that won't
vote, go pick them up, take them to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help them to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us got ballots in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go over to their house and help them
fill that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't vote, you don't get to
bitch and complain about how things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, literally if you, if you say
that it sucks, you don't participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're the reason it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's your choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people not voting are why shitty
people stay in elected office forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because familiarity is comforting and
people just don't vote in the numbers they
[SPEAKER_02]: need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like our country seeks out other countries
when they vote and we put it on the news
[SPEAKER_02]: and we clap and applaud when they vote,
but we don't go turn out to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, please go vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even care who you vote for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get out and vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not once you're there, it's real
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, a lot of people can vote
on, you can't do it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it through the mail right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your ballot comes in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to scribble in bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know anything other than
that, you're registered when the ballot
[SPEAKER_02]: shows up at your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's all, you know, is that you want
to vote when the ballot shows up at your
[SPEAKER_02]: house, you've got all the time in the
world to sit there and what's Joe Biden
[SPEAKER_02]: think about this, spend a couple hours on
his page, spend a couple hours watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Videos of him talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Trump think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple hours watching him talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you all have seen a ballot so far in
this election, you know that those two
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't the only two listed under who do
you want to vote for for president?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you all want to vote for Kanye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out his platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't vote for that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking, looking at the ballot this
year with all the different questions on
[SPEAKER_02]: it, what a pain in the ass it would be if
you had to go stay in a voting booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And know all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want a crib sheet before I
went into the voting booth, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made one before I even started voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had a paper, like a guideline to
help me while I was doing my own ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't make any mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to fill in all the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know one, you don't have to
fill in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's some local shit that you're
like, I don't even know what the fuck that
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just skip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a test in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you can vote for the president.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whoever else you want that you're
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like 170 fucking bubbles on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill out five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two people locally this round
that I do not like as people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do not like his candidates who were
running on a post.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they didn't get a vote from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're running on a post.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nobody to vote against,
but they don't get my vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on election night, they're going to
see it because they're going to get their
[SPEAKER_02]: vote at the end of the vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you watch the news, it's called an
undervote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they list it for like,
say, for example, Biden voters in our
[SPEAKER_02]: area, the people down the ticket Democrat,
if they get less votes than Biden did,
[SPEAKER_02]: they listed as an undervote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can be like, Jeff got a thousand
votes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike only got 740.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll say it underneath that I'm pointed
out as an undervote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my little dig to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just wrote my name in the
opposition spot and voted for me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Missed opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, people, please vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we're rambling about voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get out and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I promise you, the next podcast will
be heavily cannabis oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've made it this far, you probably
aren't too concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try not to let Mike know that-
Should we do something cannabis-y?
[SPEAKER_00]: People checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to you, Mike, if they're
interested in cannabis, but if they're
interested in cannabis, they're probably
going to vote for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're interested in cannabis,
it's only they've already checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't even know that we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the video numbers on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have you here because you may not
get all of the viewers, but the few that
[SPEAKER_00]: do stick around for you, not the few,
the kind of folks that do, they fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a cult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always going to have you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white Mike division of the Airy army.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not put it that way again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, your, your little sect is a,
you definitely have your own little,
[SPEAKER_00]: your club in the back of the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I absolutely love all the shout outs
and the support I get through emails and
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon and feel free to reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like chatting and I'm stuck at home with
the kids all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll probably reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to tell them how to reach
out, you got to tell them how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's patreon forward slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me at Twitter at Nemo punk
15.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good toss there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was going to say was, Oh,
support Mike on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the cool kids are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike typed in 720.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm giving him 720 and not 710 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he did that on purpose,
but just slapping it together there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're a 311 fan, I'm surprised you
don't have a 311 tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just the thing I thought you
should.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the new tiers that's going
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little list planned out of
different stuff I want to do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if y'all have any ideas, feel free to
shoot it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm kind of reaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got new stuff coming up and there
will be more Patreon things involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I, I smile so much when I think
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done so many cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't reveal it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the kind of guy that like,
if I built a new car from the ground up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't see that car until it had
nitrous in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fucking flying down the track
would be the debut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my shit doesn't have nitrous and
wheels yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we put some wheels on this bitch,
we will put it on the track and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but support Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's where I think I was going with
that.

[SPEAKER_02]: new and improved studio.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it would.

mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

something to talk about, if you just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to hang out, bro, send me a message.

[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike said it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's time to wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll be back in a couple of days with
the solo show that will be heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave the politics and the nonsense
out of the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was very important in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I want to give a big shout out to a
listener who goes by JG and until next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mama hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
