[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you noticed
I did not mention an episode number at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I put out Thursday content
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have ran out of throwback Thursday
episodes and I am not sure if I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put together a quick Thursday show for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since this came out on Monday,
if you did get Thursday content,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you did not, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: By not stating a number at the top of the
episode, I do not create any confusion and
[SPEAKER_00]: I also get to dodge all the internet
trolls that want to tell me that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for joining me,
no matter what episode number this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am dabbing on some
concentrates I want to tell you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got some Sour Clem for my friends
at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, I don't say this word often,
but it's fucking amazeballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate is one of my favorites
I've grabbed in a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This batch is super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Sour Clem Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take their Ambrosia, which is their
proprietary texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got crystals and turp liquids in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice, but I prefer the batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take the Ambrosia and then they
simply whip the shit out of it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: battery consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little bit of a bright
orange cheesecake or bright yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yellow, goldish orange cheesecake or
cake batter is the texture, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: inside this little jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the smell coming out of here,
the aroma, let me hold it up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can smell it through the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that coming through your speakers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells, so it's Sour Clem, which tells
me it's probably Sour Diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Clementine comes through strong with
that sweetness, but the sour comes through
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like sweet and sour dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of that dryer sheet sort
of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you've heard me explain the
smell of Hash's dryer sheets before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's Terpenaline is the the
terpenoid that smells like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like somebody wrapped a Sour
Diesel nugget in a sweet dryer sheet
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it may not be the most
pleasant, but if you could smell it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the texture is nice also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slightly firm cheesecake batter is
the texture of it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do with it, I like to
take the Sour Clem batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take all of the batters to tell
you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to dip it in the high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been taking the Sour Clem and I
put it in the extreme oranges crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a super great dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm in such a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm all rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are in a good mood also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm rambly, I hope you are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that some shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make up words if I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, thanks for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, this podcast is
brought to you by our friends at the Hella
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to add some seeds to your
lineup, I highly recommend the Hella Dank
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Bank at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got all of the fresh irie genetics
drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check them out at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, speaking of dank stuff,
I recently found out that the crew at Rare
[SPEAKER_00]: Dankness listens to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast in their facility while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're listening in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're listening in the
trim area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're listening in the
package area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's being played in the
retail area, but wherever it is being
[SPEAKER_00]: played, I am honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rare Dankness facility is the most
impressive, most well thought out,
[SPEAKER_00]: most well designed and most well run
facility in Colorado, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be something bigger,
better, badder, shinier out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen or heard of it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody pointed out to me so I can be
fucking amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're listening to my podcast in
that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot because Scott is a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott is a leader in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if his crew is listening to me,
that means I'm doing something right
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've got all the knowledge they
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: At their fingertips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott is a weed wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott is every bit as qualified to educate
and talk about cannabis as myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott used to be on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott's wife used to be on the forums and
I used to read their posts and learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they were reading mine and
learning from me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was learning from Scott and now
Scott is Scott's crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Scott's doing it
personally, but Scott's crew is listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to my podcast in Scott's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an honor to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit gushing and rambling about it,
but huge shout out to everybody at Rare
[SPEAKER_00]: Dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are ever in Denver,
make sure you check out the House of
[SPEAKER_00]: Dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were voted the best dispensary on the
planet by High Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drop in, see what they've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've got a couple of
emails I would like to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just dropped $20 into the Patreon
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, that is a good way to get me to
read your email right away on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he says, thanks for all the grow
info and entertainment on the GFYH
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: One quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you talking in the past about
mixing different pest control applications
[SPEAKER_00]: with other beneficial additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you review some of your best
practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep twisting them dreads and smoking the
bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signs the email ChefDHO of Kush
Culinary in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ChefDHO is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have talked about mixing different
pesticides and different beneficials into
[SPEAKER_00]: a sprayer and applying them at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called a tank mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very doable, very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a common practice in the
agricultural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really working on keeping pests
out of your garden, the best way to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: is through multiple modes of attack,
which is using different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides that will attack in different
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I stomp on your foot and punch you in
the nose and stab you in the stomach all
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time, you're not sure which to
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come at your pests the same way,
they're not going to want to come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to hit them with multiple modes
of attack and figure out the ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop the least amount of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do that is to mix multiple
things into a tank and spray it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can mix a lot of different
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be careful and make sure
that you're not going to cause a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you mix anything into a tank,
okay, let me, let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you even start playing with
pesticides, read the label carefully on
[SPEAKER_00]: every pesticide you are going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about the personal protective
equipment that is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is very serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask Elijah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elijah was exposed to a pesticide and his
whole body broke out in hives and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: itchy and he had a fever and he looked
uncomfortable and scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very minor exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the long-term effects
of that exposure was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: He touched the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit grew on his skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if something's going to come
up in the future from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He should be fine, but he could have
problems and we do not know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be very careful with personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear, everything requires pants and long
sleeves and gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear at least that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you go, before you pick up a
bottle, you should have eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could not have the lid on all the way
and shake it and put that shit right in
[SPEAKER_00]: your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't even thought you were going to
unscrew the bottle and you've already
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking got stuff in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear eye protection, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear extra personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's extra goggles, a respirator,
a bunny suit, extra gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that be a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover up excessively if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, no matter what you're mixing,
use the proper personal protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, read the label of whatever product
you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read what to do if you get it in your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read what to do if you swallow some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how dangerous the product you are
working with is.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how toxic it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what kind of problems it could cause
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're alone in your gardening,
let somebody know that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply these pesticides and that maybe if
they don't hear from you in an hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody should check on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do something like that just to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seriously know a guy who was mixing his
nutrients and got a product in his eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: and had to call 911 with Siri.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to unlock his phone with his
thumbprint and have Siri call 911 and come
[SPEAKER_00]: to his house and help him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing they wanted to know
was what did you get in your eyes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first question they asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, it's the bottle on the
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, have the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something goes wrong, don't put the
bottle away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the bottle out to where if something
does go wrong, that you can get the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anything bad to happen to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if something does happen, we want to
be able to help as quickly and effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, have the bottle where it is findable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're mixing several bottles,
leave those out until you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you're... I know it sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave them out until you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to make a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But leave them out until you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case something goes wrong, somebody can
say, maybe he was using this pile of
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to help yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, read the fucking label, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the proper protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're going to mix pesticides,
find the application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says use this many milliliters per
gallon, pour yourself a half a gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use half of that or half of the dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour it into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it like you're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a couple of minutes to emulsify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're going to add another
pesticide or another fungicide,
[SPEAKER_00]: apply that at half the rate that you
intend or at half of the dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended on the bottle or half of
whatever you're going to use per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in a half gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if those two things do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it makes gas or bubbles or sizzles,
or if it burns your lungs or eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you're doing this outside,
but get rid of it safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to apply that shit to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got a half a gallon to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a quarter gallon is smarter for
this, but I don't have a quarter gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you mix shit together in a large
batch, you can probably mix most of your
[SPEAKER_00]: common pesticides together, but a lot of
them are oily and it's going to get really
[SPEAKER_00]: thick if you go mixing a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this listener is asking about mainly,
he said, remember me talking about mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: different pest control applications with
beneficial additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mix Evergreen or Azimax,
and I will also mix Push from Hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: Research or VegBloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's VegBloom as their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by Hydroponic Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mix Push in there with my
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you have to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to read the product label and see
if there's something in your one product
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to destroy the other
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good example that I can
come up with off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in flower, I would spray powdery
mildew with Cease and Double Nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be my two go-to products to
take down powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cease and Double Nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write this down if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do 45 milliliters of Cease per
gallon and 45 milliliters of Double Nickel
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon, and I would spray it and I
would use kind of an aggressive,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a paint sprayer, and I would put it
at sort of an aggressive setting and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to hose the shit out of the plants and
knock that PM off and also destruct and
[SPEAKER_00]: leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the Cease and the Nickel are doing is
they are beneficial bacteria that will
[SPEAKER_00]: leave a layer on the plants and disrupt
the growth of the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: These beneficial bacteria do not harm the
plants or people, and they won't cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that the powdery mildew will
cause, and they will not allow the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew to colonize on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're applying bacterias that are
helpful, and they will destroy the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria we do not want there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, later in flower, if the powdery
mildew gets thicker, you're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use a product called Xerotol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xerotol is a mixture of basically vinegar
and hydrogen peroxide, and it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty feet and assholes and a gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's disgusting, but it dissolves
powdery mildew on contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to touch the powdery mildew,
but it will dissolve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it also will destroy Double
Nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beneficial bacteria in Double Nickel
would be destroyed by Xerotol,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the beneficial bacteria in Cease will
not be destroyed by Xerotol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can mix Cease and Xerotol in a
sprayer together and apply them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mixing Nickel and Xerotol together
would be a waste of your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things to think about when it
comes to mixing pesticides and fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Xerotol, you spray that on the
plants, and it basically destroys the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it's a vinegar and basically
hydrogen peroxide, it's not exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, but it's what it smells like,
and that's basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's those two products,
they dissolve and dissipate and break down
[SPEAKER_00]: and disappear very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can destroy the powdery mildew
with the Xerotol and the Cease
[SPEAKER_00]: application, and then you can go back in a
couple of days and you can actually apply
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cease and Double Nickel again to
colonize and help keep down the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew if you feel as you've knocked it
out with the first Xerotol application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, go back with the Xerotol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe increase it a little bit,
but not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the Xerotol and the Cease application
again, and hopefully you can get that
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are things you can mix together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cease and Double Nickel, you can mix those
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Nickel and Xerotol wouldn't work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cease and Xerotol, that's gonna work well
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other pesticides that I have had good
experience tank mixing together have been
[SPEAKER_00]: things like Venerate, Double Nickel,
and Push.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good spray for
preventatives for almost all insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like, I'm trying not to give away
too many of my secrets here, but I'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to share some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's a good example of an actual
spray that I would apply to veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a lot of products in it,
but will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do, should I tell you how many
milliliters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, 15 milliliters of Evergreen,
50 milliliters of Push from Veg Bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 milliliters of Venerate, 45 milliliters
of Double Nickel, and two mills of Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that sounds like a lot of
products, but you're gonna be hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: pests from multiple angles, and then spray
them again in a few days and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: switch out the Evergreen and switch that
for Azimax, and then drop the Venerate and
[SPEAKER_00]: switch it for Botanogard Max, and that way
you are hitting at every angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're switching so you're not
getting any resistance, and that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take down just about any bug infestation
in your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we are spraying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got, there's Evergreen in there,
which is, what's it, Pyrethrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Venerate in there, which I don't
even remember the active ingredient in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Double Nickel, which is a
beneficial bacteria, which will prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew and also pisses off spider
mites, but then we're adding the Push.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Push is a, what did you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A beneficial additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Push is a beneficial additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cal Mag is also a beneficial additive,
so we're mixing those in right on in with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a new grower, I would want to
spray multiple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, I want to spray my
plants with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember what product it was,
but I was like, I also have to hit them
[SPEAKER_00]: for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means I have to hit them today and
tomorrow with a fuller feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even realize I could just tank
mix all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took a long time for me to realize
you could just mix it all into one tank,
[SPEAKER_00]: mix it up, maybe put a little Cocoa Wet in
there to make it stick to the leaves a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better, and then just blast it
on the plants all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something you will need to think
about, some oily products and sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: products will cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray all of the plants right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe mix up a small batch with a pump
spray or with a hand sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go spray one or two plants with
your new product and see if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to destroy anything, because it is plant
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is grow room sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the health of your plants
that you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful, mix a test batch,
spray a test plant, spray your plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one plant that you're going
to test spray, pull it out of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: area, get it away from the lights,
spray that plant by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you wear all of the personal
protective equipment that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend that you write down
exactly how many milliliters of each
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you used and write down the
date that you applied those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since I'm on this trip, think about
what you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only apply products that are approved by
the Colorado Department of Agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a personal grow that is not part of
the MED grow that I still use those
[SPEAKER_00]: practices in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any personal garden that I help with,
that I run myself or that I set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage everybody to follow MED and
Department of Agriculture guidelines,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what we're going to have to
do in the future anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess to make a long story short,
yeah, you can tank mix a bunch of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just test it first and test it on a test
plant before you spray the whole garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am not some sort of cannabis
wizard or weed genius or ganja guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have simply tried a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post pictures of great things on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post pictures of my successes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about and brag about my wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't share my loses, my loses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking see, I'm going to leave that one
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't share my losses and my failures
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to keep in mind for every
three cool things you see that I post,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were probably 10 or 20 things that I
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I learned how to do those
three cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to expand your
knowledge by fucking up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make mistakes, and you learn along
the way, and you are making mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're trying new shit,
you're not making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just haven't found the exact way to do
what you were thinking of yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're learning to ride a skateboard
and you're trying to do a kick flip,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have to learn how to ollie and get
that board up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you got it up off the
ground, you got to learn how to flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get it flipping,
you got to learn how to get your feet back
[SPEAKER_00]: on it and land it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those first hundred kick flips are going
to suck and you're not going to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing, but you're not failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just haven't got there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to land one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you land one, now you can do
kick flips and now you just got to perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start throwing them kick flips in the
grow, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit skating in straight lines because
your grow is never going to look any
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your skills aren't going to advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to be doing the same old
thing forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start throwing some kick flips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to crash a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fall down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a bloody knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what happens when you fall
down when you're growing weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You kill a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy more dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking try it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt nearly as bad as when you
crash when you're skateboarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my pep talk for today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to say a huge thank you to my
friend Chef D.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: of Kush Culinary in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chef, you threw down $20 in my Patreon
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there would like to
send me an email, it's growfromyourheart
[SPEAKER_00]: at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you'd like to check out the
Patreon campaign, just go to patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a listener who called
themselves Senior Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: The subject is big fan, need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, thank you for all you do for
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've helped me in a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've helped me a lot in my pursuit of
good wholesome natural medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, first off, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I was able to help you in
your pursuit for natural wholesome
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a real problem when it comes to
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strains would you recommend for
dealing with this affliction?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had folks tell me this and that,
but I really don't trust what they've told
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some research myself,
but I just wanted to know if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone personally that battles with this
and what they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any help would greatly be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also says, you answered an
Instagram question for me once before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Senior Smith, I'm glad I was able to
help you out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad I'm able to get this
opportunity to help you out again,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is something a lot of people
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety seems to be sweeping our nation or
community, our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is getting anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the world is getting fucking crazy
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why people are anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked, do you know anybody personally
that battles with this and what they use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a nervous fucking wreck sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I've got a brain injury and
also some things in the past give me
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got anxiety, so I know how to talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get into recommending strains for
your anxiety, let me say that not all
[SPEAKER_00]: people have the same body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all strains work the same for all
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like really strong sativas for my
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got a traumatic brain injury and
sometimes I feel like the thoughts start
[SPEAKER_00]: on side A and just will not connect to
side B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somewhere in the middle there,
the fucking telephone line is just
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing and the information is just not
getting to where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts making me anxious and I get
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will smoke a dab of really high
THC, really strong dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will feel that tangled telephone
wire in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll feel that shit unravel and all the
connectors go, huh, now I know where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the information can travel down
the right pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's things like lemon Jeffrey
really helps out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost anything lemon flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon turps really seem to work well
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And orange turps, extreme tangerines,
screamin' tangerines, extreme oranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy, jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that really work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very dear friend who I don't
want to call them out and say their name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somebody really close to me has an
anxiety issue and they smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clementine is what they say stops
their anxiety from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are strong sativas that seem to
work for me and somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure your body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those sativas are going to give
people anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you smoke jilly bean or lemon
Jeffrey or clementine or something in that
[SPEAKER_00]: realm and it gives you anxiety,
then you're going to have to try something
[SPEAKER_00]: at the opposite end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try LA confidential, cataract
kush, something in that realm,
[SPEAKER_00]: kosher kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are all three from DNA genetics,
but they're the opposite end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be more sedative,
more chill you out, more relax you,
[SPEAKER_00]: more put you on the couch kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think about smoking the sativas and
the limonene and the turpentine turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're so uplifting that it just changes
my mood to where I can't even be anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just in a good mood and my mind is
firing so fast that I can't stick to an
[SPEAKER_00]: anxious thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fresh like, oh, good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so high off this lemon Jeffrey dab
that I'm in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that it's just motivating and
uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the lemon Jeffrey, jilly bean,
tangy, clementine, a lot of strains like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruity, orangey kind of things work
with my anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are going to need that indica
stuff and I'll repeat those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said kosher kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what else did I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cataract kush and LA confidential are the
three from DNA genetics that I think would
[SPEAKER_00]: work for you if the other end of the
spectrum doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sativa and indicas don't work for
you, you can try CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find CBD isolates or you can find
CBD heavy flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains that may be heavy in CBD are
torabora and pennywise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two really popular CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's the ACDC, which is really
popular for being a CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are more out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things evolve every day, but you can get
CBD isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get CBD flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get high CBD concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get CBD tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get CBD everything you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure it's coming from a source
that is reputable and it's actually CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and not some imported Chinese fish oil
because you don't want to take random
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals from other countries,
get some quality shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that is not a direct science
or a prescription, but that's the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis and that's the thing about
our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite things about
medicating with cannabis is when you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor, they say, you've got this
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take this pill this often at this
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's going to work based on
everybody else's body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, most of those prescriptions will work
at that rate, at that dosage, at that
[SPEAKER_00]: interval because they've done science to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about cannabis is you can't kill
yourself with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are able to be your own guinea pig and
find out your thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out, I need six dabs every 22
minutes and I need to smoke a sativa and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can administer your medicine to
yourself and you can perfect your regimen
[SPEAKER_00]: and you won't kill yourself and you can
stay pain free or anxiety free or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: free and you can be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the greatest things about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall to that is I can't tell you
smoke a quarter gram dab of jelly bean
[SPEAKER_00]: every two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to dial that in
yourself, which means unfortunately maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to go smoke some lemon
Jeffrey and it's going to fuck you up and
[SPEAKER_00]: give you the worst panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry if that's what has to
happen, but remember that and then don't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever smoke lemon Jeffrey again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case, then smoke LA
confidential and see if it helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it is, if the LA confidential makes
you lazy or lethargic, or maybe it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: you creative and psychedelic and puts you
in a good mood, but you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to try a couple of things at the opposite
ends of the spectrum and see what works
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew your body chemistry better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew exactly what to recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that in the future, once we
figure out what we like, I know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my favorite Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how much THC I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly, but I mean,
I have a good idea of what I like from the
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling that I've experienced and from
the consuming that I've experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good idea of what works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in the future we'll be able to
go to our dispensary and we'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can I get a gram of this concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll hold, you'll hand him a card
and he'll have, it'll have your mix on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say like 97% THC with 2% terpenolene
and 1% limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's going to give you this
perfect homogenized dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just going to be like,
that's exactly what I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still to get there, you're going to
have to experiment and figure out what you
[SPEAKER_00]: like and what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I've keep repeating, I don't know
the exact prescription or recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start off by smoking flowers of
multiple different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take one or two puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how experienced you are in
cannabis, but I would definitely start
[SPEAKER_00]: light, smoke a couple puffs of one strain,
pick one and stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, that session, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go buy a bag of jilly bean, buy a bag of
lemon Jeffrey, buy a bag of LA
[SPEAKER_00]: confidential, buy a bag of cataract Kush,
smoke them at separate times so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell exactly what each one is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your normal day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to work and then come home and
take off your shoes and take a poop and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a shower and pet the dog after that
routine happens, smoke your bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do the next routine tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke your bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare the two effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if the jilly bean made you giggly or
paranoid and see if the LA confidential
[SPEAKER_00]: made you lazy or paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down if you're able.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a partner that you can
trust, they will take notes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I think it's cool because
your girlfriend or a lot of times your
[SPEAKER_00]: companion will want to be involved and
they like taking notes and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what they could, that's the way
you could bring them in on this is have
[SPEAKER_00]: them kind of observe and take notes about
your progress and see if they feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you were nicer or better to be around,
or maybe they had to talk you down and
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may be fun to have somebody around
to take some notes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Senior Smith, I feel like I've
rambled a lot about your email,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't feel like I've answered your
question directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that this is not something I
can just answer really directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be based on your brain
chemistry, your body chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: which flowers you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take some dialing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to message me, try the
strains that I recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those don't work for you,
or if they're not available, message me
[SPEAKER_00]: what is available in your area and I will
talk to you personally and we'll see what
[SPEAKER_00]: we can dial in.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get rid of the anxiety because anxiety
is a bitch and nobody should ever have to
[SPEAKER_00]: live like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Senior Smith, thanks again for
the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if I helped you out at all.
