[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on the Dude Grow Show Monday
hangout show, I think for the past four
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks in a row, and it has been a great
time, a great hangout.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of room to talk, I get a lot
of time to advertise and it's fun just
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging out with the boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They build a really nice panel show,
the Dude and Scotty are on there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they also invite a couple of cool
guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, we had Jaren as a guest,
we also had Michigan Matt was a guest on
[SPEAKER_03]: one show, our friend Hot Rod was a guest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I'm leaving out some people,
but there have been a lot of great guests
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to the Dude Grow Show for
having me on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, make sure you mark your calendar for
the Dude Grows Grower's Cup, June 1st in
[SPEAKER_03]: Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, the Dude Grows Cup returns
to Fort Collins, Colorado on June 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Irie Genetics will be there,
all of the Dude Grows crew will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you are there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all
the links and details that you may need to
[SPEAKER_03]: attend and participate in the event.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year was a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we made it through that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we need to do next?
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, I told you guys about an app on
my iPhone called the Photon app.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use it as a light meter, a PAR meter for
my grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm able to measure how much light I am
actually giving the plants instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: going, it looks bright, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have some sort of a meter,
a measuring device to show me a
[SPEAKER_03]: quantifiable number on a screen that says
they're getting this much light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it feels pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have given this app this
device a lot of good praise on the app
[SPEAKER_03]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So recently, the app has offered a new
product called a diffuser.
[SPEAKER_03]: Previously, we've been using a piece of
paper folded into a loop with a piece of
[SPEAKER_03]: paper on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're putting that over the camera of
our phone to use that as a light diffuser.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not give you 100% accurate
readings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives you a range to kind of try to be
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you repeat this the test every time the
same way, then you will get repeatable
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of say it works good here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works good here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works at 13 or 23 real well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make notes that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've put out their own diffuser.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now available through the app.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not pay me to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just to let you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned this app to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there is a product that goes along
with the app called the diffuser that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: over your camera phone that properly
diffuses the light so that you can get an
[SPEAKER_03]: accurate reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually made for your phone for
this app.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets really good reviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: The app gets even better reviews now that
we are using the diffuser from that
[SPEAKER_03]: company that makes the app.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're using the Photon app,
there's now a new product you can add to
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you open up the Photon app,
there's a thing on the right top right or
[SPEAKER_03]: top left, the little bar thing you can
click on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will open up the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy the new diffuser up your game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, they don't pay me to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that light meters are very
expensive and they are very useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have found basically a free version.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to pay about four to six bucks for
the upgrade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think the new piece is about
twenty, twenty five dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirty bucks for a really accurate light
meter is unbeatable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go look for one at a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've covered all of the business
part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's work our way into the fun part of
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a previous episode, I did mention some
of my grower pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did mention that the word synganic kind
of drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did write down another pet peeve for
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to be lighthearted about this,
but this is stuff that sometimes when I
[SPEAKER_03]: walk into a grow, it just drives me
freaking nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I don't like to see anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have evolved past and I am
still guilty of this up until recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like bamboo sticks in the grow,
especially bamboo sticks that are
[SPEAKER_03]: uncovered.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just got that pokey stick popping
up out of the end of a pot, it's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect height for me to either bend over
and poke it in my eye or kneel down to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I'm looking, it goes right in the
eyeball.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like pokey sticks in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it seems simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a small thing to be bothered
by, but they're dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also those bamboo sticks are beautiful
vectors for a place for a bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect spot for a pathogen just to
chill down inside of.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nooks and crannies and crevices,
bug eggs, little pieces of mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: All kinds of weird shit could be down in
there and they're hard to sanitize and
[SPEAKER_03]: hard to clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't like the sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to do the sticks,
if you intend to insist, get some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: new sticks that are coated in the green
shit so that you can clean them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sanitize those more regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you insist on using the sticks,
please let's put something on top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a tennis ball looks really wonky in
your grow room, but so does Noah's Ark
[SPEAKER_03]: worth of sticks popping up out of that
place as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's shy away from using too many
sticks in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're going to use so many sticks,
let's put something at the top so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't poke our precious eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be more careful, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to poke my eye while I'm
working in your grow while I'm there doing
[SPEAKER_03]: a consultation, while I'm there doing a
visit and inspection, a photo shoot,
[SPEAKER_03]: just trolling and looking around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get poked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want me to get poked either.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to poke yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's clean up, get some of those sticks
out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's use tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's use trellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's use something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, if you insist on using a
stick, get some of those green garden
[SPEAKER_03]: stakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're much better, much more reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sanitize them and then put a flag
or some tape or some shit on the top of it
[SPEAKER_03]: so that I don't poke my precious eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those sticks are going to be my pet
peeve for the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to be
the only one bitching and complaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please send me your grow room or even
cannabis culture pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_03]: What drives you crazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes you cringe when it comes to
somebody's grow room?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be your grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it out, vent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know your pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll read it here on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said before, if I read your pet
peeve here on this podcast, you,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you, you could win a free pack of
iRegenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I read your pet peeve here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_03]: a free pack of premium seeds from
iReDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have made it through all of the
advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made it through the peeves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's get to everybody's favorite
portion of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that is the question and answer
part of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to answer people's questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come in through the grow help tab on
my website.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: At iregenetics.com, there is a tab on the
top that says questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you click on that tab, we give you the
opportunity to type in your grow question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me your grow questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I read your grow question from the grow
help tab here on this podcast,
[SPEAKER_03]: guess what that means?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, you win a free pack of
iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our first question for today's podcast
came from my friend to the Roach.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard from you in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you are well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope everything is iRe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, my friend, have won a free pack of
iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send you a gift certificate for
iReDirect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick out whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will come via your email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like I should have your email
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will find it if I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got your email, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will be able to send you that gift
card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check your spam.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a gift card from me by
the time this episode comes out,
[SPEAKER_03]: check your spam or reach out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know that you did not get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the Roach sent a message and it goes a
lot like this that says, Hello Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, my buddy Roach?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to hear from you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I hope you were doing well and
enjoying your holiday season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watching the Dude Grow Show, your panel
that you were featured on and you brought
[SPEAKER_03]: up Leaf to Calyx ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this isn't really talked about
enough for beginner growers out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you go more in depth in breaking
down what this is, what to look for,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the pros and cons of such ratio?
[SPEAKER_03]: Show examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're asking for examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to show stuff, but I'll talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my state of Ohio for finally
taking it into our hands and passing
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational cannabis for the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about that part first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, big shout out to the state of Ohio
for finally legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the part that he said was taking it
into our own hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you have got to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The powers that be, the politicians,
the city council, they're not on your side
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of those types of people don't agree,
support or condone the legalization of
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational or medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got to sway your council people,
whoever they are, whatever level it is of
[SPEAKER_03]: Congress, of city council, wherever it is,
whatever level you can affect,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is up to you to make those changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody else is going to make those changes
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to the people of Ohio for,
like my friend said, taking it into their
[SPEAKER_03]: own hands and passing recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, a friend of mine was like,
yo, Rasta Jeff, I want to open up a weed
[SPEAKER_03]: business in my state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It recently legalized, but I've got to
wait to see what they do with the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I politely said, brother, don't wait
to see what they do with the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make the rules, go to the city council
meetings, go to the zoning meetings,
[SPEAKER_03]: be as involved as you can in the
legalization movement in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes time to make the rules,
be involved in that rulemaking process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way you can make good rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need people on our team, on our side in
that room setting the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, they're going to say you're
allowed to have one gram of marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: because one gram, you can smoke that for
five days and it's worth $7,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't have any more in your
possession.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should say you can have one plant and
you can only grow one plant for five years
[SPEAKER_03]: because one plant produces 32 pounds and
costs 100 gallons of water to produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to say a bunch of wonky
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need growers, they need consumers,
they need medical patients, they need
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational consumers all in that room to
make the proper decisions and rules
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding the recreational and or medical
cannabis in your area when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, when it comes time, don't forget to
put in somewhere to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the part we kind of fucked
ourselves on here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow as much as you can possibly
produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy plenty of cannabis on every
corner in Colorado, but the thing you
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot do is safely consume that cannabis
anywhere except the safety of your home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hotels won't let you smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of Airbnbs won't let you smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely are not allowed to smoke in
your car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying it doesn't happen,
but it is illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not supposed to smoke at the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is definitely illegal to smoke at the
state park, not the skate park,
[SPEAKER_03]: both probably, but any state park,
any federal land, any federal area that is
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal to possess and or consume your
cannabis on federal land, which is all of
[SPEAKER_03]: the state parks, which includes Red Rocks,
which I know that sounds crazy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that is federal land.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is illegal to consume there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did not do was give ourselves a
safe place and a safe way to consume that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the states that came after us,
New York, if you can smoke a cigarette
[SPEAKER_03]: there, you can smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the rule in New York and that's
all kinds of places in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you include some sort of safe
consumption area in your legislation when
[SPEAKER_03]: you are writing new cannabis rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I give a big shout out to Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's answer the actual question here that
came from my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got super rambly on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question here is let's talk about
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned that on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are leaves?
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know what leaves are, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaves are the leafy part hanging off of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are calyxes?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically the bud formation,
the part that builds the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you break the bud apart, those little
popcorns, little circles, those are your
[SPEAKER_03]: calyxes, your bracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what builds the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a bunch of little calyxes
stacking on topping of each other,
[SPEAKER_03]: making a big giant flower cluster is
basically what the buds are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want a lot of calyxes, a lot of bracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you look at some weed,
you'll see we're just going to say that
[SPEAKER_03]: the bud is, what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about 16 inches tall, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a 16 inch tall bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times you're going to see buds
with a leaf here, a leaf here,
[SPEAKER_03]: a leaf here, a leaf here, a leaf here,
a leaf here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a high leaf to calyx ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's, if it looks furry like a shaggy
dog, if it's a pain in the ass to trim,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's probably considered a high calyx
ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm saying that backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a high leaf to calyx ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of leaf on there compared to
how much consumable bud is going to be on
[SPEAKER_03]: that plant by the time you're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what this says is how hard or
easy is that plant to trim?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the easy way of saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaf to calyx ratio is just a fancy way of
saying how many leaves are on that plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and how hard will that plant be to trim?
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice some of the Girl Scout
cookies crosses the old school GSC,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Girl Scout cookies, the Thin Mint,
the Forum Cut, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made plants with giant petioles,
real long petioles on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then not a lot of leaf up and down the
bud, not a lot of sugar leaf on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were a home grower, if you were
kind of a lazy grower, if you were on your
[SPEAKER_03]: own and you didn't want to trim all that
shit off, you didn't really have to
[SPEAKER_03]: because all those leaves on there were
super frosty and they're just real little.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was real easy with the Girl Scout
cookies to go and break off all those
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger leaves and then just give it a
medium trim and you're ready to go because
[SPEAKER_03]: it had a low leaf high calyx ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was less leaf, more calyx,
very easy for it to trim in that
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff that comes from the Hyri
Genetics line that has got the low leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: and a high calyx ratio would be a lot of
the stuff from the Jack the Ripper crosses
[SPEAKER_03]: I made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Tripper will do it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blueberry Butcher will do it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jack Tripper stands out in that
category quite well though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see some photos I've posted or just
big old long buds with like six leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of harvest, that's really easy
to trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to pay the trim crew for as
many hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as much work, not as much
processing time, and the product is still
[SPEAKER_03]: top shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a good way to save yourself a
half of a step and possibly a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're paying a trim crew or trim
people, that is money you can keep in your
[SPEAKER_03]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a profit already that you've
already made before you even spent it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my friend, I hope I covered that for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is basically how much leaf is on that
plant based on the size of the bud that
[SPEAKER_03]: dictates kind of how hard or how long it
is going to take to trim that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It lets you kind of prepare, set yourself
up for success in your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're somebody that totally hates
trimming, you probably want plants with a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot more calyx and very little leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my buddy to the roach,
I think I answered that question quite
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, my dude, are going to get a gift
certificate for a free pack of seeds for
[SPEAKER_03]: iREDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait to see what you do with your
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, podcaster world, let's keep this
party moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have another great question here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one came from my new friend Pacific
Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh, I'm pretty sure I met you on Discord
briefly recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're definitely invited back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, everybody out there, you guys are
all welcome and invited to the iRE Army
[SPEAKER_03]: Discord server.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be a link in the show notes
or the video description.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is not there, please reach out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will get you an updated link to the
Discord server.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of great things happen in the
Discord server.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a general chat where people just
have a general chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about life, we hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a lot of grow talk happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are tabs for every strain that I
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I can't say every strain,
but most of the strains that are available
[SPEAKER_03]: and current that people know about from
iRE genetics, they're all listed on the
[SPEAKER_03]: side of the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see pictures, if you want
some info, if you want some details on a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific strain, you can go there and
click on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to grow a strain,
you want info.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're thinking about growing it,
a lot of details can be found on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Discord server.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you can post a question in the
general chat or in any category that you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of my friends and myself there
will answer those questions for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then my favorite part is the Smoker's
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Smoker's Lounge is a live interactive
chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like any other chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a Zoom chat or a what's
the other one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on StreamYard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot like a FaceTime, except there's
a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes there's 10 or 12 people hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes there's only two or three of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn on your camera and hang out
with us if you want, or you can leave the
[SPEAKER_03]: camera off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go on voice chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're able to hang out and have a
conversation with myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite often my buddy Billy Bong is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Dave is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite often Blue Kiss is hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great crew that's always hanging
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a morning crew, an afternoon crew,
a nighttime crew, and a late night crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just rotates different people
throughout the day, throughout the night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Lollipop John, big up to my
buddy Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of great people in there all day
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want someone to come hang out
with and talk about growing ganja or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: play video games with us, or a lot of
times the boys go and play VR games,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of fun stuff happening on
the Iri Army Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop in, hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a lot of exclusive deals and a lot of
heads-up happen on the Iri Army Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, my friend, I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get focused.
[SPEAKER_03]: And answer your actual question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't even gotten to that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, my buddy Pacific Josh,
you my dude, win a free pack of Iri
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic seeds from IriDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will receive a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check your email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've said before, by the time this
episode comes out, if you have not
[SPEAKER_03]: received your gift certificate,
please do check your spam and then reach
[SPEAKER_03]: out if you have not found that message.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question does go a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says,
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a fresh harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like that outdoor harvest was
hanging up.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dude went away for Thanksgiving to go
get some turkey and mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while he was away, the humidity has
plummeted in the dry and cure area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it says, My buds are pretty crumbly at
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now my advice may work for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you mean by crumbly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they fucking dusty?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they falling apart?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they dry and you're exaggerating?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they're real dry and you're
exaggerating being a drama queen about
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I've got a couple of answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: My best bet for you is I don't know how
much weed you've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much product there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can put it in big Sterlite bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're 30 quart Sterlite bins or
about this wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see that on camera?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try not to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're about two and a half, maybe three
feet wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're about 20 inches tall, maybe 20
inches deep ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the right dimensions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would put as much of the flower as
you can into those bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much you've got,
but put in the appropriate size bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would find if you've hopefully
got more plants growing, use some fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: wet leaves from a current crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just grab some of those leaves,
chop them off the plant, throw them right
[SPEAKER_03]: in that bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Less than you think you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need as many fresh leaves as you
may assume to reconstitute, rehydrate some
[SPEAKER_03]: dried up plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fresh leaves would be my first bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that is not an option, maybe some of
those Boveda packs or something similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, you're going to have to try
something extreme, and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: make any recommendations to help you ruin
the crop at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly if it's real dry, maybe you can
just make some concentrates or something
[SPEAKER_03]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everybody prefers that fresh
frozen, but it's way too late for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe at this point you can make some some
sort of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times back in the day,
dry crumbly product would become some sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of BHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to tell you to break the law
or do anything crazy, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the day would make BHO out of this
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to recommend you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legal, legal disclaimer insert here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so the humidity dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants are real crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say seal them up into a container.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put some fresh ganja leaves in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you have some fresh leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the chances of that are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're a perpetual grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this was an outdoor crop
and it's all gone, but leaves would be my
[SPEAKER_03]: first bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then a Boveda pack or something similar
like that, and then after that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have to find another way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone probably at this point is going to
tell you to put like a wet paper towel or
[SPEAKER_03]: something in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds fucking terrible, but it
probably will work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, do you have a humidifier?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can hang them in a room with a
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just sounds like you're going to
cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would try the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would try the Boveda packs, and then
after that I would think about making
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're able to save the harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you learned your lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are not the only one facing
these trials and tribulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people had struggles out there
with that outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, this goes back to something I
say a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know harvest is coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew harvest was coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew Thanksgiving was coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have prepped for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably could have prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said the humidity dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what would have fixed this?
[SPEAKER_03]: A humidifier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had nine weeks of flower,
three weeks of fucking veg at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: all to think about that humidifier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next year, you guys, set yourself up
for success.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're chopping down those big outdoor
harvests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of my friends lost like 25 to 50
percent of their outdoor because of small
[SPEAKER_03]: human error.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year, let's look at those errors and
try to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my dude Pacific Josh, thank you for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I was able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do feel for you for having a dry,
crispy crop that is never a fun thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: come home to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, we're able to help you out a
little bit in some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I hope the Thanksgiving dinner and
company was worth it, my bro.
