[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 365 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the episodes off by
letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of this bubble
jack full spectrum extract and I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and aroma of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like bubble gum and cotton
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I dab it, it goes straight to my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my brain go super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my mouth go super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this will be a great
concentrate for smoking before a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too deep into this episode,
I want to give a few people a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to my friend Jake
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a shout out to Jade and also a big
shout out to Grimbold the Druid and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Tanner Martinowick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
another Grow Lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing a long series of Grow
Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have been following along.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested, I recommend you go
back to episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I start this long series.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long series of Grow Lessons start there
and get caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're up to speed,
welcome to the Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last two episodes, we talked about
sprouting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talked about cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
putting those seeds and those clones into
[SPEAKER_00]: containers of soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about germinating in paper
towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have covered this briefly in the
previous episode, but we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it a little bit of a recap right
here just to make sure everybody is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We folded a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We soaked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put seeds on the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We folded it again to secure the seeds
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we put that in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we put that in a warm place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds have now sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they've got little tiny tails,
maybe a quarter of an inch, maybe a half
[SPEAKER_00]: inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you didn't go any more than one
inch long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is how I recommend planting those
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally try to stay away from
recommending products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I recommend a product,
I get emails from people saying I did
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to make this easy for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend Light Warrior Soil from Fox
Farms for your new seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is readily available, it is affordable,
and it works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure other people will have other
ideas and other suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend this product because like I
said, it's available, it's affordable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to send people on some crazy
mission looking for a product that's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to find or overpriced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably get away with one bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of Light Warrior Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need containers to put this soil in
to put our seedlings in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend small pots for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to fill up a big three
gallon pot and then plant a little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to water that entire
space of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to put water and nutrients in all
of that space just to water that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your seedling inside of a
little tiny cup, you only have to water
[SPEAKER_00]: that much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to waste water,
you don't have to waste nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't have to waste space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new growers really like to drown
seedlings in larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they put a seedling in a larger pot,
they've got to water all of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go and they pour an entire pitcher
of water right on top of that three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that seedling gets washed away in all
that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where it goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people apply water, they do it kind
of heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed gets washed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets lost in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kill the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fail with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend starting with a
smaller pot, maybe a four inch net pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a six inch net pot, maybe a four
inch square pot, maybe a six inch circular
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, something that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly start my seedlings in a beer
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a few beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stack them up on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put a drill through the bottom of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go through about eight cups at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I poke one big hole through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll do a few smaller holes on the
side just to give some proper drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like beer cups are the perfect
size for new baby seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings can sprout in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can develop a good root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time they get big enough,
you can just up pot them into their three
[SPEAKER_00]: or five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about actually putting these
seedlings into, I'm going to go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: beer cup for this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my light warrior soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fill my beer cup most of the
way up with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pack it down fairly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to fill it up with soil and
leave myself about a quarter of an inch so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I water, I've got plenty of room
for water and it doesn't just run off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about a quarter inch of space
left on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I water that soil before I even put
my clone or my seedling into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're going to put a
seedling in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm going with the seedling,
I do not use any nutrients at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let all that water soak through the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take my pointer finger and I dig a
little hole just right to the first
[SPEAKER_00]: knuckle of my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put that little freshly sprouted
seedling right inside that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seedling has developed a long tail,
that taproot, if that taproot has gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: long, you need to make that be facing down
and the seed facing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the seed coming up and the
taproot going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gently place that seed facing down or
the taproot facing down, the seed pointing
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place that right in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dig the hole as deep as you need to dig it
if you've got a longer taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push your finger in there as long as
you need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then gently set that taproot down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just want to put the dirt
right over it real gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that it's covered up toward
the light's not getting to it and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: packed in there tight enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water it the next time,
that water will probably pack it just
[SPEAKER_00]: tight enough for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to press it down too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you don't want to risk
crushing that seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a real short tail,
just go knuckle deep, drop that little
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling right in there and bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got kind of a long tail,
you've got to dig a little deeper of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set that tail down in there and then just
carefully bury that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be really careful not to disturb that
white taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really delicate and it's important
that it is not disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your new seedlings are basically
potted in their cups of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would place them under a T5 light with
the T5 light about 8 to 12 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to keep them around 75 to 85
degrees and I would try to keep it quite
[SPEAKER_00]: humid around these little tiny baby
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes time to water these new
seedlings, we have to be very careful for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend using a sprayer to water new
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a tiny one gallon pump sprayer from
the local hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix it with my whatever nutrient
solution I'm going to use or just plain
[SPEAKER_00]: water that's been pH balanced correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pump it real hard and I just spray
the top soil with that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of pouring, a heavy dose of water
in and risking drowning those seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting those seeds, I just spray it
from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of spray it at a few angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I get all the soil saturated and
it works just like the morning dew would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like spraying them is really
gentle and it works really well for new
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to not drown these plants and not
flood the soil when they're starting baby
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's briefly talk about when to start
feeding our seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start feeding when I see the
first set of truly developed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the first set of five or
seven or nine, depending on what variety
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing, when you see the first set
of full leaves, that's when I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: start adding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your brand and your product,
I usually recommend you start with about a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottle says to use 40 milliliters
of a certain product, I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you start with 10 milliliters of that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as that plant gets bigger and
stronger and more developed, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your nutrient feedings to those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while they're small, let's feed them
lightly so we don't roast them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about what to feed
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants need a little bit of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a very small amount of
phosphorus and a very small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your basic grow nutrients will be
just fine for small seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend adding a root inoculant
product, something like mammoth pea,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like great white, something like
recharge, something like plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of those products will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little bit of research, find what's
available in your area, find what fits
[SPEAKER_00]: your price range and get the product that
will work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is better than nothing when it
comes to root inoculants and microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it for small plants and
I highly recommend it throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your plants are little,
they're not going to need a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, just a base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend some sort of root
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't need CalMag probably until we
transplant them into the next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to add a fulvic or a humic
acid, that's always good for the plants at
[SPEAKER_00]: all stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, I mainly like to focus
on healthy plants with strong roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really focus on root development at
this stage of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add microbes and beneficial fungus
and then I'll also add carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, like I said,
I am mainly focusing on root development
[SPEAKER_00]: until I transplant those plants into their
next pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked a little bit about what to
feed these little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: For small seedlings, I like to keep my pH
around 5.8 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get a little bit larger,
I will increase the pH slowly and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: move up towards 6.3 or 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for these small babies, let's stay
closer to 5.8 or 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now really take your time increasing the
amount of nutrients you give these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and also take your time increasing the pH
of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get a root system to be able
to process all of the stuff you're giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little tiny plants don't want a lot
and you do run the risk of burning them if
[SPEAKER_00]: you overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention and go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after several days, these seedlings
will start taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting full-size leaves and
they will start catching up to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: size as the clones we cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they reach that size, I consider them
to be small veg plants and I treat them
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I do my small veg plants and we
will talk about caring for and feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: small veg plants here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, let's talk about planting our rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we planted some seedlings in rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we cut some clones into rapid
rooters and put them in a dome and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they are sprouting roots and it is time to
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know when it is time to plant
our rapid rooter seedlings or clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to plant seedlings as soon as I see
that first taproot coming out of the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to let that taproot get too
long, too leggy, and too stretchy so I do
[SPEAKER_00]: my best to get those into soil right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut clones in rapid rooters,
I like to make sure they are sufficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: rooted before I try to put them into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your clones are properly
hardened off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to expose our domed clones to
fresh air for durations of time and extend
[SPEAKER_00]: that duration over a period of time to
make sure the clones are ready to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: in a humidity controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get them used to being in our
regular veg environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been hardening off our clones and
they show sufficient roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by sufficient roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want at least five, maybe 10 or 12 white
thick roots popping out of that rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be just busting out of
there and kind of thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to look like they're just
little worms coming out looking for some
[SPEAKER_00]: more to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more than five, maybe more
than 12 and they start building up in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you are really doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to develop a nice root system
before we pot it, but there is a fine line
[SPEAKER_00]: between just enough and too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lift that little clone up out of
that tray and the roots have begun
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping around the rooter, you've gone
too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those roots are hanging down inside the
rooter tray and hanging into the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have gone too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get those into our soilless mix
as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want just a little bit of dreadlocks
just hanging out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot, just maybe a little tiny mop,
just a little fuzz ball, maybe 10 or 20 of
[SPEAKER_00]: them just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is prime time to pot those and I want
them about a half inch to an inch and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half long is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put these rapid rooters into our
beer cup full of Light Warrior soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever size pot and whatever soil mix
you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure it's a quality soil mix
with plenty of aeration and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever size or whatever container you
use has plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want our plants to get muddy at
the bottom, get stagnant water that will
[SPEAKER_00]: totally drown and destroy our roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quality soil, pots with good drainage,
that is a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just like we did the beer cups for
our small seedlings, let's fill them up
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil and leave ourselves about a
quarter of an inch of space for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I'm putting the seedlings in the
rapid rooters into this soil, I most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely will not give them nutrients at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put the clones into the soil at
this time, I do like to give them a small
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a light vegetative mix, about a
quarter strength of whatever brand you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use about a quarter strength of whatever
they recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to use a microbe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something like mammoth pea,
something like great white shark,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like recharge, something like
plus life from veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with beneficial fungus and
bacteria that will encourage root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: will be great for your small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our light base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a root inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep the pH for these small
clones somewhere between five point eight
[SPEAKER_00]: and six point two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a root inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our solution pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I water that solution through my cups
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pour it right on through until it
drains out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fully saturate that new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once it's done dripping and that soil
is fully saturated, I will take two
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers and just gently make a little hole
right in the center of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go just a little bit deeper than the
height of that rapid router.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the rapid router is an inch tall,
I go maybe an inch and one eighth or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch and a quarter deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get the rapid router out of the
little tray and I set it gently inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do my best to not disrupt any of
those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a seedling, you've probably only
got one or two roots sticking out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid router.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gently set that in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it right inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then backfill that hole really carefully
over that rapid router.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go right over the top of it so
you can never tell the rapid router was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a little plant is sticking up out
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be really careful if you're working with
the seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one taproot is all it's got to
survive through at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with a clone,
we still need to be very careful with
[SPEAKER_00]: these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, wear rubber gloves when you're
doing all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend rubber gloves whenever
you're coming in contact, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting your hands or your skin in contact
with the dirt, with the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to wear rubber gloves if you can
or latex gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to glove up whenever possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still suggest watering that rapid
router seedling with the spray bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I recommended before,
until it gets nice and large, until you're
[SPEAKER_00]: confident that you're not going to drown
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water it with that spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you fully saturate the soil,
but it's easier to not go overboard when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're spraying with the spray bottle
because you can only spray so much at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower and you don't have
a lot of experience watering plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're new at watering the clones,
don't be afraid to water them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: spray bottle also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and saturate that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep spraying until you feel like it's
saturated and then wait until it's fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: dry to water it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know when it feels real light when
you pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, oh, that needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just soak it until it's mostly
saturated again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you'll realize that you're
spending too much time using that spray
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle to water the clones and you'll
start using a more efficient method,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a great way to learn how to not
overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically fill my cup with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moisten the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a little hole with my fingers and I
set that rapid router right inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: hole really gently, really careful not to
damage any of those new roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I carefully bury that rapid router
with the moist soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put that cup underneath a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I like to keep that light eight to
12 inches above it when they're brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to scorch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to keep the temperature
somewhere between 75 and 85 degrees and I
[SPEAKER_00]: try to keep the room fairly humid when I
have new seedlings or young plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is really quickly how I put my
rapid router seedlings and clones into
[SPEAKER_00]: cups of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk next about putting our clones
from an easy cloner machine or a botanic
[SPEAKER_00]: care turbo cloner into cups of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: My method for potting these clones into
soil starts the same as potting our seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or potting our rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start by filling my cup or my desired
container with a light warrior or my
[SPEAKER_00]: desired soil-less mix about a quarter inch
away from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then saturate that soil the same as I
did with my other cloning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use about a quarter strength of my
vegetative new and I like to use plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I adjust the pH between 5.8 and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we cut these clones, I said to
leave about an inch underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: neoprene collar into the water getting hit
by that sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entire inch should have roots popping
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a nice little mop of roots
before we try to pot these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my cup of moist soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a well rooted clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I usually grab the cup with my right
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the pointer finger on my left hand
and I just poke a hole about an inch and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half deep right into that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I may widen that hole up a little bit
depending on the root mass coming off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are a lot of roots, I need more
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to crowd or crush the roots
into that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to lower the clone down into the
soil and let those roots spread as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got something hanging off,
try not to squish them, try not to coil
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to encourage those roots to spread
out as far as they can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of roots, maybe make a
small cone of soil in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup, a little triangle so that the roots
can hit that triangle and spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: around that instead of getting into a
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the roots spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we tangle them up, if we twist them,
they'll just suffocate themselves and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will kill the plant and the clone will not
survive at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your roots have gotten excessively
long, I recommend you trim some off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are more than six or seven inches
long, just go ahead and trim the bottoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of those roots off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will thank you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't have so much root mass twisted
up in the bottom of that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just have a nice, thick root mass
started and it works a little bit like
[SPEAKER_00]: topping your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just created more sections for that
root zone to branch out from so your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pop that clone up out of the EZ
Cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the neoprene disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the neoprene disc off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put that back in the hole so the water
doesn't go spraying anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got the cloner turned on
while you're potting the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you take that clone and you just set
it right inside that hole that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: created in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you lower it down into there,
try to spread the roots as far as you can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're just short and stubby,
they're going to go the direction they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting long enough to where
you can stretch them or move them and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage them which direction to go,
try to make them spread out like an
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get them nice and far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're really long, you can put soil
in the cup, lower some of the roots down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cup, then sprinkle more soil on
top of that, then lower more roots down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cup and then sprinkle more soil
on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, no matter how much soil you use,
no matter how long the roots are,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to bury that clone deep enough
into this cup to give it some support to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the soil tight enough
around it and get it deep enough in there
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the clone to support itself and
stand straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we need to not bury
it so deep that we cause root rot on that
[SPEAKER_00]: short stem that is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put one inch of it underneath the
neoprene disc getting sprayed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got roots about one inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that neoprene disc is about a quarter
of an inch deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say probably plant it somewhere
between one and a quarter and one and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half inches deep into your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've already moistened the soil,
so the nutrients are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to do is to move our potted
clones underneath a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for freshly potted plants,
I like to keep that T5 about eight to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will lower that light as the plants get
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to move them right under
there right away and scorch them and burn
[SPEAKER_00]: them and give them the opportunity to
stress out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these new baby clones, I like to keep
the temperature between 75 and 85 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do like high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much airflow I've got in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got plenty of airflow,
if I can have air exchange, I will put
[SPEAKER_00]: higher humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel like there's not a lot of
airflow and it will create problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will reduce the humidity accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep stressing it, but the most
important thing to think about when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are potting these clones from the easy
cloner, from the turbo cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to not let those dangly roots wrap up
on themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them smother themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them suffocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cloning machines can make roots
explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look in there on day five and you
won't have any roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look in there on day six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be getting roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go away for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll come back over the weekend on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are hanging down into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go crazy very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see what I'm talking about when
you get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take those fat clones with big crazy
roots and kill them by suffocating them,
[SPEAKER_00]: by coiling them up in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so at this point, we have got a
bunch of seedlings or a bunch of clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and small pots or cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them underneath T5 lights or
whatever light you've got available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a small HPS, maybe a 250
or a 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using something larger that
works, just keep it further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just raise it up real high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got it under an acceptable light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it in a desirable climate,
which is around 75 to 85 degrees with the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got somewhere between 50
and 75% humidity for your small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest either 24 hours on or
possibly 20 on and four off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a lot of people like to do 18 hours on
and six hours off for our new small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend a light fan on
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a fan to keep the air moving around
them will prevent the plants from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: leggy and stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it just makes tougher,
more robust plants when you put a little
[SPEAKER_00]: breeze on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, the clones are now in
our small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very short time, those seedlings will
catch up to what I consider the small veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, which is when they're about six
inches tall and they've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: nice sets of leaves and they can start
taking small veg nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on doing a complete episode on
small veg here in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode will include recommended
light cycles for your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode will include recommended
nutrient schedules for your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also talk about optimal environmental
conditions for your small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about transplanting our
plants into their finishing pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will consider that large veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will begin the talk about our
large veg phase.
