illegal in your location, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it, you cannot blame me if
you get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, we're going to
focus on flushing our plants.

.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I did include that link in
the show notes and in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it nice and easy for
all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have noticed that recently my
Instagram account was deactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get that account back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already following me on
Instagram, it's irie underscore genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the Monday night live
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right on Instagram every Monday,
approximately seven 10 PM mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do go live on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fire up the live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We listen to some music and I answer
cultivation and cannabis culture questions
[SPEAKER_00]: live on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw up your grow questions, throw up
your grow ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your questions, make some
comments and let you know what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me Monday, approximately seven 10
PM mountain time on the Instagram live
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get a notification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be shadow band at this time on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have to give me a follow then
around seven 10 PM mountain time,
[SPEAKER_00]: open up the Instagram app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up at the top, you'll see my little
icon and my name with the red circle
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a red or a green circle around
it, that means I may be live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that, check out the live feed,
hang out with us, leave some comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer your comments there in the
live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to rely less on Instagram and
other social media platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are attacking and banning cannabis
related content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to support them if they're
not going to support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am going to do is focus my energy
more on the discord server and more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis definitely supports cannabis
friendly content.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free app you can download for your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Download it just like any other app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create an account just like all the other
apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Log in, post your cannabis friendly
photos, your dab videos, your bong rip
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, your duck face smoking videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your cool cannabis photography is
invited and promoted and encouraged on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other place you will find me more
frequently is on my discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an iri genetics, iri army grow
from your heart podcast discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great people hanging
out there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've built me a wonderful community
over there on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be on the discord more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reached over a thousand members.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently gave away a few prize packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be giving away more prize packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be hanging out in the live chat,
the video chat, the voice chat,
[SPEAKER_00]: more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us over on the discord channel,
the discord server and big thanks to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who has signed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over a thousand members on
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently added a page, a discord page
for every iri genetic strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can go and post pictures of strain
specific strains under those tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're curious about growing a strain
or have questions, you can go there and
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with all of the people on the
discord and see their experiences,
[SPEAKER_00]: their photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask them questions, have strain
specific conversations on the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are constantly working on, on improving
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the gang over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have noticed I did take a little
bit of a social media break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit overwhelmed with a lot
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of email happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of social media
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on six or seven different apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produce a couple of different podcast
episodes every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to hang out with friends and family
and have a real life outside of all this
[SPEAKER_00]: iri genetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did kind of take a little bit of a break
from social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to just for a, not just for mental
health reasons, but for real life reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was other shit that had to be done
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is outdoor grow season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some things happening
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some other things happening
since it's summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to go outside and go to
events again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do as much of that as I can,
but I am trying to get back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: social media a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been waiting for a message
reply, if you've been waiting to see me
[SPEAKER_00]: post or something, it will be happening
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be on Facebook, but you will
see me more active on social media again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not even real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, everybody's just creating a
bubble on there that doesn't even really
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let it overwhelm you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it become part of a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is supposed to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposed to enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it got that overwhelming,
I just gave up and signed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my account got deleted, it was almost
relieving, but I missed all my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: my DMs, so I had to go find all my friends
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad I found you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am chattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of yourself when you're
working with social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get to your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is not even real.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the time, those people wouldn't say
half of what they're saying if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: in a room with people, but we just get
weird with phones and computers in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to another very important topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got something very important I want
to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody drew this for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here, there's going to be a logo
popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know that they drew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They designed this for me, and they sent
it to me, and it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it in a few places,
and I owe you a prize, a gift,
[SPEAKER_00]: a thank you, and I can't find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I save the artist's name
and the file name.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saved the file, this file has been
moved from computer to computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: from drive to drive, and I failed at
saving the file name with the person's
[SPEAKER_00]: name in it, so I need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know who made this, if you made
this, please send me your email address,
[SPEAKER_00]: your mailing address, maybe your shirt
size, and I am going to pay you back for
[SPEAKER_00]: making this artwork right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to quit doing that because every
time I do it, I have to put the image back
[SPEAKER_00]: in, and that's more editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great artwork,
and you folks that did submit art,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, I took kind of a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back through all the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back through the file folders,
and when I'm using your art, you will get
[SPEAKER_00]: gifts for your submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making sure to catch up, get everybody
caught up, make sure that you know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do appreciate your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I didn't use your art,
if I find it in a folder, I'm going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to send you something because you did put
work in, so thank you, and don't be shy to
[SPEAKER_00]: send more music and artwork to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice I'm using different
artwork, making different intros,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to talk about
flushing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend say that he thought he
messed up his crop because he did not
[SPEAKER_00]: flush between the veg phase and the
flowering phase, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no need to flush then,
and he's like, oh, my friends tell me that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to flush, and I think he means the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet says that he has to flush
between the veg phase and the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, and I said, if you didn't do
anything wrong, rather, there's no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: to flush during that phase, and then he
said that he was taught that he should
[SPEAKER_00]: flush often to fix problems, and I think
that from what I have noticed in most
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, unless you've got a major,
major, major problem, flushing usually
[SPEAKER_00]: just causes more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk a little bit about
flushing at the end of the growth cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing pre-harvest a little bit,
but let's talk a little bit about a
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-grow flush and a flush to solve
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you've got a problem,
so what am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me kind of recap what I'm even talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a problem in your plants,
people will say that they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say maybe a nutrient lockout or a
nutrient burn or an under some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that they can't completely
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, their first move is to
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get a container of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will put the pH at whatever pH
they're used to using, and they will just
[SPEAKER_00]: over-water the plant in an attempt to wash
everything out of the root zone and start
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea, but wouldn't it be a
better idea, in my opinion, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: rinsing out that root zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to just over-water it to
where now it's over-watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got two problems, and now your
third problem that you're going to create
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it doesn't have any nutrients in
its root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's got problem number one that we
haven't identified and we just panic
[SPEAKER_00]: flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, now it's over-watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem number three, now there's no
nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now whatever it was overdone or deficient
on, now it's definitely fucked because we
[SPEAKER_00]: just completely rinsed out everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people always say, it had this problem,
I flushed, and now they're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rarely hear people say, I had this
problem, I flushed, and I fixed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more calls of saying, dude,
I flushed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like shit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, just let them dry out and feed
them properly, and then they'll be back on
[SPEAKER_00]: track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you're going to do a panic
flush, why not mix up a solid feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it like a triage feed or just a
solid diet or a good meal plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went to the doctor and you're sick
and you got some problems, the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to do is stick an IV in you
and get you some vitamins and get you
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's mix up a good batch of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your basic feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you normally feeding this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your calcium, magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your basic nutrients that
these plants need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some fulvic acid in there to
help them uptake?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some carbs in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some microbes in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have things in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: To put this plant in its top performance,
whatever phase you're in, if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, if you're in flour, mix up a really
nice mix, some base nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Cal Mag, some microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good solid mix in there,
get the pH adjusted perfectly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then water that to runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you're going to do, you're going
to rinse out all the old shit that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to fall right out of the bottom
as the plants get runoff and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put a brand new meal in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like delivering fucking soup and a
sandwich to a sick friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been eating fucking energy bars
and drinking Gatorades all day because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've just been sick and struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your plant's been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just gave it soup and a sandwich
and a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really probably the best you
could do for it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think like a mid-grow or a mid-cycle
flush is probably more detrimental than it
[SPEAKER_00]: is helpful to our plants in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do have like a major,
major, major lockout or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you might want to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, just do plain
water or maybe do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of flushing products in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sugars in there do help unbind the
salt into what's happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may work, but unless you've got
major, major issues, I don't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing during the growth cycle is a good
idea, a necessary idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to cause you more
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make the plants thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they already had one problem to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just compounding problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not mix up something that we know is
good for the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when people are sick, you don't just
give them a bunch of water and hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: they just pee everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to give them nutrients in a meal
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, bring them soup in a
sandwich, maybe a multivitamin,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a kombucha to get some probiotics in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to take care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep repeating myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mid-cycle flush might be kind of
silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I've been talking about so
far applies to a soilless mix type of a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're using Fox Farms or some soil
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this would apply to something
with bottled nutrients, that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessary to flush your
plants mid-grow with a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a missed opportunity for a
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big problem, if you see
something is completely off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any case, the first step, the first
thing to do is identify the deficiency or
[SPEAKER_00]: the overfeed or the toxicity or whatever
the problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first step is to identify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, like I said before, mix up that
proper feed if you know what's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're giving too much
of, don't feed it that this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've given it too little of
something, add some of that this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adjust your nutrients and then get
that in the reservoir and get it fed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to run a lot of plain water
through a hydro system and not feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we're doing hydroponics is to
get as many feeds as possible to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: beef up those plants and get as many
nutrients into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're missing an opportunity to feed
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should just mix up the feed that they
need and get it to them every time instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing just plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step in any case to solving a
nutrient issue, whether it's over or
[SPEAKER_00]: underfeed, is to identify the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What nutrient are we missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it is two nutrients
working together or against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice if you overfeed one thing,
you'll see a problem with another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you underfeed one thing, you'll see a
problem with a different nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work in balance together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep good notes of everything that you
fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep good notes of your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep good notes of your EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may even want to measure the EC and pH
going in and coming out of your plants if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help us diagnose a problem and
then adjust to make corrections,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit harder in a soil-less
mix because you got all that soil-less
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a lot of PPMs of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know exactly what we're putting in
a hydroponic mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read my notes and see where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up a good feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why would you starve the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just water them, but why would
you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to make them hungry also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like telling a sick person,
like, starve for a day and then I'll try
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out what's wrong with you and
then we'll diagnose it and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking fix you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, don't make them feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up a solid feed with the appropriate
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust the appropriate pH for your time in
the grow and what your garden is used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the pH is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure that your pH pen is
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw somebody that has been adjusting
their pH with a pen that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: miscalibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For quite a while, so everything looked
like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought the pH was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pen was off, so it was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your pens are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then reset that soil with a good feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you just water everything into that
soil with that good nutrient mix with the
[SPEAKER_00]: good pH balance, you just kind of reset
that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will start drinking all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get more active and they'll start
recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see the burn and stuff
is not going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got crispy leaves and crinkled
up shit like that, it's not going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the new growth won't be as terrible
and beat up, but you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to pull off some of those
crispy, bad, dead, funky, ugly leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those do invite more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs kind of see those yellow leaves
as weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use yellow sticky traps,
because the bugs like spider mites and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that see the yellow and they
say that plant should be green,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that little protective layer
on the outside is probably good and weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get in there and start munching and
get the plant juices out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get those yellow, funky, ugly,
crinkly, crusty, dry leaves out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep all the green, healthy foliage
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save that, rescue that focus on the new
stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about something a little
bit controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That honestly, this is all bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any science behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am debating and readjusting and
rethinking my stance on flushing our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough real scientific data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the scientific machines to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can tell you is by burning it,
by smoking it, by consuming it,
[SPEAKER_00]: by extracting it, by enjoying it or not
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only testing that I've got and
that's kind of what matters because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had some lab equipment tell me
that my weed was good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing and this is the end of harvest or
the end of the cycle pre harvest flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been feeding our plants for nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to preach the flush for 10 to 14
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of debate in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is what do we think we're
flushing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a plant and there are buds
and nutrients have been put into that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and they've been photosynthesized or
metabolized and turned into plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fibers and terpenes and there's a
bunch of different components to that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are plant waxes and esters and
all the different components of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not like little nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, but they're the building blocks
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to flush out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you pee, do you like,
do you think you pee out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what we're going to flush
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know because I pee out
waste with the building blocks of the food
[SPEAKER_00]: that I ate still created me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My waste comes out, but the things that I
ate and consumed that created me are still
[SPEAKER_00]: here and you're not going to flush a lot
of that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to consume me, you would
only, the waste is all that's coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think even when we flush,
I see that's, and I don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my thought process on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm open to feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your opinions,
your bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to read your paperwork on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have grown for a lot of time and
a lot of environments with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I've had the opportunity to
flush for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we've had emergencies where
plants didn't get to get flushed as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I also noticed that the dry and
cure really had a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is that white ash really telling me
that it was flushed properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the flush the right thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do notice that if we overfeed,
the stuff doesn't burn right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you overfeed certain things,
it doesn't burn right, but is flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: real?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still adjusting my approach to that
whole thought process, but I want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what are we flushing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what do we actually think is coming
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen,
Chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for you for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a quick show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how long we've been going
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quality over quantity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could ramble on and make this show
longer, but we got a quick talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to talk about the discord and stuff
at the top of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening to
