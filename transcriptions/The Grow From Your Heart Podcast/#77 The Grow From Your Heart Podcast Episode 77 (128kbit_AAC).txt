White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good, if I can get through this
intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardest word was today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said that word a lot, so there must
be something going on in my brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some dab on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be, yeah, my brain might be
all sticky from the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is a stony Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are recording on June 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, Maya Luna.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode will come out on Thursday,
June 18th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into a lot of stuff,
I want to read an iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get a lot of iTunes comments on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got to say thanks to Kat and Coop
from the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: The opening song is the doggie dub.

Band and stay positive sound.

he's definitely on top of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for supporting us, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is all of the super important
business we got to take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no advertisements or anything on
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the shout out taken care of for the
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a couple of minutes, actually,
I'm going to tell you what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is going to give us his little not
little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say little because I don't want to
downplay it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is going to give us his great
presentation about getting you into being
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis activist or a lobbyist or just
getting your foot into the door to help us
[SPEAKER_01]: support cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put together a little spiel on the quick
path to step it up and help and fight for
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get to that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This story out of Santa Ana, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm saying that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who is from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Santa Ana, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike tweeted this the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys follow Mike or the show on
Twitter or my personal Twitter and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly my most popular tweet ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of Twitter notifications
because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike is at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am at Rasta Jeff for 20 and the show is
at GFY podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our Twitter started blowing up when
this video came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of the video is Santa Ana Pot
Shop Raid Sparks Investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to play the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I can play this video and
no one's going to get mad at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play it here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to watch it and I'm going to
kind of narrate it and what's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a little like a Doug Benson interruptions
sort of a thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to interrupt this thing
and talk a bunch of shit over it and
[SPEAKER_01]: explain what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts off with I'll just before we
even hit play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts off with a disclaimer and I want
to read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That to you guys, it says the following
video shows a raid by Santa Ana police at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sky High Medical Marijuana Dispensary
on May 27th, 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: The footage has been edited by the
dispensary's attorneys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The text that appears in the portions of
the video also were inserted by the
[SPEAKER_01]: attorneys to explain what they believe was
occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: After reviewing the photo, Santa Ana's
police chief says he plans to investigate
[SPEAKER_01]: the officer's actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to hit play and I may have to
adjust the volume a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got the reggae playing from the
intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to adjust the volume
because it's a YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it gets choppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before you hit play,
man, just a little background for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the city in question here, um,
decided that they were going to ban all
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, uh, at least for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a several that have opened
up, had opened up already or opened up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the face of the ban and continued to
operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not exactly sure what steps were
taken before the video starts playing by
[SPEAKER_00]: the city, but yeah, the video is nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to defend anything in it
just to give you guys a little heads up as
[SPEAKER_00]: to what led up to the video hitting true
starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to hit play now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if the volume is wonky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'll, I'll be on it quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening is that's the
battering ram on the front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, I'm going to hit pause and talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're battering, battering, ramming the
front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're busting in the front door,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hitting it with the battering ram
inward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an outward pulling door.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the dude would have grabbed the handle
and pulled, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unlocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a business that's open for business.
[SPEAKER_01]: The view that we're seeing is coming from
a hidden camera and security cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law enforcement tore down all the
cameras during the raid, but there were
[SPEAKER_01]: hidden cameras in here at the advice of
the attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you own a dispensary, put up some
hidden cameras so that you can catch this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit if it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, all they had to do was pull that
door open and walk in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, they are slam the door at the
battering ram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they finally realize, oh,
we can pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pull the door open and they come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're now rushing in and clearing
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are carrying pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are carrying assault rifles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in body armor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are wearing masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they bust open the door of what would
be the bud room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the noise is just so noisy in here,
but they start yelling, get on the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: ground to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these people are just customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're shopping here and they look a
little confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, wait, we're shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna hit play again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the volumes, the sound is terrible on
this video, but it's just a security camp
[SPEAKER_01]: footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're hearing, get on the fucking
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're throwing everybody on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, these cops got guns on everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cops got masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one cop's got his helmet on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one dude's not wearing a mask or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they're getting everybody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're telling the employees to turn off
the music, turn off that radio because the
[SPEAKER_01]: music is pretty loud in the shop.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it that all the giant guy cops are
in masks and there's like 160 pound female
[SPEAKER_00]: officer and she's not in a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the mask for fellas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She seemed, the masks will come off soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come off when all the cops,
the cameras are destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Mike can't see the screen right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he doesn't know what's going on,
but he's seen the video enough times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, now they are escorting a lady out who
is in a wheelchair who I found out later
[SPEAKER_01]: after the video was posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is blind and in a wheelchair and
they're just making them follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has one leg and she, and yeah,
she's just at the shop as a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what, here's what they had to say
about the lady with the amputated leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make sure you guys can hear
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what the cops are saying about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got some sound equipment trying
to process it to make it sound better
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is maybe a 50 or 60 year old
woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one cop asked, did you punch that
old Bonita?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lady cop replied, I was about to
kick her in her fucking nub.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the people that we pay to
protect and serve us.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the people that think they're
doing us a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the land of the free and the home of
the brave.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people that are serving and
protecting the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're talking about, did you punch
that old Bonita?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a 60 year old woman in a
wheelchair with one leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: A handicapped lady.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, what law enforcement action would
require you to ever physically assault a
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 year old woman in a wheelchair?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why would she want to kick her in her
fucking nub?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not any sort of law enforcement
tactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure if we look up any law
enforcement manual, kick her in her
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking nub is not in there ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit play again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find more bullshit in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it just gets worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep repeating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, they just keep playing it from
different angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the next part is the officers
climbing up onto the display cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, now first he's trying to pull it down
with like his crowbar swinging at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras on the ceiling with a crowbar and
stuff, just smashing security equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't want what's about to
take place to be recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't realize that they were on
a hidden camera, which is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy looked right into it one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't realize it was a hidden
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the dispensary had two layers of
cameras, so cops completely missed layer
[SPEAKER_00]: number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice looking shop too, wherever
this place was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had several jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a well set up place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a nice looking menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's painted well, nice hardwood floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like a good shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lobby doesn't look totally different
from the one I work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the spot dispensary while
this video plays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cops are now tearing down the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a seven minute video, guys,
and we're probably going to watch the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the cops are in the offices,
climbing up on top of the desks and the
[SPEAKER_01]: saves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and now they've got bolt cutters and
then cut the wires on all the shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: they pull the TV down and just start
cutting wires and they're watching the
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor to see where the cameras are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're sending the dudes to go cut
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's in like full on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks like fucking G.I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in full on SWAT gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a mask on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got more guns than you need for a
fucking army.
[SPEAKER_01]: These dudes went into a dispensary where
people were shopping and doing business
[SPEAKER_01]: like and raided them like fucking SWAT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't there a crack house or somewhere
that needed to be raided?
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the video, all the
furniture has been smashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desks are flipped over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The display cases are all broken open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're carrying out the DVRs as evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now here's where the video gets funny,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they think they've broken all the
cameras and disconnected the DVR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't think anybody can see them
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now all the masks come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, nobody is masked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are opening each jar and smelling the
jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the officers has the buds pressed
up against his face, just like you or I
[SPEAKER_01]: would do it and smelling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got to turn it down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the officers, that's one
officer asking another for one edible,
[SPEAKER_00]: please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the guys are I'm going to pause
it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Officer that I don't know his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's wearing a white shirt with green
sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a shave.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a shaved head, a beard and a
mustache.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just unwrapped a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot tell you that it was certainly an
edible infused with cannabis, but his
[SPEAKER_01]: friend just said one edible, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he unwrapped this food product and put
it directly into his mouth and offered the
[SPEAKER_01]: second half to his other buddy who is
wearing fucking cop uniform, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: green pants, greenish gray pants,
black police shirt and a bald fucking head
[SPEAKER_01]: and some sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of kind of muscular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Handed the other part to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if he eats that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part cut away, the video cut away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lawyers edited it kind of funny,
but they just showed this fucking cop
[SPEAKER_01]: that's raiding the dispensary,
eating the edibles from the dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: that he's raiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that uphold the law?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that justice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does theory?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these officers are on duty and
they're consuming edibles and they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all high five in and having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them starts playing darts at one
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're just hanging out,
throwing darts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that ate the edible doesn't show
any signs of being high right now yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't know how much time has passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just sitting around playing
darts, texting each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who they're texting,
but they're all texting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got their phones out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just dicking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all on the clock laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear the giggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I've mostly proven my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, these cops raided a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were complete disrespectful cunts to
handicap people, a lady in a wheelchair,
[SPEAKER_01]: a blind lady, medical marijuana patients,
regular customers, employees of this
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They belittled all these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They disrespected these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They violated their civil rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they come in and destroy this place's
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably cost them so much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The store looks like shit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful when they started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then to add insult to fucking injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are the people that we pay to
protect us, to keep us safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came in and they basically robbed
this place because now they're eating the
[SPEAKER_01]: product that they were supposed to destroy
on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're munching them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like laughing in our faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, this other cop is full on just
unwrapped an edible and is grubbing it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sitting at the counter, grubbing it,
reading the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, carrying it around with them and
just munching on it like it's fucking a
[SPEAKER_01]: banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they just went balls in like that and
ate these edibles and didn't get stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: high, they're pot consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're regular consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular, regular consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much disturbing behavior packed
into such a short video.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just munching it and you give a
thumbs up to somebody like, this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're bagging shit up to take home,
it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming that that's about what's
about to happen, but I can't promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my presumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put something in a bag and he's walking
off a camera with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't look like an evidence bag to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was a bag from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks like a checkout bag that I
fill all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's ridiculous, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to keep you updated on what
happens with the Santa Ana police after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely going to be some sort
of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an investigation going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor has made public comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blowing up, so find the video people
and share it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everybody sees it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how often do you hear,
hey, it's practically legal in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get your medical card, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in that shop had a medical card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they just sent the customers
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago, Mike and I, I was the
manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the keys, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to run the only dispensary in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much my shop for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mike was my backup budtender
because I couldn't handle it all by
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working fucking 12 hour days,
six days a week and killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got Mike in there to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day they decided to come in
and close us while we had customers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to prove a point, Mike, do you want
to tell us how they chose to come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: close our medical marijuana dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just a regular random
police officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the city manager at the time
walked up to the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knocked on the door, security let them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked to speak to a manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager walked up and asked,
you know, hi, what can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, hi, we're from the city of
Pueblo and we've got to deliver this
[SPEAKER_00]: letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they turned around and left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The letter said, uh, we haven't passed
regulations for dispensaries yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wanted to kick any old Benita.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing was smashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have to break out the SWAT
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody needed to protect their identity
while they destroyed property in a random
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't need to feel intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't need to waste 12 officers
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't need to fuck up our days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came in and said, you guys are fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walked in and said, you're fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to find a new job soon is what
they all walked in and said.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they didn't raid or smash or steal
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's no, absolutely no need
for this on behalf of the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got dispensaries 10 miles
away, every direction, but not in our
[SPEAKER_01]: city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good move there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Santa Ana, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see how this turns out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let these cops get away with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys, if you sent them there to take
down this dispensary because cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: federally illegal by eating the evidence
there, they definitely committed a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had done that, if you caught me
destroying evidence on camera,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part of the video that really pissed
me off and I knew I had to share it like
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere I possibly could was right at
the end of the video, the fire department
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up and one of the cops shouts nice
and loud and clear for the microphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fires here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody watch your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the police department and the fire
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're essentially the like Batman and
fucking Robin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would the fire department seeing and
hearing the police doing doing police work
[SPEAKER_00]: or business be a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would they have to watch their mouth
around the fire department?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it because you're stealing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because you're eating edibles on the
job?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't drink on the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you can't consume cannabis
on the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a, if you're a cop raiding a
place, you shouldn't be consuming anything
[SPEAKER_01]: from there because then you're a
Hippocratic prick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it's theft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but then you're also a prick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I punched, if I was like,
Mike, you're an asshole because you smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to turn you into the police and
you're like, dude, you just took four dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Hippocratic prick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a definite Hippocrat for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these cops that are going in and
ruining people's lives and then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, well, I'm going to take some of
the product that I just ruined your life
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a fucking piece of shit person
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it doesn't matter what they're
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take or eat anything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I mean, no one's been convicted of a
crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're just destroying stuff for
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stealing for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting there eating infused
cannabis, fucking candy on the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when a call comes in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the bank up the streets getting
robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a cop on a fucking decadent
cheeba-choo stone went through the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: streets in full body armor with a
semi-automatic assault rifle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the last thing anyone needs is
a bunch of cops on edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got almost 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 20 minutes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike put together some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been asking him to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get more people involved in
cannabis activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video is a nice little spark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting involved and you've
kept your head down to this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is in California where weeds
basically legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're arresting people, threatening to
kick an old woman in a wheelchair because
[SPEAKER_00]: she didn't hustle the fuck up fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just absolutely ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs to say enough is enough
and stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're about to tell you how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my good buddy, Mike, and he's
going to help you guys learn how to stand
[SPEAKER_01]: up for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need another drink, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you over there shaking your half
empty bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a water or one of these cans?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, all right, Sue, it's time to stand
up and get involved folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, first thing I would say is
figure out what about cannabis you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you love how it relaxes you at the end
of the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you love getting nice and high and
playing video games?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like the social aspect of sitting
in a circle with your friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: passing a joint and talking about
whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you enjoy different medical aspects of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it ease your pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it stop your seizures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it allow you to eat through the
nausea of whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is it helping fight your cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's got you really passionate about
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sparks that, that fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're going to need some fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause some of this gets really dull.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you have a sick family member
that you need to fight for because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: About I have a sick friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: What product should I point them towards?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have people asking me about their
pain all day or their ailments and what
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis might do for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of people out there
that know it's about a lot more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if it's just about getting high
for you, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans have enjoyed intoxicants since
before we had like a society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even little kids spin around in
circles to break free of reality for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just something humans like in
cannabis is great for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the safest intoxicant known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other intoxicant causes a lot of
harm to your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds have been looking for a long time
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start doing your research,
you're going to learn that as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicants go, I mean, even just beer and
alcohol cannabis is far, far safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just prefer it over alcohol,
that's still a great reason to stand up
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, Hey, we need to legalize this in
my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be super sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab because Mike's got
a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't get so hard on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got that spark lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what really turns you on about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to start getting educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to start learning a couple of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, start researching cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a long and interesting history.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in time, the medical
research and the research on safety for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, even if you're smoking big
old fat joints all the time, vaporizers
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot healthier way to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to skip that burning plant
material, but even if you're puffing Jays
[SPEAKER_00]: old school, you're not doing the kind of
damage to your body that tobacco smoker
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a one-to-one comparison folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get online and start learning everything
you can about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to sit down and do it all
at once, but I mean, if you love cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning a lot about it and knowing that
you're not killing yourself because you
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it, that's something that everybody
should want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you're learning about cannabis,
start learning about the laws in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the United States,
the internet, every local government,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of how small a town or area you
live in, everything's online at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out when the meetings are happening,
how that government's structured,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a city council or if it's a board
of county commissioners or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out when they meet and just start
going to meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit in the back and just observe how they
play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I laugh a lot about
the anti-pot groups down here never did
[SPEAKER_00]: this step.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just started showing up to meetings
and shouting shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you don't know how the meetings
function, you don't know where to put your
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like, I don't know,
an idiot showing up the first day on the
[SPEAKER_00]: job and just tackling random things in the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not helpful no matter how much
energy or passion you're throwing into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take a couple of really long
boring nights, these meetings can go for
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three hours at a stand and just see
how they flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them allow democratic
participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any member of the public can show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they follow a couple of really
simple, easy rules like sign up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: speak during the appropriate time of the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really simple shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get up and say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're not cussing at somebody
or screaming and yelling at somebody on
[SPEAKER_00]: council, they'll let you rant about
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you five full minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get five minutes at the beginning of
every meeting down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow six people to sign up every
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can rant about whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, it's these three
old guys that just show up and bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, sometimes nobody signs
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone on council down here has thanked
me for breaking up the tedium of the
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of people that speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't all agree with me, but they
appreciate me going and saying something
[SPEAKER_00]: coherent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're down to hear whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that have come and spoke
out about roadside memorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever issue interests you,
you can go down and speak about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your issue is cannabis, you can show
up to your local town council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've done your homework a little
bit, you can point out how many millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars they could make if cannabis was
legal in their area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the time to pull the data
coming out of Colorado and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state, it's been 18 months since
recreational stores were open their doors
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to prove just how safe cannabis
legalization is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have stores that adults 21 years
of age or older can walk into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you throw the shit and well-labeled
child proof packaging, it's perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no harm caused.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no increase in any DUIs or teen
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so much cannabis out there
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stores do is change who profits
from the sale and where a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: adults choose to go to buy their weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization isn't a huge earth shattering
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the end of a lot of stupidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we've been keeping tally of
the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been watching very closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was supposed to be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the predictions a year or two ago
are laughable now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local paper, the chieftain does a shit
job regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In miracle of miracles, they did an
amazing expose on what legal marijuana did
[SPEAKER_00]: to our county.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold 17 million dollars worth of
marijuana and the cops can't point to a
[SPEAKER_00]: firm problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: $17 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only 150,000 people down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the black market died.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a huge number of people prefer
going to the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying weed on the black market can be a
nightmare, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're so spoiled in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to think back to what it
used to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but a lot of people have a hardcore
dealer that they've got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They operate under dealer rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you meet in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quick exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bag's light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got other crap in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never the strain they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops looking to arrest you for doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some friends in from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like friends of a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: My good friend had family in from
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, we went to the
dispensary over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, you went there and
paid like, and they're like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted to go to that place because
they heard a lot about it and wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what it was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just wanted the experience of going
through the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting off track now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the laws in your area, how the
public meetings work, and when and how
[SPEAKER_00]: public comment is taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look up other legalization groups
in your area, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a ton of groups out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1970s, we were really close to
marijuana being legal, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that fell apart, a number of
groups started forming nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: NORML is the big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with NORML,
you really, really need to start Googling
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the Marijuana Policy Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing national lobbying for
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've helped write a number of the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they helped with Colorado's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They helped with Alaska's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've written a number of other medical
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a really big organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students for a Sensible Drug policies on
pretty much every college campus in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ex-cops, ex-DEA agents,
judges, lawyers that, through experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: have learned just how pointless marijuana
prohibition is and have begun calling for
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a great group, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow them on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of their YouTube videos are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning, okay, so I'm going to start
going out and speaking for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I just go to city council and go,
free weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull up LEAP's videos on YouTube,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy, Peter Christ, is his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull him up on YouTube and just watch him
destroy the idea of prohibition in 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great place to start, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last organization I'd say
everybody needs to check out is a group
[SPEAKER_00]: called Flex Your Rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go and start speaking
up about marijuana legalization in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's not already medically legal or
there's not a number of other people doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that, it can be terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that's really going
to help you feel a lot more secure in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that is knowing what your rights are
as a citizen in the good old United States
[SPEAKER_00]: of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flex Your Rights is an organization of
defense attorneys that have put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of great videos and little training
webpages on flexing your rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: What rights do you have when the cop
pounds on your door and says, open up,
[SPEAKER_00]: police?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should all watch that anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should watch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone that's listening right now should
pull up these videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your rights when you get pulled
over during a traffic stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you get on YouTube and watch
some of the same shit I do, you've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: people refuse to roll their window down
and just hand or put up IDs to the window
[SPEAKER_00]: and completely refuse what the cops are
saying and just do something different and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cops all look befuddled and then the
important cop walks over, tells the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cops they don't get to smash the window
and they don't get to ruin this guy's
[SPEAKER_00]: night and the guy's free to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to do that legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's terrifying to stand up in
front of the police chief because the
[SPEAKER_00]: police chiefs at a lot of these meetings,
the city councils at these meetings,
[SPEAKER_00]: the city attorney, everyone's in a suit
and tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cameras rolling and you're going
to stand up and encourage them to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to push for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know your rights and you've
paid attention in the meetings and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how they flow and you make your
argument at the appropriate time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate way, they're going to hear
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be impressed and they're
going to want to know more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you've done your homework and
you're educated, when they come up to you
[SPEAKER_00]: after the meeting and go, I like what you
said, can we sit down later?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear about what pot legalization
might do for our little town here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to lunch later and really
explain, okay, in Colorado, towns this
[SPEAKER_00]: size that allowed this many shops,
made this much in tax revenue,
[SPEAKER_00]: this much in application fees,
they spent this much in enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're able to spend an extra this
much on their roads this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make that argument to someone in
local government, they're going to just be
[SPEAKER_00]: astounded at the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to look at this
issue in a new way.
[SPEAKER_01]: $17 million is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo is a poor town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like half the people down here are on some
form of assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually like 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The median income down here is like 14
grand a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jeff just looked at me a little
horrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little shocked too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's a big city full of a lot of
people in hard times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this industry has been huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jobs, the local investment in the
city, hop on the chieftain, if you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the chieftain.com and scroll all the way
down to the bottom of the page on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right-hand side, they've got a couple of
big expose they've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is called the growing
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I suppose you could just Google the
chieftain, the growing trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings up a big series of reports and
they break down what the police had to say
[SPEAKER_00]: after the county sold $17 million in pot
last year, what the teachers had to say
[SPEAKER_00]: and the principals, what the fire
department had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tallied up what the county spent on
enforcement and going out and making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you met zoning and that you were
checking IDs and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They added up everything they could think
of that was related to legal pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tallied it in one column and it
was like 220 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pulled in 1.7 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a million and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge return on a small investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all they had to do was get out of
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think that we're bringing more
people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know we're bringing people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's seeing a flood of people come
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the gold rushes before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just moving, but visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming to just to come buy a bag
of weed and go on a hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of people coming to visit and
checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm hoping they all take home is
when they get home, they need to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone they know how sane and rational
this decision was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people are shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, you're going to add another
legal intoxicant to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be terrible for society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, marijuana's never killed anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol kills almost 100,000 people a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's before the car crashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco kills almost half a million people
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from getting diseases from
using and dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police kill more people than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 already this year, just because I know
that's that off the top of my head.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peanuts kill more people than cannabis
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightning kills 52 Americans a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to look that shit up recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting off track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going, dude, because you got quite a
bit of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure you get this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've started attending meetings and
figuring out how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to start speaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the terrifying part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's easy to sit at home and Google,
does cannabis cure cancer and then read
[SPEAKER_00]: what Dr. Tashkin has to say about that or
to Google the history of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: spend the night reading about how the
federal government's run a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana program every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've fucking been alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, they mail people 11 ounces of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck did you not know about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to follow you home from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going down to city council and
standing up at the podium and swearing and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving your name and address and then
speaking out for legalization can be
[SPEAKER_00]: scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it right, you're going to
see succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to follow you home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's even like an extra layer of
protection because if the cops are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to screw with the person that's going to
city council and making a stink,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do the cops want press?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to bring, you know,
the district attorney and the cops do not
[SPEAKER_01]: need any press right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they pretty much leave you alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had an issue and I've been
doing this for like six years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you got to do is figure out what
you want to say and how you want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about medical access?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about full blown
legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a few minutes and really pen out what
you want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a couple of bullet point notes of
points you want to hit and then practice
[SPEAKER_00]: it a couple of times at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself familiar with it because it
can be really nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate public speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nervous sitting here on the podcast
and I love it in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get shaky the first time,
but I hear a lot of people get shaky and
[SPEAKER_01]: city council knows they look at you like
it's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're struggling, they'll even
like, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get in trouble here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they try to reassure you a little
bit, even if they disagree with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they see that you're nervous,
they're really nice about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, but, uh, plan out what you want
to say, practice it a couple of times at
[SPEAKER_00]: home and then go down to the meeting or,
uh, just throw on clean clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the key people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to dress way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in jeans and a button down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take off your hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got dreads time back,
neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big beard, maybe clean it
up a little bit, but just clean clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go buy a suit or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, there are some guys that come in
there looking like they just, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: wearing their work uniform and they're
like, Hey, I'm part of this union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, Oh, I could tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, and we feel this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that shows that they're a
working fucking man and that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking about what they've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're coming straight from work,
it's perfectly appropriate to show up and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you were wearing at work that
day, people do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause most of these meetings are like six
o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much when everybody's
headed home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a normal job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just throw on something clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get yourself cleaned up a
little bit, practice what you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, then go down, sign up and say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, throw on a clean shirt,
go down and go down, sign up and speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start off with good evening
council.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think going like gentlemen and lady
makes you sound like a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's, you know, men and women on
the council, you can just skip all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsense with good evening council or good
evening board of county commissioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use their formal title and then say
what you've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, try to say thank you
for, uh, thank you for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving me this chance to speak tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really appreciate it when people
thank them and then hang out at the
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the part that everyone,
regardless of their issue skips the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go speak at the meeting nine times out
of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when the, the section of time where
the public can speak is over, everyone in
[SPEAKER_00]: the meeting shuffles out the city council
down here, even pauses for a minute to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the very next step of the meeting is
council commentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where they sit in banter back and
forth for a few minutes about what they
[SPEAKER_00]: just heard and about other shit that's
come up that week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the important part of the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're arguing with them about
anything, knowing the issues city council
[SPEAKER_00]: cares about, knowing the different
projects they're working on in the city,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing out of the hundreds of emails they
get each week, which one or two they
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to bring up at city council,
as though it's a folksy fucking antidote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like knowing that stuff helps you
structure your argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll help you figure out which one
of those council members is on your side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of buddy up with them,
especially after you've spoken because
[SPEAKER_00]: they frequently discuss what they heard
that night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you how many times I've
heard, I wish the person who spoke earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: was still in this room because we'd like
to thank him for coming and speaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when we know it's tough to
do and da da da da, the last one was this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this really sweet kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept stopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I heard him talking before the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have a stammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fully had a stammer while he was
testifying and he was talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: homeless problem down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he left immediately after he
spoke and the council spent maybe 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes debating the issue and gathering
city research or asking the city manager
[SPEAKER_00]: about resources to help the kid with his
issue or to address some of the issues the
[SPEAKER_00]: kid brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would have been great if he was
there for that, but he was already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was gone and I doubt he'll pull it up
online later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've been there when they've called
upon you to answer a cannabis question.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, Michael, are you here?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one guy's like that guy over there
knows, let him speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just stand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, the answer is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people look at you like you're a
fucking robot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So become, you guys can all become that
guy for council and don't expect it to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching Mike do this for
probably eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first go at best, you're the
articulate guy talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth time you go and speak,
you're the really articulate guy who comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to meetings and knows what he's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, he really seems to know,
you know, he's presenting an argument in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that a lot of people are really
started to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the first year or so you're the
person they think of when that issue comes
[SPEAKER_00]: up, I should get a hold of that guy and
ask him what his take on this issue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get two or three calls a week from
reporters down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some, sometimes fact checking a story
they're doing, sometimes asking for my
[SPEAKER_00]: take on an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm forever running to the news or run
to the newsstand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab a paper, like it's just something
that comes up after you start doing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we'll be in the car and both of our
phones will ring and it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: reporter texting his both like,
do you know someone who can blank and we
[SPEAKER_00]: both look at each other and chuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the answer to this odd cannabis
question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the car with Mike and city
council members have called him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, turn down the music,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got the reggae full blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, um, this is a council
member.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to turn that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meetings are real formal and there's,
it's so procedural and there's police
[SPEAKER_00]: officers and the heads of the city or the
town or whatever there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems really rigid and kind of
terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've gone a few times,
you see that it's just bored politicians
[SPEAKER_00]: who desperately want someone else to give
a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're super happy to have anyone
come down to the meetings and be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people that are there are paid to
be there or people that are asking for
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start showing up is the guy
saying, I've done my homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured out the marijuana legalization
could save our county a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars and make our county $200,000 on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 300 grand total.
[SPEAKER_00]: They freaked the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else goes, here's my issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need 35 grand or even 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The youth center needs another $3,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: The working thing needs this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you show up and say, I found a way
for you to make a huge amount of money or
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to bring a whole bunch of jobs to
our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you tell your argument,
well, you can really hit these people in
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that they're going to go home
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is giving you guys like 12 good
points to make the tax money that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in the jobs that it's going to
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has already gotten you guys a bunch
of head starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 10 years ago when I was studying
this stuff in college, it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could guess what legalization might do
to an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could look at Amsterdam and kind of
guesstimate what that would look like in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, but it's been 15 years since our
medical marijuana laws passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008 was the dispensary explosion with the
medical marijuana heyday that we always
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the data that's been collected all
that time, the cops were sure this was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lead to the apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rehab industry was sure this was going
to lead to the apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government was sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody was keeping records.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Revenue in Colorado,
you can go on their website and look,
[SPEAKER_00]: pull the tax numbers by county,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what the 1% kickback that the
generating area gets from the state adds
[SPEAKER_00]: up to for every little town that allows
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can pull those numbers wherever
you are on the planet now and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: our little town has over 40,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the math, and we can make this
much or save this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make this much, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll cost you a little, but I mean,
over a year's time, you're going to...
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made $17 million here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not experimenting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just looking at the reality and
choosing the course that makes the most
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone just over 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be done in 14 minutes at the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty much done, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have questions about getting
involved or need help finding something
[SPEAKER_00]: research wise, feel free to tweet me or
feel free to shoot the podcast in email,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll get those answered on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'd love to... We love the
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we skipped something, if there's
something else that you need more details
[SPEAKER_01]: on, get it Mike, get it myself,
get it the show, we'll answer it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically... Go ahead, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got something else to go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start Googling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find the answer with two or
three Google questions, send me a tweet,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll teach you how to Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll definitely help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All human information is on the internet
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to ask Google correctly and
it will bring it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I saw it coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leap, that's law enforcement against
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter Christ will show you how to keep
yourself out of trouble and flexyourrights
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Flexyourrights.com?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, flexyourrights.com, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just Google flexyourrights,
it'll come right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, check out that because then you can
learn how to protect yourself in an
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an upcoming episode, we're going to
watch a video of some cops smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're retired police officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen the video yet, but we're
definitely going to watch that here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have coming up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Clint is going to be on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when Clint's on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and I went to see... Him and I and a
few other friends actually went to see
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug Benson on 420 and Doug recorded a
comedy album on 420 and the album is now
[SPEAKER_01]: out and Clint and I both downloaded it and
we have listened to it and we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: review the album here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to get Clint's stupid
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think is going to happen on
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be here for his first dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Clint will ever take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, we're going to start
wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get too far, I want to give a big
shout out to my homie Deez.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other day I played a really dancey
electronic song at the end of the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was from my buddy Deez.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to play that one again here at
the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a note to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, huge, huge shout outs to Sonny,
Reve and Arnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Sonny threw a party Saturday
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: He invited me to come play some drums with
kind of a band that we had never met
[SPEAKER_01]: before and we put a band together that
night and we played a bunch of songs for a
[SPEAKER_01]: few hours and we killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Sonny for the invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Reve and Arnie for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to doing that again in the
very near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to The Spot Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, big old shout out for coming on the
show and teaching people how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we've needed for a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been looking forward to doing
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't go too fast for y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to tweet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at demopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can direct message about whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can help you get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent like 10 years passionately
researching cannabis, the history,
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical effects, all that,
so I'm happy to point you in whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: direction you're looking to get informed
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, just hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows a lot of shit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a real narrow scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows kind of a broad scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's any at all weed or social policy
related, I have researched living shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and I'm happy to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for helping us, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thanks for listening to another
episode.

going to be episode 78 Monday.
