[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 460 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of downshift
live batter from our friends at Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of southbound and HSB,
which is Han Solo Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label describes the flavor as gas,
earth, and hazelnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely get the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely get the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure that I tasted hazelnut,
although it was extremely delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this
concentrate contains 67.99% THC and zero
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the flavor, and I really
like the great eye buzz and the face buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: from the downshift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack this open so we can
take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consistency is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I've got a piece of really
soft cheese or maybe a nice golden colored
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk of cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I still don't get the hazelnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a hint of lavender or
something in there, but I'm not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hazelnut out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor, and I love the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious and amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: downshift live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the fun stuff
I've gotten to do recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of weeks ago, my friend Clint and
I got to go see Joe Rogan at the Belko
[SPEAKER_00]: Theater in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time riding up with Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is not a heavy cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have parked the car and safely taken
a dab before we went into the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Clint may have gotten a little
extra buzzed off my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to the event way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't exactly sure where the theater
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea how long it was going to
take me to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive about 130 miles for these shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it could take us two hours to
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it can take three and a half
hours to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave plenty early.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were there quite early.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to go find the Belko Theater and
we discovered that the Belko Theater is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually inside of the Denver Convention
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denver Convention Center is about the
size of two city blocks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you live in a small or normal city,
that is probably three or four blocks and
[SPEAKER_00]: it is one building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a gigantic, tremendous building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different halls inside
of this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hold multiple different concerts
and conventions and events inside of this
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I showed up quite early.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were not a lot of people in the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically had free range of this giant
convention center to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were a little bit baked and we just
walked around and checked out some areas
[SPEAKER_00]: had really great artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one area, they had a bunch of license
plates pinned to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some areas had great artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places it looked like a shitty old
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a bunch of weird hallways that
just connected weird, unnecessary hallways
[SPEAKER_00]: that connected areas to areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really fun walking around this
giant building where there were no other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a couple of security guards
would come out of nowhere and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: follow us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would stay back and not bother us,
but you could tell they were keeping an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye on us, making sure we weren't doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not threatening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just bored, killing time,
a little bit baked, laughing about the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one area where I said it looked
like a scene from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were just skate lines everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go down the rail there,
go up the rail there, go across the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: there, go over there, come back down that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really an interesting
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carpet was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place was gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were convention halls and there were
full food courts inside of this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a giant mall with a giant
building with a giant building inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, eventually it was time to go see
Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We headed toward the area where we thought
Joe Rogan was performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go through a little security
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run you through a metal detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not care if you had a vape pen on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people were inside of the show
smoking out of a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't realize that once we got past
that security area, we had to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: another line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're thinking, where is this
theater?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it might be in this little
section of this building in which we are
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get past the security line and
past another line, they check our tickets
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go in, there was another complete
5,000 capacity theater hidden in the small
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom corner of this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing to walk into this door and
realize, holy shit, there is a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: theater in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a sign right there by the door
as I walked in and it said, capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,005 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theater itself was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how big the building itself had to
be if there was a 5,000 person venue just
[SPEAKER_00]: gently tucked into one small corner of the
enormous multiple city block building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a giant place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really cool theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were plenty of concessions,
so you didn't have to stand in line to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a drink or to get a snack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, neither Clint or I drink alcohol,
so we just jump in line and get a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were politely escorted to our seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had very nice seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do very well when I buy comedy show
tickets and concert tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be down in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see the action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got down in the front there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see several good comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an opener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot think of her name right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do her the respect of pressing
pause and finding her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the great comedian who opened
for Mr. Joe Rogan, her name was Allie
[SPEAKER_00]: Makovsky, and she was fucking hilarious,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I wanted to take a moment and
find out her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: She deserves some respect and some
promotion, so if you are a comedy fan and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have not found out about Allie
Makovsky, now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give her a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms. Allie Makovsky comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her microphone could have been a little
bit louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I think she did a really
good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that happens when you do
comedy in a giant theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell the joke and the people in the
front row hear you, and then the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle hear you, and then the people
in the back hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laughter goes toward the back,
but then it's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits the back and it moves back toward
the front, and then it goes up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: balcony, and then it moves out,
and then it comes back around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it takes a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the laughter to stop in a big theater
like that, that's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laughter is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when a comedian gets a big
laugh, but it messes up the timing of
[SPEAKER_00]: telling a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, you could say, I don't even have
a good joke in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock, knock, who's there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Punch line, the laughter, and then you go,
ha ha, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next line to keep the laughter going,
that's called the tag line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a big theater, you have to say,
knock, knock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wait a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say, who's there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say the answer, ha ha ha,
and then everybody laughs for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to throw in another tag line
to stick it and make it laugh a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: harder, you really have to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let all that big rumble of laughter
subside so that you've got the audience's
[SPEAKER_00]: attention again, and they don't have to
hear you over that laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to throw on another tag,
you really have to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changes the dynamic of comedy in a
big theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Ali is learning how to manage
a large crowd like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't quite patient enough on some of
the jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could have let the laughter go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have laughed a little longer,
and a little harder had she given us the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something she needs to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, her material was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her approach, her delivery was all
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just needs to adjust to the size of
that club.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very young and very new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's her only problem, she is going
to be a fantastic comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys check out Ali Makovsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did enjoy her comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next comedian that took the stage
really blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I have fallen in love with a
podcast called Whiskey Ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been paying attention to everything
that this comedian does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited when Ali wrapped up
her set.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, ladies and gentlemen,
this next comedian is the host of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiskey Ginger podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to bring to the stage,
Andrew Santino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fucking excited to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I knew that Santino was going to
be the middle act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I remember Rogan saying something
about it on the podcast, or maybe Santino
[SPEAKER_00]: said something about it on one of the many
podcasts he's been on, but I had forgotten
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so distracted by the day and just
the excitement of going to Denver and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing Rogan that I think it totally
slipped my mind that Santino would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really thought that it was going to be
Ian Edwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was excited to see Ian Edwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're not a Ian Edwards fan
and you don't know who Ian Edwards is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a comedy special coming out very
soon if it's not out already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely recommend you check out Ian
Edwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't slip on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited to find out that
Santino was the middle act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Santino is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call him Cheeto because he's a
ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got bright orange hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not do too many jokes capitalizing
on his gingerness, which I think is really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's cheap when a comedian uses
one physical feature and focuses too much
[SPEAKER_00]: on that for their comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said that if I did stand up
comedy, I would not do weed humor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think would be really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be too direct if I went up on
stage and told a bunch of pot jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just way too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too cliche.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to make a better approach,
more effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do something original if I did
comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm getting off track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really loved Santino's comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He opened up, started talking about
potheads and how he hates potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, fuck Sublime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sublime is the worst band on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was really fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: On his podcast recently, he did a really
long rant about fuck white people with
[SPEAKER_00]: dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you guys know I am a white
people with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white guy with dreadlocks to my
fucking knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get offended when people say fuck
white people with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have dreadlocks and be offended
by people who don't like dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of having dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like me because I've got
dreadlocks, that makes it easier because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to have fake friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, Santino was joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: His job is to make jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laughed a lot at his shit talking about
white people with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, most of it was fucking accurate,
so I couldn't even be mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the jokes people make about white
people with dreadlocks are fucking true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be offended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you get offended by comedy,
you're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went to a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's telling a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job is to laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a Ted talk and get offended,
that is totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an educational thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be offended there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy, shut the fuck up and laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is after I heard
Santino do his 30 minute rant on his
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast about fuck white people with
dreadlocks, he wrapped it all up by
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, you guys, you know, I'm a
comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love white people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with dreadlocks don't take it
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already knew that, but he had to wrap it
up just for the people that don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hilariously tweeted Santino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Hey, Andrew, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgive you for the things you said
about white people with dreadlocks in
[SPEAKER_00]: today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was telling his joke about fuck
sublime, fuck potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sublime is the worst band ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he looked over toward me and I
think he may have been thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: ranting about white people with
dreadlocks, but he looked to me and just
[SPEAKER_00]: smiled and nodded his head and took a
drink of his drink and changed directions
[SPEAKER_00]: in his comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really funny that he came out
immediately and ranted about fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, potheads are fucking annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you can smoke pot and not be
annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was really funny because I'm
a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to admit, some of us are
fucking annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Santino was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have never seen Andrew Santino
do stand up comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Santino is about to start
doing a TV show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been saying that he's going to be
busy for several months.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to take a break from comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a great honor and a great
privilege to see Andrew Chito Santino do
[SPEAKER_00]: live standup comedy in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was nicely baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know what happened next.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought out one of the funniest
motherfuckers on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Joe fucking Rogan came out and
destroyed that fucking theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laughed until my stomach hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laughed until my cheeks hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face felt weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you laugh a lot, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I get a little weird headache at
the top of my head if I laugh too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laughed until I felt fucking strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only part that sucked, there was some
asshole to the back right of Clint and I
[SPEAKER_00]: who had a response for everything Rogan
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Rogan said, I like cake, that guy would
say brownies are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Rogan said, what's up you bad
motherfuckers, he would say, I'm right
[SPEAKER_00]: here motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I think somebody had to have
said something to him because he stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: He totally went silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think either security or other audience
members were like, shut the fuck up,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, because it was getting obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only real complaint about that theater
is the sound is too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to turn it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a very fine line with standup
comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep the volume at a certain
level because if you turn it up too loud,
[SPEAKER_00]: it encourages people to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thing that happens when the
comedian is loud enough to where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hear him over me chattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel comfortable chattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you turn it down to where I can't
chatter over it to where you hear me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes me uncomfortable to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I shut the fuck up and let the comedian
do his job.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a thing where the comedians
are stoned and they're talking with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of passion and the microphone goes far
from their face and the microphone comes
[SPEAKER_00]: close to their face and it goes far from
their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can't hear some of the
little things they say when it's down
[SPEAKER_00]: quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bothered me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to listen too closely to hear
everything that Rogan said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish they would have turned the
volume up just a little tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I was in the very front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the sound from the sound system
was going right over my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't even getting the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was mostly getting the sound that came
from Rogan's mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the crowd got cheering or
laughing, sometimes you would get drowned
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little bit frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ninety nine percent of the time I
could hear what was going on and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogan started out by apologizing to any of
the women who were in the crowd who were
[SPEAKER_00]: dragged there by their stupid husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who listened to the fucking podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was hilarious because
honestly, that was a third of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sausage fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mostly bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the women that were there looked like
fucking he drug me to this fucking comedy
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to listen to him all the time in
the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to him in the garage and I'm
fucking here watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was exactly the joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what those women looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ali was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheeto Santino is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Joe Rogan blew the goddamn roof
off the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me laugh my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I saw Rogan in
person without a hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Joe Rogan several times do
comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That time he did not have a hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen him do without a hat before,
but I was a little further back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That man is shaped like a damn troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is as wide as he is tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's five feet tall and I think
he's five feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is pure muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't checking him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell he's nothing but fucking
muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude is so ripped and so buff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wears a nice collared shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks nice on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's wearing jeans that are I think
they're stretchy jeans because his thighs
[SPEAKER_00]: are fucking wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wider than both of my legs,
but he's wearing stretchy jeans and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing a nice button up shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's baby blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks real good on him, but he can't
fucking button the sleeves because his
[SPEAKER_00]: wrists are so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this dude is shaped like a goddamn
troll, but Joe Rogan killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got sweaty as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He drools a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty funny to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to see that on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to see the drool and you get
to watch him catch a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like watching the comedians come
out mostly sober and they drink a little
[SPEAKER_00]: whiskey throughout the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end they're like, I'm fucking
rowdy and drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed seeing that from Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go with my buddy Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Clint is such a great road dog for
comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint shows up on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint brings his own cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint brings his own snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint offers gas money.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we stopped at the gas station and
stopped to get snacks, Clint bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: snacks and drinks because I drove and
bought the tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint doesn't need to stop and take extra
pisses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint has no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We walked around Denver and had a good ass
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint didn't need a sweater.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't wear shoes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt his feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint was a bad motherfucker to go to a
comedy show with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my buddy Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do more shows pretty soon
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the comedy show, I don't know that
we were lost, but I do know that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember exactly where the car was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where the car was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know that we knew how to get
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't an issue because we're two grown
men in Denver and we're like, let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking walk around and find the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were plenty of interesting people to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver has its own brand of freaks and
weirdos and unique people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just roamed around and did a couple
of laps around the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran into a few friends that knew who I
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ran into some folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know who they were, but they knew
who I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we ran into the always wonderful
Tenasi and his pops and his lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were great to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to introduce my buddy Clint to my
friend Tenasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Tenasi at Tenasi
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following Tenasi,
give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great grower, great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we found the car and we drove home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a very successful Joe Rogan
comedy experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next weekend, I got to go see my
favorite band on the damn planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best band in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go see Fish at Dick's in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick's is a giant soccer field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds about 27,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold out three nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I went to all three shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never miss a Colorado show when Fish
comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish weekend was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my release.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my vacation of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I cut loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I work hard for all year to
where I can just go for three days and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually turns out being like a four or
five day trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts a day early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after the Fish shows, I always need
another day to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reentry is a struggle at some points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gone having fun, living in a
hotel room, partying on a parking lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out with my best friends,
smoking dank all day, doing whatever else
[SPEAKER_00]: we do and seeing the best band on the
planet all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after the band plays, we go and dance
somewhere else and do more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming back to reality can be a little bit
of a bitch after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fish weekend was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was three days and three nights of
amazing music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see so many of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people that I only see on a
yearly basis when they come through for
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish or when I go to Fish and bump into
them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really good time to see those
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are folks that I've seen every year
at Dick's for four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the ninth year that the band has
played there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have developed a nice little family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little community that goes on
within the Fish community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got our own little sub Denver,
Colorado Fish community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's an extra little sub community
of the ganja industry that goes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one day, there's a cool little
gathering of a bunch of ganja growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja industry folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all hung out and smoked out together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the people that I
got to hang out with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the Fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get down, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go down into the front on the
floor anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a little bit older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have a little bit of personal
space at the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got really long arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got really long dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my arms out and I spin around in a
circle like I'm a plane flying around like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little kid having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my release at a Fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go toward the back and have some
fun and not spill drinks with my dreads,
[SPEAKER_00]: not bump into people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the security ladies came up to me
and she's like, hey, would you like a
[SPEAKER_00]: floor pass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted to give me a floor pass so that
I could get down on the floor and boogie a
[SPEAKER_00]: little closer to the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, my hair is too long and my
arms are too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go down there and spill everybody's
drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: She laughed at me and gave me a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, you guys are so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She met everybody at the Fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're super kind people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there to help each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Friday night, some of my friends
brought their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two of them and they've got
three children, so they were outnumbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no questions that everybody
around us will help you keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: those kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody sees a kid that needs help or
sees something that needs to be said or
[SPEAKER_00]: done, we've all got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to make the parents just
struggle by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unspoken, but it all worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kids had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you got kids, but it was a
great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take good care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there to push and shove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there to fuck things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there to get down on some music and
spread some good vibes and recharge our
[SPEAKER_00]: soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting down by myself, backed up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lady wanted to give me that floor
pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I declined because I did not want to
go down on the floor and bump into
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: She walked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continued dancing like a silly hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my vape pen in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking on a Green Dot vape pen filled
with Green Dot concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sucking on this thing like it's
a pacifier having a good old time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not paying much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my groove on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes a real sheriff, not a security
guard, not like event staff, but a
[SPEAKER_00]: sheriff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has got a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has got mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a mustache.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got cop glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ripping my vape pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sheriff stopped directly in front
of me and made eye contact with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: squared up with me and began to dance like
a fucking hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sheriff was boogieing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was making eye contact with me through
his glasses and dancing like a hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went a little low.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went a little low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was laughing inside so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my vape pen in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured the only thing to do was offer
it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just reached out a little bit with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hit this, sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just laughed so hard and shook his
head, put his hand on my shoulder like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a funny fucking guy and walked
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the funniest experiences
I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's like at a fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security tries to give you passes you're
not supposed to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops dance with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed basically in the same spot for
all three nights, so all of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: knew where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nice little location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the three nights, everybody
just circled by and gave me a hug,
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a high five, said, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to boogie right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I create a little dance space and a little
vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go start the party and start
dancing by yourself right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the other hippies want to come and
dance with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a nice little dance party going
on in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, a bunch of hippie dudes,
a bunch of hippie girls just spinning with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of like rotation of people come
and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends come and go and say,
hi, come give me a high five, come give me
[SPEAKER_00]: a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that it's like therapy and church
all rolled into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel so much better after going and just
shaking my booty for three nights to my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get too much into the
actual music that Fish played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people here do not care about Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played excellent music, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every time I go see Fish,
I say they were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: One night, they reached a new level,
which I have never heard Fish reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish has four members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded like there were about 20
members on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music was top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did some great music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you guys don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to skip that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what needs to be said about the
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: After the concert, every night after the
show, there was a party on the parking
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes when you see Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the highlight for me was, that's a
debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a marching band that shows up at
all of the shows and they play funk tunes
[SPEAKER_00]: and they play Fish tunes marching band
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a dude with a bass drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a dude with a snare drum,
a nice horn section.
[SPEAKER_00]: They march around and they play a bunch of
really groovy tunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dance to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a bunch of my friends from Lawrence,
Kansas have a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is either a Ford Ranchero or a Chevy El
Camino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly didn't pay enough attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the back of this vehicle is turned
into a ball pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a Chuck E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheese ball pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have filled the back with colorful
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hung a disco ball above the ball pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have souped up the vehicle with
an amazing sound system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that run this vehicle and run the
sound system know exactly what music to
[SPEAKER_00]: play to get the party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play things like the Bloodhound Gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play stuff like Madonna.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really play a bunch of great 80s
dance music that just keeps the pulse
[SPEAKER_00]: going and keeps the crowd moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played Like a Prayer by Madonna and
every female in the crowd, in the group,
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly turned into a teenage girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like they were all in their
bathroom, in front of the mirror,
[SPEAKER_00]: using their brush as a microphone,
just getting down, just, just,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a prayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of them of those girls knew
every single word of that Madonna song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really fun to watch everybody just
connect and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were grown men, myself included,
singing fucking Madonna songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We danced in the parking lot at the ball
pit car until about two o'clock every
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when that party ended, we had to find
somewhere else to go and boogie down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually the night ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up back at the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got to repeat the process Saturday
and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get up, go find some delicious
food, have a great lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go hit the fish parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get to the parking lot about
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would hang out with a bunch of good
friends, roam around, smoke, eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: be merry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then around six thirty or seven every
night, I would get my pockets together and
[SPEAKER_00]: I would head into the show, go find myself
a drink, go find a snack, go chill out for
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of minutes, rest my legs,
go find a cool shade spot, get a seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once the band came on,
I would stand up and honestly just go find
[SPEAKER_00]: a cool dancing spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I would enjoy the show and
say hi to all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Fish, at Dick's, in Commerce City,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hot as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to hear it in my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a couple of days since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take a break before I could
record, but my voice was shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sounded gravelly for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was well worth it singing along to my
favorite fish songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my fish weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to some of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honestly going to miss people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw so many damn great people at this
fish show that I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to leave people out of this
list, but I need to make sure to give some
[SPEAKER_00]: shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
buddy, Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker is a giant fish fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time seeing Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I did when I drove to
Denver was drove directly to Baker's house
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to go give him some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Baker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big shout out to my buddy,
Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I got to meet a friend who I've only
been corresponding with online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to meet up with people,
actually see what these people look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what kind of people they are,
shake their hands, smoke with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet my friend, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would rather stay mostly anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to call him Ryan on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, you grow dank weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to having more
conversations with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to
my friends, Jaren and Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaren from New Millennium Nutrients was
hanging out at the fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was randomly just walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been walking for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to go find some shade and
sit down in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a nice grassy area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to go kick it and relax
in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played with my phone for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned the corner and there was Jaren
from New Millennium Nutrients just hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his beautiful wife, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 90% sure her name was Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bad with names.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a really nice lady, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had fun talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came around the corner and there he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him, hey, I don't want to
interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you're here with your wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a third wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, dude, hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out, smoked a bowl or two,
allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hung out, chatted about nutrients,
chatted about fish, talked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, went for a little bit
of a walk, spent a few minutes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I parted ways with them so that I
could let them do their couple thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to intrude too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel just fine being by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go find more friends to hang out
with or I can go hang out by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some fun with Jaren and his
beautiful wife for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also got to see some of my
wonderful friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Erica and Patrick and
their entire family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet their children this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been friends for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only seen pictures and heard
wonderful stories about their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to finally meet those little
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually brought me a cool gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little My Friend, My Friend
bracelet from them because they know that
[SPEAKER_00]: My Friend is one of my favorite fish
songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, My Friend was the first song that
fish played at my first fish show in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have seen a lot of fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably seen more fish shows than
you have seen all of your concerts
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends, Erica and
Patrick and their sweet family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your children are adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me boogie down with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an honor to kind of help out with
the family when you had so many kids and
[SPEAKER_00]: only two of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to my buddy,
Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew and Luke bring the ball pit car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that ball pit car, the parking lot
party would just not be the fucking same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I met a lot of people that listen to
the podcast and a lot of people that know
[SPEAKER_00]: and support iRead Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also iRead Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you follow along,
know that I'm also iRead Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed breeder, the seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people support the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them reached out and said hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard, hey Ross, hey Dredd, hey Ross to
Jeff, hey RJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many times I had to stop and say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to stop and say hi to so many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave away so many seed packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody said hello and they mentioned
that they grow weed and they had a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room, I gave them seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to seeing all those
seeds grow in people's flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a really good time to say hello
to so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you stopped me and you said hello,
you gave me a hug, you shook my hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you passed me a joint, you passed me a
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying hi to me at the fish
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told so many people that I was going to
give them a shout out that I honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to miss anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to try to say any names,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like royalty at the fucking fish
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going to fish shows for so long
that I know many, many people in the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in Colorado for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know many, many people in the
Colorado crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For quite a while, I've been making a name
for myself in the cannabis and podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people knew who I was and it
felt amazing to be treated like a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrity at a fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all of my friends who
made the weekend amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra gigantic fucking shout out to fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never going to hear this,
but God damn big shout out to the boys and
[SPEAKER_00]: fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made an amazing weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really cannot wait for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said this before, if you guys go
to a concert or a show and you see me,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks down to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not look like the friendliest
person, but to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love meeting new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to come tell me that you listen
to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've got some seeds in my pocket and
I might give you a free five pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like hearing about it the
day after the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, I saw you at the fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't bother to say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to tweet you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck kind of shit is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hello, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the internet stuff,
but come shake my hand.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel like that was a great review
of some of the fun that I get to have.

on this podcast.

overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to share with you what I'm
doing, let you be involved in my life.

helps us connect.
