[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, it's Rasta Jeff and it's
time for the New Year's episode of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode number 381,
thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, this episode is brought to you
by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you need new seeds,
you get them from the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a bit of a tradition that we
talk about what I'm dabbing as we start
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of Stardog
Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: also been hitting the Copper Chem from
Green Dot Labs, a beautiful combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them have that gassy, feely taste
that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been spoiling myself for the
holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're smoking on something
delicious also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've been spending time with
great friends and good family and I also
[SPEAKER_00]: hope you got to smoke with somebody new
this holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got to sneak off with that cool
cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you finally got one of your brothers
or sisters who's always been uptight to
[SPEAKER_00]: finally burn one with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe, you even got grandma to
hit the vape pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got to do something cool with
your family over this holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have or had a great,
safe New Year whenever you listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything went well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a great evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a great New Year's kiss or
took a fat New Year's dab and I hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: made it home safely in one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is the Happy New Year
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a happy winter
holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever holiday you celebrate,
I hope it was beautiful and perfect for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also hope you have a great, safe New
Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some things we can do
with this fresh, new calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to set goals at the beginning of a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like setting goals and writing them
down really keeps us focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say some goals out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, hey, Rasta Jeff, in 2019,
I think I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to give you a fat ass dab
and we're going to start talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in four hours, you'll forget you even
talked about a goal or having any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: goals for the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're going to set goals,
it is my advice to write those goals down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a pen, get some paper and write down
one goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really ambitious, write down
three goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a goal-oriented person who likes
to crush a to-do list, make a list for 12
[SPEAKER_00]: things and try to get one big thing done
every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a person that's intimidated by
goals, get one thing done this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you write down a goal and you
accomplish it, you will feel good about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you accomplish a goal, what's the
next step?
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a bigger goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You crush that goal and it continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start adding to the to-do list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting more confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting more things done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start expanding as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life gets bigger and better and it just
expands as things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes exponentially in that pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So create a goal, small or large.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you as long as we have got a
goal and we write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write it down on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write it down on a Google Drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write it down on a note in your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you go and write down that goal
and review it occasionally and look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and think about what you have done to get
yourself to that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to be really detailed,
write down three steps that it would take
[SPEAKER_00]: to get yourself to that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say your goal is to walk to the
front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the first three steps?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to aim myself toward the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got to take a bunch of steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound like a small goal,
but once you get there, you've
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've made a clear path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've accomplished the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's your next goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten some shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's set some goals for the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start talking about garden goals we
can set.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people listening to this show
keep saying to me in emails or to their
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriends in conversation or to their
bros while they're in their car or smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want to start a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not make this year the year that you
start to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down, make it a goal and make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have given you plenty of advice on how
to get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to get your shit together and
start that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's stopping you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are a few things that may be
stopping several of you, but you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: saying you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to sound silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang up some lights, put some seeds in
some dirt and finally get growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're already growing,
there are plenty of things we can set as
[SPEAKER_00]: garden goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about higher potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about better yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about better scheduling?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about setting a better routine and a
better cycle for the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the day you cut down plants,
you've got plants prepared to go into that
[SPEAKER_00]: room so that you never miss a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about improving your cleanliness?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of things we can improve
and plenty of goals we can set in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're doing in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where you're lacking in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your weak point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not a good clone cutter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not good at transplanting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you not know how to defoliate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not good at popping and twisting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you not know how to work the canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not really comfortable mixing up
nutrients and getting the pH adjusted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your weakness and master that this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe find a couple of weaknesses and
cover three or four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 12 full months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not make a goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small goal for every month
and then a good goal for every three
[SPEAKER_00]: months and then a huge goal for the year,
you're really on pace to increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden experience and your potential and
your learning base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you just live your life like that
with so many goals and so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, your life will just be fulfilled
and you will be nourished and you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched and you'll be a better person
inside and out because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention while you're in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out where you're lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your weak spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a note of that and make it a
conscious effort to improve on that over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next 365 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we meet next year to talk about this,
when you say, man, I really did improve on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you will have so much pride at how
far you have come in one short year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm always talking about journaling
and keeping notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good time to take some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start the brand new year with the brand
new grow journal and on page one,
[SPEAKER_00]: write some goals on page one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one major goal, maybe three small
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to do, make sure you
write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, hey, Rasta Jeff said to create a
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that notebook through the rest of the
year to take your notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one year, open that up to page one and
look at your goals and think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I accomplished those goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have I done to get myself closer to
those goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I get to that goal if I haven't
already gotten there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I mentioned earlier, it's always
helpful when you're writing goals to list
[SPEAKER_00]: steps of how you can achieve that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your brain is thinking about the
goal, you get inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain just starts firing and then you
can see the path.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it hard enough,
you can actually visualize how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what your goal is and then
maybe write down three steps to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: get there and check once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I doing these three steps or am I still
stuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I at zero or have I done step one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I done step two or have I fucked up
and jumped onto step three and missed
[SPEAKER_00]: steps one and two altogether and set
myself up for failure in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention to what your goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the steps to get there
and don't lose sight of your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it is fair to change your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you learn something different,
if you get a better idea, you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: learning, you're always expanding,
don't feel stuck to a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you learn more and get a better idea,
a better thought process, just make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's well thought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a plan, we set a goal and then we
realize, oh, that's not exactly what I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I was going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to rethink everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to abandon ship and
rethink it if that's the appropriate move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't puss out and give up just because
you get scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you realize you're aiming at the
wrong target, you got to adjust aim for
[SPEAKER_00]: this target over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always do that in the grow and in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your goals this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your goals in life?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your goals in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have goals, always be moving
forward and then you won't get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get stuck in life, once you get
stuck in the garden, it is really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: get unstuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's best just to keep moving forward,
never slow down, never stop, never get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you never have to pull yourself out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to stay motivated is to
set a goal, keep crushing those goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you feel that rewarding experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you set a higher goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you stay motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep reaching those goals and it is a
positive cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps you set up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success, you guys,
in the garden and in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus more on growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are a few goals we can set in our
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that we can increase
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to increase your
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That starts in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can improve your pH, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably improve the quality of
your feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably dial in the amount of
each nutrient a little more closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient feedings are very strain
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to learn your individual
cultivars more specifically and build a
[SPEAKER_00]: closer relationship with each plant in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a couple of ways to increase
yield during the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also work on cracking and twisting
the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work on canopy control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work on canopy management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a couple of other ways
throughout the veg phase you can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn a few things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set goals and learn things to increase the
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we want to increase potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has access to lab testing,
but I bet you and your friends and or
[SPEAKER_00]: customers can tell the difference in the
quality of the product you started growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the product you're growing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell there's a difference in
potency and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can set a goal to make that even
better and take a few steps to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing I bet would improve
most of your potency, flavor and aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board for most growers is
learning a better dry and cure technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've put out a full episode of drying
and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to listen to the drying
and curing episode, it is episode 326.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another goal that I know almost every
grower could set and always reach is
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the grow room just a little bit
cleaner than we did last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just focus a little bit more on
cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a little bit more time on cleaning
up after yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may add 10 minutes to each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about an hour a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all afford one more hour a week to
clean up after ourselves because in the
[SPEAKER_00]: long run, imagine how much time you'll
save if you don't have to go look for
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a large grow, walking from flower room
A to the bedroom number one could take
[SPEAKER_00]: several minutes just to walk from one room
to the other because in a large grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a lot of space to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to go find whatever you lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the way back, you're going to get
distracted and have to do something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the task you were doing just got
abandoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to remember, oh, yeah,
I was over there doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I've got scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got scissors in my hand and I'm
standing in the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to go get your brain back on
track to what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just clean up and put the scissors
where they go, put the measuring devices
[SPEAKER_00]: where they go, put the hoses where they
go, put the goggles and gloves and spray
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment where it goes and have it
cleaned and prepared for the next use,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will save yourself so much time in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe set a goal of being a little more
organized and working on cleanliness in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just a couple of practical ideas
I can think of off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, everybody wants more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants more overall product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been to a lot of grows and I know
that most of us could work on a cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I don't know where
you're lacking in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your weak point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identify that weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your ego go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accept that you've got a weakness in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that every one of us
could improve on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could improve on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all improve on everything in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you stop thinking you can
improve is when you start becoming a
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accept your weakness, embrace your
weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's find ways to improve on that
weakness and make you a rock star grower
[SPEAKER_00]: in all aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think I've ranted
on long enough about goals and setting
[SPEAKER_00]: goals and reaching goals and trying to
motivate everybody to have a good positive
[SPEAKER_00]: start to the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it is the start of a new year,
there are also some things we could do in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow to make the grow run more
smoothly throughout the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, a little bit of
cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a little bit of maintenance will
make our day to day tasks go much more
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also make some of our equipment
last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay a lot of money for high quality
equipment in our grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be in our best interest to take
care of that equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to keep buying a brand new pH
meter every couple of months in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and you work for a commercial grow,
that could have been your Christmas bonus
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about things like that and you will
start taking better care of all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet if you had to buy all of the tools
in your commercial grow, you would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably take a little better care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably wouldn't wonder where you
left those scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably wouldn't wonder where that pH
pen is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to buy it in a commercial grow,
I bet you would know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a few things we can
do at the start of the year and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: should do at the start of every month that
will help the grow run smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I really recommend is that at
the start of every month, we clean and
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate the pH meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use that pH meter every time you water
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing should be cleaned and
calibrated very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dipping it into solutions with a
bunch of salty junk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's getting left somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where the grotex are putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're putting it back in the
solution that keeps it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're just setting it on the
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're setting it in dirty water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to clean that occasionally and
make sure that it's clean and calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not the first of every month?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean and calibrate your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're using a TDS, or an EC
meter, clean that at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is also a good time to clean and
replace your air conditioning filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your air conditioner have a
replaceable filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your HVAC system have filtration that
needs to be replaced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a very good time to replace all of
those things and write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make yourself a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I changed all of the air conditioner
filters or I cleaned all of the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner filters on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when the HVAC tech comes, and says,
man, this filter is dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is the last time you changed this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just hang your head and say,
bro, I haven't changed that since January
[SPEAKER_00]: 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now you probably don't know when
the last time it was changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather have a date than a question
mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So write it down and change that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it may be a good time to check on
your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that carbon filter still working or is
it just a decoration at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to bring somebody that
doesn't consume and smell a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and have them walk out side
wherever that filter is being blown and
[SPEAKER_00]: just give it a little sniff test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they smell your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't smell my own garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't smell a lot of commercial grows
unless it is stanky and pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drive up to places with other people
in my car and we'll be a half a block away
[SPEAKER_00]: from some grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friends will start going smells
real good here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a restaurant or something like,
dude, you can't smell that grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm immune to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around so much cannabis that
I've got to put my face in it or it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be super stank from my nose to even
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're around your grow all the
time, you might not even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't even notice they stink
because they stink all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When someone else comes around and they
go, bro, you smell like armpits and
[SPEAKER_00]: onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, oh shit, I didn't even know
somebody had to tell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I feel about a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not even know that your grow is
stinking up the whole block until somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: comes and tells you maybe have one of your
friends be the one to tell you instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighbors or law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that carbon filter working or has it
become a decoration that is just slowing
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just slowing down air flow at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be time to replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when you replace it, get a piece of
duct tape, write the date on that duct
[SPEAKER_00]: tape and slap it somewhere on that carbon
filter so that you know January 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running an RO machine or
some sort of water filter, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really good time to check and clean
and replace those filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think you're filtering your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just be running your water through
a bunch of dirty shit and feeding your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the water you started with and
wasting a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RO machine spits out a lot of
wastewater.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your filters are dirty, it's shooting
out a lot of extra wastewater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is kind of precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say water is not
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run 100 gallons of water down the drain
and tell me it's not expensive at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a difference when you see it in
large quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost hurts your feelings to have to
waste that much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you waste a lot of water,
you're kind of wasting a lot of life
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean up all of your water filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we don't waste a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to reduce your bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to reduce waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also may increase the health of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set those filters up for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the filters are too dirty,
even work, you're just putting in that
[SPEAKER_00]: crap back into the water and running it
through the filter, wasting time,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting water, wasting energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean up your filtration if you are
using water filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that probably needs to be
cleaned is your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small rez that you store
your water in, if you've got a gigantic
[SPEAKER_00]: rez in which you store your water,
it probably needs a scrub in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would dry it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would get some sort of a cleaning
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use Fizan 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix about 15 to 20 milliliters of
Fizan 20 in a gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would use that like a cleaning
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd dip it into a rag and just scrub the
inside of my reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are using the Fizan 20,
please wear gloves when you're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fizan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even use goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the recommended PPE for
Fizan, but I would certainly wear gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would probably put on goggles just
to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean the reservoir, then rinse it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want any Fizan left in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know if it's left because it makes
a lot of bubbles and it has a very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the Fizan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse that out real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your reservoir is nice and clean and
disinfected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can go back to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a piece of duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write, I cleaned this reservoir on January
1st, 2019 and stick that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every time you see that, if it's been
a couple of months, it'll start to bug
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, man, I haven't cleaned that in
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably getting pretty grody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting grody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's funk building up in there that
will start affecting the health of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we are cleaning the tank,
if you've got any sort of hydro lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in a commercial environment and
you are running a feed system,
[SPEAKER_00]: a drip system, an auto water system,
also known as a fertigation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys, that's another word for the
glossary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a good time to clean out all of
those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a good time to clean the pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that same Fizan and water
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run that through your pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can soak the pumps right in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's too corrosive to where
it's going to damage your pump,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it will take off all the algae and all
the funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that pump apart as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Submerge that in the Fizan solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a good scrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may need to hit it with a scrub
brush and a toothbrush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up your pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse it out real well so there's no Fizan
solution back left in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out the rest of the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run that Fizan water through your hydro
lines if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always a good idea when you're
building a drip system to put a ball valve
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of it so that you can run water
right through there and just clean out
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't done that, that may be a
good addition in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a good idea for your next auto
watering or assisted watering project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to clean out those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to let a bunch of funk build
up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of nasty shit build up in
the fertigation lines, in the long PVC
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes, in the black poly tubes,
in the skinny poly tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen slimy, moldy, stinky shit come
out of there that you do not want to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of Fizan, a little bit of
warm water will go a long way in cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: your hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one more thing I want to talk about
specifically is our bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you been running?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bulbs in your veg and your flower
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time to swap out your bulbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the quality of the bulbs you
purchased, depending on the light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: you chose to run, depending on your
ballast, there are so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that determine it, but over time
your bulbs have slowly stopped putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: as much light, but they are still
consuming as much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is always a good idea to consider a
bulb change every couple of harvests,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending again on your bulb strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you running a thousand, a six,
or a four hundred watt bulb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you buy cheap bulbs or did you buy
good expensive bulbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought those lesser expensive
bulbs, you may want to swap them every
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought good expensive bulbs,
you may want to run those two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: grows before you swap them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that bulbs are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to push those bulbs
as many grows as you can, just so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can maximize your output with the
equipment you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, you may be shooting a
hundred percent of the electricity into
[SPEAKER_00]: that bulb and only getting fifty percent
of the lumens that you're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your paying for a hundred percent of
that light to come out and only fifty
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of it is coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably costs around a hundred dollars
a month to run a high pressure sodium bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: for that one hundred dollars a month for
the next two months, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: two hundred dollars worth of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only going to put one hundred
dollars worth of electricity onto those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's already one hundred dollars
worth of electricity that you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do anything with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got lost somewhere down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through the electrical wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went down through the red, through the
white, through the black, and then it hit
[SPEAKER_00]: your bulb and it just stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come out of the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, you'll need to make a business
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to keep paying for electricity
to come down the wires and just not
[SPEAKER_00]: happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to replace that bulb that
may cost you fifty to one hundred,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one hundred and twenty bucks for a
really high end high pressure sodium bulb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Swap out the bulb and actually get all the
electricity you're paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for that electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that that other bulb cost you
more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to spend the money on
electricity either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about the math,
once that bulb diminishes to approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: seventy, sixty, definitely fifty percent,
you're paying for one hundred percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the electricity and you were getting fifty
percent of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're spending two hundred bucks and
you're getting one hundred bucks worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go buy another bulb,
which will probably cost you one hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're spending three hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two hundred on electricity and
another hundred on the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were getting one hundred percent,
probably one hundred and ten percent
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what you were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hundred and ten percent of the output
and your plants are really going to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can wait till harvest time,
it will be worth it if you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good time to check on your
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time to consider swapping your
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you swap that bulb, get some sort of
sticky note, get some sort of duct tape
[SPEAKER_00]: right down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I change this bulb on January 1st,
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you know when the bulbs are
fresh, that when they start flickering or
[SPEAKER_00]: when they don't look as bright as they
used to be, you could say, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that thing's been in there for two
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things been in there for three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably time to invest some of my
grow money back into itself and replace
[SPEAKER_00]: that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often I talk about using a string and a
lumen meter to determine when to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to go over that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get something that is a consistent length.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a tape measure if you have
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a piece of string if that is
more handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can purchase or borrow a lumen
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the grow stores will loan you a
lumen meter if you've got a local friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to loan them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, they know that you're going to
come buy a bulb when it gets too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a brand new bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire that bulb up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little bit to get to its maximum
shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes these grow lights a few minutes
to warm up to get to their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it maybe 30 or 40 minutes to get
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it shining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure a distance from that bulb,
maybe 12, 16, 18 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then set up your lumen meter and measure
the amount of lumens that you're receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: on the meter right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day one, I was receiving this many
lumens at this distance away on this meter
[SPEAKER_00]: from this bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to remember where you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the center of the bulb,
18 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down, but try to remember where
you were visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to line that up and
do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a mental note of where you were
physically in the room and how you were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it because we're going to do that
again about every 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it again in 30 days and
make a note how many lumens are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to do it at 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll do it at 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's do it at 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one source of energy
for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do want water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do want air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do need some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the light they receive is their number
one source of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what makes them thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why wouldn't we do our best to give
them the most light we can afford to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the environment we've put them in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean go try to stick a thousand
watt bulb in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean why not maximize our
potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a closet, put the biggest
bulb you can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that closet, put a 315 in there if you
think you can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when that 315 bulb starts to dim out,
starts reducing its output, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can maximize the potential of
your grow space and your grow light no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter the size of your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my New Year's rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more thing I would like to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank everybody for listening
to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank you for all of the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank you for all of the
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were listening to the podcast,
if you were supporting the podcast in any
[SPEAKER_00]: way, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening on iTunes,
Stitcher, Google Play, wherever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a YouTube subscriber,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have ever left a comment or words
of encouragement, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've contributed to the show on
Patreon, I owe you a huge high five,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even a bro hug and a huge thank you
for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the feedback and
thank you for trusting me with your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that those plants are your
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you have invested a lot of
money and time and personal energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a lot of hopes and dreams for
that garden and I understand that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: you rely on me to keep that garden going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the trust and thank you
for believing in me and knowing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would never steer you wrong and that all I
want to do is make you the best grower
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can be so that we can all grow
the best cannabis we can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we've got all the medicine we
need for sick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all the recreational cannabis we
need for people that just want to recreate
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be a rock star in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody who wants to learn about
cannabis to be able to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from a person who has experience
and passion with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn a lot from books,
but to be quite honest with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the stuff I learned in books
really looks good on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really pan out in a large scale
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here to teach you in a way that
actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to teach you ways that I have
tested and put to use in small grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: large grows, commercial grows,
private grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to share all of my knowledge
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I really appreciate you for
following along, for supporting me,
[SPEAKER_00]: for trusting in me and believing in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for listening to me rant
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I get long-winded, but sometimes
you got to explain shit at multiple angles
[SPEAKER_00]: for different people to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being so supportive and thanks
for being a big part of what has become
[SPEAKER_00]: the iRe Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, here's where I start

is I pay for the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I host the podcast on my website,
iReGeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cost a little bit of money to host
the podcast there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay for that website with those Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I did use the Patreon contributions
to replace the MacBook on which I record
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old MacBook kind of took a crap on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a new one with the help of my
Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, big thank you to everyone who
supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where your funding is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also goes to replace these microphone
covers so that when Mike comes over and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dad and Granny come over and Jesse comes
over, they're not all spitting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I put water bottles on the table for
each of the guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small things like that are covered by the
Patreon contributions so that is hugely
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated not only by myself but by the
people who don't have to smell other folks
[SPEAKER_00]: breath on their microphone covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you to everybody who has and
will contribute to the Patreon campaign.
