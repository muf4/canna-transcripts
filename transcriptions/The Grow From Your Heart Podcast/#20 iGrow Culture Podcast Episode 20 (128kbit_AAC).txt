[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big, huge shout out to
Brad Wines for leaving a comment on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm coughing from a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me all choked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad, your comment has me choked up,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Brad at a dab festival at the Wright
Event Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either the 710 Cup or the Secret
Cup or one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes great photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: My current Twitter picture was actually
taken by Brad, so thanks for taking good
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a good member of the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes all the way from New Mexico to
Denver to all of the dab parties and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis events, so that is fucking cool
of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys leave comments on iTunes or
Stitcher, I will read it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also find all the comments on Facebook
and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't want to leave comments,
if you don't want to leave your name in a
[SPEAKER_00]: comment, if you want to be read on the
show but remain anonymous, feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: email that to me, iGrowCulture at hotmail
.com or send me a private message on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say your name on the show,
but I'll get your question out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a place where people can't
know you're a cannabis user, we'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and read your question without
anybody knowing it came from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to do a grow lesson on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about something real quick
before we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting out these flyers for the
iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Adam puts them out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts these little flyers, they're just
the size of a quarter sheet of paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: says listen to the iGrowCulture podcast
for free grow lessons and cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something funny that happened,
we did that episode at the hookah bar and
[SPEAKER_00]: I left a few of those there on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police had been going to that hookah
bar randomly, trying to bust people
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening, but the only thing
they found are these iGrowCulture podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: flyers with a weed leaf on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They insist that that is some sort of code
to get weed or something somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took the time to scan the QR code
that is on that flyer, it brought you to
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, sorry, I'm coughing because I took
a dab in the privacy of my own home like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allowed to do as a Colorado resident.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cops are listening to this show,
the QR code worked, the flyer did exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an ad to get people to listen to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a flyer that says to listen to a
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought that was some sort of code to
get you some free weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inaccurate, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great police work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously can't breathe from the dab
that I just took.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me a second to take a drink and
I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll read some news and we will get on
with it with a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've recovered from those dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a nice drink of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got nice and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read you a news article that
comes from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually written in the cannabis
again from our good friend Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Edibles Recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: At home bakes use of washing machine for
hash questioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the popular Denver based brand of
marijuana infused edibles was recalled by
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver Department of Environmental Health
on July 17th because of the possible
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination from unsanitary equipment
and use of equipment not intended for food
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the department's public
health inspections division, the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer of the recalled edibles at
home baked operates on the same state
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana license as dispensary group
advanced medical alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really frustrated with the entire
situation, said A.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashkar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, he's also known to me as A.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashman.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would always call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said I saw Ashkar and I just said
Hashkar because it seemed like it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the coroner of at home baked,
who is known in the Denver marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: industry as A.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashman, they came in and the machine
which we're utilizing to make water hash
[SPEAKER_00]: was not food, not a food safe machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food safe machines to make water hash do
not exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They deemed the water hash that we were
making unfit for human consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though nobody has gotten sick from
our hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Environmental Health
verified that there haven't been any
[SPEAKER_00]: reports of illness yet, but a food safety
inspection was the reason for the recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashkar has been using a modified washing
machine to activate his water hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: a common practice in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the centrifugal action that is
essential to the water hash, said Ashkar,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known for his popular marijuana meet
and greets in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, A.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: throws some great parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't been able to do them anymore
because the Denver police have actually
[SPEAKER_00]: been shutting those parties down because
we're smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the article says my business
partner and I both have culinary
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds, food service backgrounds,
and we look at water hash as a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate, not a food, Ashkar said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they say as soon as you start working
with it, with a food as the intent or the
[SPEAKER_00]: end result, it is food, which I kind of
agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's got to be food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to eat that hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the active ingredient that we're
searching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: In June, Ashkar received a variance from
the state through September to find a food
[SPEAKER_00]: safe alternative, and he purchased a
bubble magic machine he hopes will satisfy
[SPEAKER_00]: their regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, the state demanded that
he recall all products made in his old
[SPEAKER_00]: washing machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: At home baked products were recalled on
July 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, let me reread that sentence for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The at home baked products that were
recalled on July 17th include its infused
[SPEAKER_00]: brownie mixes, blondie mixes, rice krispie
treats, and sticks candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm fired up on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going really fast because I want to
get to that grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continues to say, please pull our
products off your shelf and place in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back room and contact me to replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: At home baked published on its Facebook on
July 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry for the inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to restocking you ASAP
once we have more info and a time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: At home baked will replace all products in
question or refund purchase, as Ashkar
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Environmental Health is
saying that any of the above at home baked
[SPEAKER_00]: products should be removed from the retail
shelves and destroyed immediately pursuant
[SPEAKER_00]: to state medical and retail marijuana
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does this mean for at home baked
business?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extremely difficult blow,
Ashkar said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be difficult to keep our head above
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's rough times for AJ Hashman and
the at home baked company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to AJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been a huge supporter of this
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually threw those meet and greets
like they were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to an event in Colorado,
AJ has got a booth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving out sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving out free samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done a lot for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he does get his products back on
the shelf, somebody, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries needs to send them over to
Steep Hill Halent Labs, get them tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the profile printed out, post that
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show what he's got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we should all go buy those if
it's a good product again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should support AJ to help him get
back on his feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a big blow for a small
company like what AJ has got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make the news real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one news article this week
because I want to get to the Grow Lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got quite a bit of information that
I want to kind of cram into just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm scrolling through my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we do that, I need to give
another shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This portion of the podcast, the Grow
Lesson, is brought to you by Hygro Indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beech
Street Unit F or stop by the new Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver
.com for current store hours and special
[SPEAKER_00]: sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out the new location in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to know that I'm sending people
[SPEAKER_00]: to the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get down to a Grow Lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks ago, we cut some clones,
we germinated seeds, and then we put those
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings and clones into cups to let them
develop roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably on the time schedule I've
been on, it's probably past time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: those into pots and start the vegetative
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if I'm a little behind
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of podcasting to try to
cram in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's talk about the size pots
we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go straight into the pots that
I'm going to finish in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I transplant into now from the cups
is going to be our finished pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choosing your pot size is an important
thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run my test plants in three
gallon pots and my big plants in seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys like to go even bigger,
but for an indoor crop, I think a seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot is plenty large enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going outside, shit,
you can go 50 to 100, or I've seen 250
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots outside, earth pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going that big, you should
just go into the ground, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I think I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to five gallon pots are great for
vegging plants for a few weeks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to let them veg in three
gallon pots for longer than like 45 days
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants start to get too big for
that, they'll get a little bit root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to veg your plants for more
time to get bigger plants and bigger buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: use larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to run a fast crop, I run about
16 three gallon pots under a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are usually from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running like a little tester crop
is what I do that for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running a production crop,
I'll put between four and six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon pots under a thousand watt
light, depending on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get taller and thinner,
I'll put six of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're like bushier plants,
like I'll say the Grateful Dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll only put four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffery, I'll put six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of, because the Lemon Jeffery
gets taller than it does wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll put six of them under there and
pull a pretty nice harvest, about a pound
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half from six Lemon Jeffery plants
and seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under a thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I can get that pound and a half
from four of them, but I have to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: veg just a little bit longer, maybe like
two weeks more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the difference in the pot size
and the veg times and how many plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you start doing that kind of
math.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both of these methods will harvest me
about a pound, pound and a half if done
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller plants take less time to veg,
but I like the production from a seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem like they're able to grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they have a bigger root ball,
they just seem to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow larger in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem like they keep growing a little
bit taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cut off as early in their
growth phase in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also limited by plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few larger pots is better for the
medical growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a small grow space,
of course use smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have room for larger pots,
go for larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can experiment and see what and why
and how it all works best for your needs
[SPEAKER_00]: and your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much herb you need, how often you need
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strains you're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things that are going to
kind of decide this stuff for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse my dab cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take a lot of dabs when I record
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam was here watching me record and he's
like, dude, how do you even record with
[SPEAKER_00]: that many dabs going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded some stuff with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make another episode out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a little out of hand and just
started rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I'm doing that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've chosen your pot size,
it's time for good soil, like a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: fluffy soil with lots of perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had plenty of amendments, so I buy a
fairly inert soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have access to a good grow supply
store, then I recommend starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: something like roots organic, sunshine mix
number four, something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all great starters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a recycled and amended soil mix that
can get a little complex and it can make
[SPEAKER_00]: it hard to diagnose problems if one comes
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend learning with the basic
soil and organic bottled nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you have experience with farming,
horticulture, composting, or some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or plant education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you understand the basics of the
plants, we can make a super soil mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: work on eliminating the bottle feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, let's keep it simple and
develop a good understanding of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we want to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some soil, you got some
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you've got some small plants that are
in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get those babies into the big girl
pots and then we'll talk about feeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetation phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the little babies in cups is
really going to help out and make it easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill my pots with soil and I pack it in
there slightly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just press it down with my hands and I
don't pack it so tightly that the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: can't dig through, but I do want to pack
it tightly enough to where the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have plenty of support once I
bury that root ball in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil is packed too lightly,
you'll know because as soon as you water,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water's just going to run right
through the dirt and the soil is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cave in and then you'll have to refill in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, fill your pots about two
inches from the top or more for bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to save some space for watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seven gallon pot will take a gallon of
water or more and that needs some space in
[SPEAKER_00]: your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a three gallon pot, you'll easily take
half a gallon up to a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So save yourself some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get the pot mostly full and then I
dig out about a large handful of soil out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the center of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set the clone in the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in the plastic cup right now
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set that cup in the spot where the clone
is going to go and I backfill the dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: around the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes a perfect little spot for the
clone to fit without disturbing the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't leave the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I want to stress that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not leave the cup on the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only for that one second while I was
making an indention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't leave the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use it to make a little space for
the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got the perfect little space in
there, made for my clone, I pull that cup
[SPEAKER_00]: out with the clone in it and then I hold
the cup upside down with my hand on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cup with the clone coming out between
my middle and ring finger and I flip the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it a little squeeze and then I
usually could just squeeze it and shake it
[SPEAKER_00]: until the clone slides out of the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try not to disturb the roots and
that soil ball that come right out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shake it and it'll come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And set that little soil ball perfectly
into that perfect little spot that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be the same shape as the cup
since you just make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just set it right down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the cup comes off, there'll be dirt
falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll seem chaotic and messy, but just
stay calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drop dirt and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't drop the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just focus on getting that tiny little
root ball into that hole that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've taken your cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flipped it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little baby plant's falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a handful of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding your new fucking life right
there in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set it in that, remember that little
toy you used to have when you were a kid?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to put the little peg into the
hole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you want to do, just set it right
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you got to get some dirt and put
it over the top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get it like a small handful of soil
and I drop it over the top of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right where, not the whole plant,
but all the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right where I just put the new freshly
planted plant and all around the rest to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of level it out so that you just kind
of camouflage where the spot was and you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just want to blend it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want all that to become one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I press it down just tightly enough to
hold the plant upright and carefully label
[SPEAKER_00]: your newly potted plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks having a plant that's not
labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cup was well labeled, also leave
that cup in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way if your label comes off,
the cup is still in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just use the cup, but once in
a while I knock the cup out and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I've got that potted, I set it
under the light and I keep working until
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my new babies are in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once everything is potted is when I'll
feed them and make sure to get the pots
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a crop of freshly
transplanted planted babies under the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's pretty much the beginning
of the vegetative growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to mix up some nutrients and
feed them their first full veg nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a soil grower, so I pretty much focus
on a dirt garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a hydro garden,
we're going to have to get a hydro guy on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show here in the future and have him
teach you guys some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's feed our new babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, I recommend mixing
your nutrients in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use an accurate measuring device for your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the shot glass that has milliliters
and stuff marked on it for small
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: For larger stuff, there's a pint glass
that is marked with milliliters and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find those at your local hydro
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a half gallon pitcher that fits
perfectly into my five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned to mix my nutrients into that
pitcher and add that to the bucket instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of mixing my nutrients directly into a
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to pour out five gallons of
water when you mess up mixing your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of water to pour down the
drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your pitcher three quarters of the
way with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add your nutrients of choice to the
pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use a good base nutrient,
a good root inoculant, and some good
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, I would use 50 milliliters
of Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Veg Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Formula as my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use OGT or Great White Shark as my
mycos, which is your inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use 15 milliliters of Hygrozyme as
my enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my garden, I would add a little bit of
liquid karma and a few other supplements,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add sweet to feed my beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add Vitamino for extra vitamins and
amino acids, and Vitamin B also.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I add in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like I added something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not looking to spend the extra
bucks, those aren't required, but I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to spoil my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: After about a week, or during the next
week, I'll feed Cal Mag and potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I run most of the Botanicare Pure
Blend Pro line when I run bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare is not a sponsor, but I've been
most satisfied with Botanicare and
[SPEAKER_00]: Organicare more than any other bottle
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran the Aurora Sol Synthetics,
which produce some super tasty products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran Psycho, which was probably not my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've ran a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran the Fox Farms Basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done so many, I can't even remember
them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you can find a pretty good
pre-made Botanicare feed chart on their
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to remember to post some of my
notes on the feeding programs for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tweet me and remind me at
Hygroculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this paper here in front of me,
so hopefully that'll remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on focus a little bit and
talk about mixing stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your bottled feeds in a small
container of water, but don't ever mix
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrients together without plenty of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pour like a shot glass, the
measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pour the veg stuff and then don't
pour enzymes into the same shot glass at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix those to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottled stuff is sold in separate
bottles to prevent bonding of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always mix into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once your pitcher is mixed, put that into
the five gallon bucket and fill it up the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the bucket's full, you need to adjust
the pH of your feed solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust your pH to 6.5 using pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unlikely that your pH is too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure you calibrate your pH meters
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a bucket full of nutrient
solution that has been pH adjusted to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our freshly transplanted babies
under a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we got to do is pour the
feed into the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, I hope you've got some type of
saucer or something under to catch the
runner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run off onto your plants also,
like sit your plants on a saucer or a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have something like that,
sometimes I use a, I've got a Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_00]: tray that'll fit three, three gallon pots
in there perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just pour water into the plants
and then it'll drain right into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you're going to end up with water
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need something to catch the runoff
that comes out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of use the pitcher that I'm
using to stir up the solution before I go
[SPEAKER_00]: right to the plants and try to mix up the
water a little bit, stir up the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea to stir everything
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I'm using a big batch,
sometimes I mix my nutrients into a much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw an air stone in there to pump it
up a little bit to aerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then while it's doing that,
I also use a big stick like the kind that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd use to support your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that to stir the water up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like stirring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mix it up a little bit, then simply
pour about a third of a gallon of water of
[SPEAKER_00]: the feed into each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using larger pots, you're going
to need more, you know, if the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: settles, then you need to add more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice pretty quickly if it,
like, crumbles down in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we add the water, all the air space
is going to get pushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to, yeah, the dirt's going to
move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to adjust some of your plants
and some of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water everything and refill any pots
that you need to fill with soil and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants under good lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 lights are good for veg if you have
enough of them close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halides are also ideal for veg
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to focus on getting those pots
full of roots right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue spectrum is kind of what we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs seem to be really good for veg
plants, but I personally don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with the LEDs, but I have seen
some great photographs coming from an LED
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Nancy Budwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's growing some bounty killer right
now, and it looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to keep your veg area around 72 to
77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using CO2, you can let it get a
little bit warmer, maybe low 80s during
[SPEAKER_00]: the light period.
[SPEAKER_00]: During your dark cycle, try to keep them
about the same temp or no more than 10
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees cooler than your daytime
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep your humidity around 40 to 55%
if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, it gets hard to keep the
rooms humid, so they get dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you'd rather have it too dry
than too humid if you have the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get it right where you want
it, if your blowers are messed up and not
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you need them to be, if you can't
correct it, I understand you're growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd rather have it too dry than too
moist if you've got the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also remember to keep your air fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want stale stuffy air in your
grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants need plenty of CO2 and they
deplete the CO2 in a room very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having stale air in a grow room can lead
to powdery mildew and it slows down the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of your plants quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep my vegging plants under 24 hours
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they grow more quickly under 24
hours of light than they do with the dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most books will tell you to run a 16 hour
day period and an eight hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great because it's how nature
works and you can't argue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've experimented with both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I'm running a seed crop,
I will run a 16 hour light cycle and then
[SPEAKER_00]: go to a 12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will run an 11-13 cycle,
which is odd, but we'll talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 16-8 light cycle is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's how nature works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also lets your equipment cool down and
take a little bit of a break and it lets
[SPEAKER_00]: your electricity bill chill out for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets your meter quit spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as your vegging plants are
under 16 hours of light every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: they should be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do another show with more info on
light cycles and photo period later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I've really noticed is that when
I flip my plants to 12-12 to flower from
[SPEAKER_00]: this 24 hour light cycle, they show flower
faster than the plants that had a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just one thing I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're really looking for a
production crop, that's something to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I just remembered that that's kind
of what inspired that for me, I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: might switch back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like to keep my mother plants
under 12-12 just to keep them from even
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that they may have the chance to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get root-bound and stuff,
sometimes some of your mother plants may
[SPEAKER_00]: try to auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our babies in new pots and we
fed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're under good lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a fan lightly blowing over the
canopy to keep the air circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the temps and the humidity are
correct in the room, the plants won't need
[SPEAKER_00]: water for three or four days if you
watered them enough right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good time to start thinking
about pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have neem oil on hand, give each
plant a good spray when the light turns
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray them when the
lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That creates what I call little reflector
bubbles from the, you know, the bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: land on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light hits it just like a magnifying
glass did when you were a little kid and
[SPEAKER_00]: used to cook ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll happen to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow light will work as the sun and
the bubble will work like a magnifying
[SPEAKER_00]: glass and you'll get a little burn mark,
a little white spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray when the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always try to spray it when the lights are
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's any book will tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem will keep most of your pests away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're in flower, you'll need to
rethink the neem because you do not want
[SPEAKER_00]: to spray neem on your flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll taste terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make concentrates with neem sprayed
plants, oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make concentrates with neem sprayed
plants, you can definitely taste the neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you're in flower, stop spraying
neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a new product I'm testing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works for me, I'm definitely going
to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was recommended to me by somebody in
the horticulture industry, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, so it's used for food
crops, so it's completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell bad when I used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of testing it out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're now officially in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using bottled nutrients,
I only feed them once per week with plain
[SPEAKER_00]: pH water throughout the rest of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally feed all my plants on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are listening to this on
Monday, I'm probably waiting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower room comes on at 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll click on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will actually have my nutrients mixed up
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start doing that about 9.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these plants are in, they're going
to start week five today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start mixing up their week five
stuff, get the pH adjusted in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll throw some air stones in
there and let that stuff just bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: around and let the nutrients mingle for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as lights come on,
I'll go in there and feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll need the water again, usually by
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get heavier into flower,
it may step up to Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't go as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about how tall you can let your
plants get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you got to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how tall your plants can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about if you want to top them or let
them grow naturally, because your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sativa plants can double in size
during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're growing the bounty killer,
that thing is going to double in size
[SPEAKER_00]: during your flower period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to think about how tall and
wide your plants can get before you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower them out, because that is going
to be the next major phase of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let them veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably got another month to 45,
maybe two months if you want to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recommend about 30 days veg time
from here out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn them with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that gets us basically started
through the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to go in depth with each of these
little topics in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make little branches from everything
that I've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get everybody up to speed with
the basics before we go too deeply into
[SPEAKER_00]: specific stuff about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got tons of information to share with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more details on anything I
mentioned, please just ask me because I
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to elaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook me at iGrowCulture on Facebook or
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer almost anything you ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to just interact with my social
media people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that was a lot of talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to freshen up my throat here,
probably take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be right back and we will see
what else we got for this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I'm going to wrap the
show up right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tend to listen to more of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put out a 30-minute episode,
it gets a better response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_00]: search for iGrowCulture, find the review
section, give me a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, type in a little comment and
let me know what you think of the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will read your comments on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.am, and also every
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is available on
iRegeneticsColorado.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably have more grow lessons for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jesse is getting married, so he won't
be back for a couple of weeks to do an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, but he will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys that keep tweeting me and
asking me, where's Jesse?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's planning a wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to give him some time and some
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He belongs to his wife now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is not ours anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on the wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not for another week, but it's
coming up and we're proud for you.
