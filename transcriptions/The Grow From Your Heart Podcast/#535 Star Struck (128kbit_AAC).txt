[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start with some nasty,
potent, gross oranges, maybe oranges and
[SPEAKER_00]: armpits coming out of here right when I
open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I take a dab, I was overwhelmed
by orange and citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mouth was loaded up with orange turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, that is when that
garlic kind of kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just lingers on the tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you smoke it, you have, it sort of
tastes like you ate orange garlic chicken
[SPEAKER_00]: or orange garlic tofu if you're a hippie,
but it's got that orange garlic,
[SPEAKER_00]: General So flavor to it.

[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who supports

[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not supporting the show and you
would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big thank you to everybody who
has continued to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I did receive a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a cannabis
culture or cultivation question that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like me to answer on the show,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email for today's episode goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Ross DeGeoff, I listen to a
lot of podcasts on similar subject matters
[SPEAKER_00]: and you are the best speaking voice in
terms of pronunciation, thoroughness,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's a correct word, and you are the
best speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And truly making points of a clear
understanding details for your audience to
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails from people saying
they cannot fucking stand the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool with me because I try to
speak very clearly so that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like that I make too
many pauses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that honestly is for editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to edit a short pause
instead of editing a long run on sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: where when I'm talking and talking that
then there's a new sense and it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird skip and edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of pauses do allow for some
easier editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think it's easier for people to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of pauses make me think of my
talking speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get really carried away and talk
really fast if I don't take some breaths
[SPEAKER_00]: and pauses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pauses are for all of us to get
along a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the teaching better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if people don't like the
pauses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good part is this person really enjoys
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that I speak well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think I speak clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got thoroughness, if that's even
a real word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do sometimes try to look at a subject
from multiple different angles because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that people learn from way different
styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have to actually put their
hands on something to learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have to learn it like in a
creative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have to learn it in a real
analytical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to approach teaching in a way that
everybody can learn because I really love
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame that on our friends at
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love to learn but I did not like
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting there for hours at a time having
somebody drone on about some bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really bored me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had creative teachers who engaged
and didn't just stand in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: class at a board and write shit on a board
if they gave us activities, I noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: I excelled and enjoyed that class better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal is to try to teach in a way
that I can keep people focused and
[SPEAKER_00]: entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm kind of a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell some jokes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like those nuggets of funny are
like little rewards for all the learning
[SPEAKER_00]: your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn, learn, learn, laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn, learn, learn, laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps us all function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm fucking stone and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that I try hard to
teach in a way that everybody can
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I find so many
broadcasters come across mumbly-ish or
[SPEAKER_00]: they repeat silly phrases like you know
what I'm saying or they say like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do say like too many
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do catch myself saying catchphrases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I've got all the
catchphrases at the start of the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to say you know what I'm saying
and like and shit like that because that
[SPEAKER_00]: drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knew what I was saying I wouldn't
have to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what I'm saying is no I don't
know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking language is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate it when people speak
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that I try hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also goes on to say not only do I and
others take your show more seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: because of your professional sounding
approach in detail but also the good vibes
[SPEAKER_00]: of sharing and caring you put through
shines through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man thank you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that speaking well shows that my
brain is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fucking put some thought into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's the part that I really
like their professional sounding approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just recently started doing videos and I
could see my smiling face and see that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that good vibes come
through on a recording that wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a moment ago I try to be kind of
funny and tell jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fucking witty funny dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of I like to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun is important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not having fun with the fuck you
haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you get the good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to know that that is conveying
in a recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'm passing that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that I'm when I'm editing I'm
not looking for good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you sound like a good vibe that's not
on my list of shit to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that that's coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling but I promise we will get to
the point of this podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have so much time so we've got to
get there eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says I have one request.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do an episode on your varieties
Space Force and on starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were freebies I recently received
through Oregon elite seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all that you create created
and continue to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up from Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filled with compliments specific
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let me know why you like the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what I'm doing right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me that the vibe comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you set me up for a really good
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked about two strains that I've
created called Space Force and starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well my friend I'm going to highlight both
of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do two separate episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again excuse me for the throat clearing
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit that because
we're doing video now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to keep rolling through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to clear my throat a lot of
times because I took some fat fat dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to do two back to back
episodes here that are going to be strain
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel if I do both of these strains in
one episode the information will get
[SPEAKER_00]: convoluted and people's brains will mash
the details up into one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to do two separate episodes to
do the two strains for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to keep shit straight for you and for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode we are going to review
a strain which I created called
[SPEAKER_00]: starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it starstruck
starstruck is a strain I created.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the parents of starstruck
starstruck was bred from star dog star dog
[SPEAKER_00]: female to an arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the star dog first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Star dog is a cross of Kim for and Tres
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can tell it's already got a lot of
dog dominant genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Kim for is one of my favorites to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love the Kim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did grow the Tres dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't my favorite to grow in a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't get it just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't grow just right for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give you problems if you
overwatered overfed if you pissed it off
[SPEAKER_00]: in any way instead of making one giant
cola up the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would do one stick with a little
popcorn but on one side and then a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up it it would do another popcorn but just
a few golf balls up the main branch that
[SPEAKER_00]: main cola would never fill in if you
pissed it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the Tres dog Kim for grows
like a fucking savage Kim for is really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like a champ does a lot of great
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really bug resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Kim for the aroma the flavor the
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is Kim for to the Tres dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really it got my attention as a consumer
because it's got a really good gassy
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some earth to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say that strains have certain
aromas and flavors you have to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that different growers in different
environments are going to get different
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take this star dog cut and put it
in seven grows and we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: seven different flavors but they are all
going to have this base of a gassiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gassy and skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I noticed that when I grow it in
a commercial facility with new millennium
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients I do find a little bit of
strawberry or watermelon hints to the
[SPEAKER_00]: after flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the start is gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of feet and feel to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you inhale and then as you exhale
there's this this strawberry watermelon
[SPEAKER_00]: turp to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's in my brain is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see flavors and colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really soft pink color and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bubblegummy but it is watermelony
and strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my crazy brain description of
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gassy with hints of watermelon and
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype that I grew the grow that
I'm familiar with lots of gas hints of
[SPEAKER_00]: feet lots of watermelon and strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the things that got my
attention and it gets me so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a really desirable high good
head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my eyes heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me think like some some weed some
concentrates go to your body some
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates give you cotton mouth some go
right to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one hit me in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes and in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was high like I wasn't stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke stardog I actually get high
and I smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a little bit to get me really
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's that chem for the Tres
dog that chem family stuff gets to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love the buzz when you grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of trichomes a lot of
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start popping up early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They coat the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get really thick on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stardog makes great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms makes a stardog batter
that if they've got a four gram jar of it
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take it every time it's on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that stardog batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes a lot of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog has a really good structure except
for sometimes if it doesn't get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light if you don't have enough wind the
bottom branches will grow sideways instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start going horizontally instead of
vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to get out to the end of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go up so they can get away from
the rest of the branches and get that
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes if you don't have enough
light it can be a little bit of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it's an amazing grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good to grow in my opinion in
a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing stardog if I had if I had to get a
bonus if we were kind of if we had an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue in the previous grow stardog is how
I would make up for it in the next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted to get a bonus if we wanted
to fill a room with something we knew
[SPEAKER_00]: would kick ass if we had a 420 sale coming
and we needed a lot of product fill a room
[SPEAKER_00]: with stardog it will please you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a lot of quality product and
it's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make you don't make mistakes
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's forgiving is what I think I'm trying
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a mistake it will bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overwater it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overfeed it and it won't be too
pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good for commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kicks out great lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency the turps are always great and
the labs it never ever had any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got amazing bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shapes of the buds are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice and dense but not too dense
to where the bags look small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put it in a jar and put it on the
shelf the colors the bag appeal the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: people want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see that lab test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: High 20s low 30s and the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really found stardog to be an excellent
commercial strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell I grew it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial grow guys couldn't mess it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had plants in that commercial grow like
the trez dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could kill that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stardog it would just survive through
everything if they messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love growing the stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make bonuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a growing flower and a smokers
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a commercial cultivator's best
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could grow a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would put out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it hit the shelf it would
disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took my male Arise plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a male Arise plant known as King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to my podcast a lot you've
learned all about King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon is a very unique selected
male cultivar of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is golden goat to day breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat is island sweet skunk Hawaiian
sativa and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day breaker is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that without looking at my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a really tropical sativa
dominant type of a plant and I pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: or that was pollinated by an OG kush chem
dog combination plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had tropical sweet flavors and those
dank stanky skunky earthy savory flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed that and that made Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an Arise phenotype that is known
as Arise number four because it was number
[SPEAKER_00]: four in the garden that tests very high in
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Miles in New Mexico grew out in
Arise plant and he tested that plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: 35.84% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is known to put out amazing lab
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high THC results.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I use the male Arise plant everything
I pollinate with that plant becomes better
[SPEAKER_00]: than it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't anything wrong with the
stardog plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought that by pollinating it with
my Arise plant that I could probably make
[SPEAKER_00]: something bigger, faster and better
because that is what it is known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I mostly hit my goal except
for too many phenotypes of this cross are
[SPEAKER_00]: just remakes of the stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of them, a lot of them come out
just like stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make anything too different.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are stardog dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they grow a little bit more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are stardog with sweeter
flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, I like what I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it kicks ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was trying to do something new and
it mostly came out like one of the parent
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, which I understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the genetics, if you look
at King Solomon, there is Chem D in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's ChemDog in King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ChemDog in the stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Chem4.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's TresDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Chem happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all already kind of put together
all of my ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already tasted like chem, looked and
smelled like chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it came out very chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do get a lot of trichome
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a lot of hypervigour and I do get
some really unique phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more about
starstruck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcome was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great commercial plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a better commercial plant than the
stardog was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes larger buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes flower longer,
but some of the phenotypes flower more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for a great
commercial plant and you can't get your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on the stardog or you want something
different, the starstruck would be perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very bug resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that many phenotypes do not
get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts out really big fat friendly
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said earlier, it is great for
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just need to put out fat weight,
this is the plant for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromas are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's very much like stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got so much chem going on in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Joseph OG that it's got that
gassy feet thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a lot of the phenotypes because of
the golden goat side of the arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get that sweetness in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get that watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get some strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even get some sort of grapefruit sort
of turps coming out of some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of really cool phenotypes,
but again, most of them are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: stardog dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why I'm just going to drop
this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I discontinued making
starstruck seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still starstruck seeds
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say it, don't stutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dare you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are starstruck seeds still available
at many vendors, but I will not be making
[SPEAKER_00]: them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because I didn't do anything too
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out very stardog dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are plenty of other breeders out
there working with stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog is not a cross I made that was
made by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let that breeder work with that and
do that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, for some reason, it never took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I advertised it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just never really went anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure after this episode comes out,
a few more packs will move.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know how some strains really
gain traction and some really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they're hitters or they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the starstruck, nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I advertised it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be discontinued to make
room for things that maybe somebody will
[SPEAKER_00]: be interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make room for new art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think being a breeder, I'm kind of an
artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you might want to call me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get rid of that old artwork and
work on a new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stardog will go bye-bye so that we
can work on new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't need to make more stardog
crosses when there are plenty of breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: out there making plenty of stardog
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that made stardog has plenty of
outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let him have his plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to step on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much like stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavors, gas, strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes smell like feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them get that rubber tire smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that chem dog dominant
crosses have a tire shop sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many hours you spent the
tire shop, but the next time you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: your tires change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what those tires smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes it smells like new generic
shoes, not good shoes, but like good,
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like good, new, cheap shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them smell like fresh tennis
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've ever opened a can
of tennis balls and smelled that weird
[SPEAKER_00]: smell that comes out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a rubbery chemical sort of a
smell, but some of the phenotypes will
[SPEAKER_00]: have that aroma to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the buzz that comes
from starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked earlier how I love the buzz from
starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take a dab from starstruck,
I feel my eyes just go, it's like somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: just pushed a button to close the garage
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes get real heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get real bright red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a nice buzz from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get like, I don't know, it does
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of concentrates make me normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one doesn't make me normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucks me up and that's what I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll give me the giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get that weird grin.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have been smoking a long time,
it takes you a minute, but once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you get that fucking silly grin on
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog will give me that stupid grin,
that stoned grin that like, what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know, but I'm just fucking
smiling, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just stoned and it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed if I smoke too many dabs of
the starstruck, I can time travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get into a little bubble and I can
come out of that bubble and it's been the
[SPEAKER_00]: full day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also in that little bubble,
I may have like completely rearranged the
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how well I rearranged it,
but I did it completely rearrange the
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I organized all my seed packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I tuned up the whole drum set,
but it really, it can put you into a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble if you smoke too much of the
starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk more about the growth
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about growing this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part where all the growers are
going to want to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starstruck can take heavy feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes to be fed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plants in this cross are very
heavy feeders, so she can take a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in flower, she will want extra cow
mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes topping, popping, twisting,
and abuse very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to twist her, pop her,
hold her down, put it in a screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a tomato cage, anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take all of that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also this plant clones very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that most of the time the
starstruck clones root a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly than some of the other clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also resistant to bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pump up the CO2, this plant will
continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I really
crank up the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to tell you the numbers
that I hit because some of the management
[SPEAKER_00]: may hear, and they will not be happy at
how much CO2 I'm cranking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go fucking crazy, and the stardog
plants love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The starstruck plants go fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stardog, starstruck loves the fucking
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will need some help and some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that about many of the crosses that
I breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that comes from King Solomon is
going to need support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think these plants will hold
themselves up, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will need sticks, tomato cages,
or trellis, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get big fat buds from the
starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants do stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say expect double the height
by the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these plants are going to have
that classic Christmas tree structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, some of the bottom
branches are going to stretch out really
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontally and try to get away from the
branches above them to where they can get
[SPEAKER_00]: more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to do some defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants take very well to
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out those extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that light down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help you minimize the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, crack, pop, and twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two weeks of flower,
that will definitely help slow down that
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive stretching that you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may double in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do like a pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between 6.2 and 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: They handle temperature swings very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this plant in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the starstruck and the star dog,
both in commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both handle temperature swings very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in a commercial environment,
there are always equipment failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get to learn what good
plants take the temperature problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we learned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got good experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it will take temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about some of the
phenotypes that you're going to find when
[SPEAKER_00]: you are growing starstruck plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, like I keep saying,
they look mostly like star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a super thick branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a really wispy branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A medium-sized main apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get long branching on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get Christmas tree shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottom branches just want to stretch
out so they can get the light because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're being blocked from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of growing straight up,
they grow completely horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they get past the branch above
them, then they curve up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got that classic Christmas tree
shape to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see some thin-leaved freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is coming from the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably from the island sweet
skunk or the Hawaiian sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not my favorite phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have that gassy funky flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start getting a little bit more sweet
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those do have more of a psychedelic head
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get those longer lasting plants,
those are more of a psychedelic head buzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: although they are not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing starstruck, I probably want
the one that looks a little bit more like
[SPEAKER_00]: star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a whiter leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like a maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the Canadian flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the leaf I'm looking for when I'm
growing star dog or starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that star dog dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the commercial grower's dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those skinny leaves are going to be more
sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely going to get stretchier
and get much taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't keep those around if you choose to
keep that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go about 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will enjoy it, but I prefer the bigger
leaf phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get these bigger leaf phenotypes,
you're going to have to defoliate and
[SPEAKER_00]: control the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get large leaves that will block
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull that off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing purplepedials,
get that leaf off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem if you get the
purplepedials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of the phenotypes will get
really large leaves that just droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't go up no matter how much you
water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those big, super big leaves are
going to droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait that comes from
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker makes giant leaves,
and some of the phenotypes, they just hang
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so big that they can't support
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can defoliate those if they are in the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these plants are going to get
stinky really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that start putting off a water
melon turb early, that will turn into fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: and feed later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes fast, so be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to flip early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to flower a week earlier than
you do with most of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not taking out that main apical
top, these plants are going to get tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe flower a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are going to flower
in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find 10-week phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 63, 65-day phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is perfect for a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 10-weeker will get tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some more dense, tighter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the star-struck, star-dog dominant
phenotype that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some airier, fluffier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one I don't keep, but that is
also the one that's going to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tighter blood plant will probably go
about nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will go 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That airier, fluffier one, the stretchy
one, that little bitch can go 10 or 11
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never let it go long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut it down, I get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what I wanted from this
project, so it just gets removed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to grow a golden goat dominant
plant, I would grow golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I removed that little bitch from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seed line is discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to pick up seeds just
because I don't make them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that I don't make it because the
first fact is nobody is buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make seeds that aren't going to
sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, there is somebody making
plenty of stardog crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want something that is a
stardog cross, cross to a rise that has
[SPEAKER_00]: got the potential for really impressive
THC numbers, I can almost promise you that
[SPEAKER_00]: you will find a 32 or higher percent THC
plant in these seeds if you search through
[SPEAKER_00]: it, if you've got access to a lab,
if you grow properly, if you give these
[SPEAKER_00]: things all of the love and care they
deserve, you'll get 32% THC out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype of star strobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that and higher from stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that and higher from a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know together they will beat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see your lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's all I've got for you
guys when it comes to starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that it's great for
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a commercial grow and you
want to put some iry genetics in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put some starstruck and some
strawberry starburst in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have two wonderful flavors and
aromas and you would kick ass and reach
[SPEAKER_00]: your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could figure out a third strain and see
what fits your palate and your customer's
[SPEAKER_00]: desires and we'll get your grow all loaded
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a private grower, you want
something that grows giant buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you love that gassy funky watermelon
strawberry aroma, starstruck may be the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for you.
