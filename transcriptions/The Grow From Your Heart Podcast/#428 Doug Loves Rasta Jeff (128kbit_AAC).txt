[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu
Pure Kush full spectrum extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this product
contains 85% THC and 98% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate has me super stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I buy a product that
makes me kind of high, more of an upy,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a brain mixing kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate has got me on slow
motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting back in the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm talking super slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I tried to play music,
my quarter notes would be super wide right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
I do have a great podcast lined up for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.

[SPEAKER_00]: And again, big thank you to everybody who

[SPEAKER_00]: in the present, and in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got a lot of fun stuff to
talk about in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been listening to this podcast
for a while, you know that I am a huge fan
[SPEAKER_00]: of comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love standup comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to see live comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have built friendships with several
well-known, people may call them famous
comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also established and developed a
relationship with my favorite club,
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are one of the top three,
probably the top two comedy clubs on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet, in my opinion, only rivaled by the
Comedy Store in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just because all of the famous
comedians live in Hollywood and or the LA
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, ComedyWorks is my favorite comedy
club on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to see live comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hanging out at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat me like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is designed beautifully for comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a small room for a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thing that happens when you see
comedy in a large venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedian will tell his joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll say his punch line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll be like, and that's when I
punched him in the dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the crowd will laugh and the
laughter will go from the front to the
[SPEAKER_00]: back, all the way to the back,
up to the balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then somehow that laughter sweeps back to
the comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back across the balcony from the
back of the room, back up to the front of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in the front laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They applaud a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people do that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sign that you give when you're
done laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, ha, ha, ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the comedian has to wait for that to
be able to tell his next if it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: tagline or if it's a whole nother bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of patience and a lot of
time between jokes and between sentences
[SPEAKER_00]: in a big comedy venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I really enjoy about
ComedyWorks is how intimate the place is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceiling is very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seats are close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the club holds less than 300 total
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're in there, the vibe is
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually put your phones in a bag
that you cannot open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like a little like that
shoplifting thing at the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run it through a little thing
to get the tag off your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put your phone in a little bag that
has a tag like that on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your phone is locked up during the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use your phone,
you can walk out to the lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will undo your phone and you can use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love that everybody has their phones
locked up in these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're in the showroom,
it is nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in ComedyWorks, what I love about it is
they tell a joke and the laughter hits the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laughter explodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the comedian can throw in his next
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he says like, so I kicked him in the
dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if the crowd laughs and he goes
and then he dropped his change or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, I don't know what the joke is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you throw out, there's always that
one more line that you want to throw just
[SPEAKER_00]: to make people chuckle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't get lost in a small comedy
club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoy that atmosphere,
that environment of a tiny comedy club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm rambling about is I really
enjoy the atmosphere and environment of
[SPEAKER_00]: the downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on Sunday, I was headed to see Doug
Benson record his live taping of his
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast called Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson has a podcast that is kind of
a movie game show, a movie trivia game
[SPEAKER_00]: show type of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a show where he hosts the show and
he brings three guests, usually actors,
[SPEAKER_00]: comedians or somebody local that people
will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he invites them on stage to
participate in games.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a prize bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each person who is a guest on the show is
expected to bring a small prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't expect anything serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often, the people don't know they
need to bring a prize until they're on
[SPEAKER_00]: their way to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they stop at some weird gift shop or
sometimes Target or whatever is close and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just get random shit and put it in
the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just more fun than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's usually a prize bag played for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are nametags.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in the audience will design
nametags.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nametags are usually they're supposed
to be designed after movie poster spoofs
[SPEAKER_00]: where you in insert your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people get really creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for a good example, in the past,
I have used Rasta Jeff Strikes Back as my
[SPEAKER_00]: nametag movie poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just put my name right there over or
my face right there over Luke Skywalker's
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got my smiling face with my
backwards hat, my dreadlocks hanging down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I look like Luke Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my lightsaber going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to fuck some shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is Rasta Jeff Strikes Back is my
nametag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of the people in the audience
get very creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of Doug's guests are cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they love candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people will attach candy or
cannabis related products to their nametag
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage their nametag to be selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The contestants come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about their prize bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put their prizes in the prize bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they select a nametag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are playing for somebody in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they win the games, the person whose
nametag they selected will win the prize
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the celebrity or the comedian or
this guest doesn't walk away with the
prize bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually playing for somebody in
the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That encourages the audience to bring
nametags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really fun, interactive,
kind of a culty sort of a podcast sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug has a really tight following.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some really inside jokes that
are really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a Doug Loves Movies taping
and you're not sure what's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be some really funny random
audience interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say certain words, Doug will reply
with certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you say certain words,
the audience will reply with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain cues at the start of the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain cues at the start of the
show that Doug expects you to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people improvise on those and it
makes it even funnier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that is the gist of the Doug
Benson live taping.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings out three guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show their prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They select nametags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a game portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play games.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the madness and the
comedy ensues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was headed to Denver on Sunday,
which was Mother's Day, to go see the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional annual Mother's Day taping of
Doug Loves Movies at the Downtown Comedy
[SPEAKER_00]: Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about an hour into my two hour drive
on my way to Comedy Works and my phone
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrated and I noticed that I had a
message on Twitter from our friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked up my phone, gave it a quick
look and it said, are you ready to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: guest on a full episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to jump to conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to get too excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set my phone down and continued
driving for a few moments until traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: got really clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get into the right lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could hand my phone over to the person
in the passenger seat and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, does that say what I think it says?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she read it, she said,
he's asking if you want to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought to myself, that can't be what
that says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in me said, don't get too
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what that says.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I messaged him back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you mean like on the panel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, dude, I want you to be
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to be a full guest on the Doug
Loves Movies podcast at my favorite comedy
[SPEAKER_00]: club on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think I believed it until I
was on the stage and sitting to my right
[SPEAKER_00]: was Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my left was a comedian known as Taylor
Tomlinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to her left was a comedian called
Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as everybody started talking,
I was like, hey, I'm on the Doug Loves
[SPEAKER_00]: Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly I felt really comfortable and I
felt really at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about how the day went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a good parking spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I got kind of lit in the
parking lot because I had to calm myself
[SPEAKER_00]: down before I headed up to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked up to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got myself situated in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Miss Amy with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought her with me as my date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to be sure to find her a good,
comfortable seat and make sure that she
[SPEAKER_00]: was well taken care of while I was on
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't just abandon her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to make sure she was comfortable and
that they knew she was my girl and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were taking good care of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got her all set up with my friends at
the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they took me to the green room
where I ran into Jeff Tate and eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out and smoked a little bit
because that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went back to the green room,
I ran into Taylor Tomlinson and her
[SPEAKER_00]: fiance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a long, funny conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, Doug Benson and his girlfriend
and Jeff Tate all stumbled into the green
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out for a few right before
showtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all stepped out of the back door of
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taylor Tomlinson did not consume any
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did not join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Jeff Tate, Doug Benson and myself
all out back smoking a little reefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not snitching on anybody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows those guys are potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I want to make sure nobody
thinks Taylor was back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was not smoking with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know her stance or position,
but she did not consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get her in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all went and got stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Doug goes and starts the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug does a few minutes of his own time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess Doug did about 10 or 15,
maybe 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes out and gets the crowd warmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a few advertisements, talks about
shows he's got coming up, talks about the
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he brings out the guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought out Taylor Tomlinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He introduced me as Rasta Jeff and of
course, Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt really fun to walk out and
just sit on the stool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few people knew who I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few people seemed to know who I
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really fun just to be on the
stage with Doug Benson, who is kind of my,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only hang out once or twice a year,
but he knows who I am obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really comfortable just to be
chilling next to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Tate is one of my favorite guests on
that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to every episode of that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play along with the games.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of my favorite podcasts to
listen to when I am in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the earbuds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to listen to the games and have
a good time and participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Tate is one of my favorite guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he is fierce competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the games, he is known for winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only a couple other guys that
have a better reputation for taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: games than him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really fun to be on the show
with Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taylor Tomlinson was really sweet and
really fun and really nice and really
[SPEAKER_00]: inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in the green room with her,
it didn't feel like I was in the green
[SPEAKER_00]: room with some famous comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like I was just hanging out with
some people that I had just met.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all just chilling out, having a good
time, doing a little show together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got comfortable on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all introduced ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug gave me a moment to talk about my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to talk about my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned the prize bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it is Colorado, I was able to put
two packs of seeds into the prize bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I threw a 10 pack of Arise into that
prize bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also threw in a 10 pack of Sonic
Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that the guy who won will
ever grow those, but I got to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: them on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of fun conversation at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some jokes about my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taylor Tomlinson called me the stoner
Tarzan, which I thought was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that one, she said it was a compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is just adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything she says I take as a
compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after a few jokes, after a few
minutes, we got to the game portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been listening to the Doug Loves
Movies podcast for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have attended probably 10 or 15 live
tapings of that show, but I do not watch a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really questioning my ability to
do well in the movie based trivia games.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to brag too much here on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did pretty damn well for not knowing a
whole lot about movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've already talked a whole lot
about the episode, but I hope you guys go
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to Doug Loves Movies episode 1172.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Taylor Tomlinson, Rasta Jeff,
and Jeff Tate as guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is live from ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it is the second episode in the
feed and it came out Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were on iTunes or Stitcher,
you should be able to find that pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Doug Loves Movies podcast
episode 1172.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to listen to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how well I did on the games,
but also see how much fun I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the time of my life on that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did not expect to be a guest on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find out until my way to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was unprepared, but I think that was
best because I just walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, cool, go back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went into the green room and they're
like, cool, let's go on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all just happened super smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I don't think I
realized it was even happening until I was
[SPEAKER_00]: on the stage and it was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't think it hit me that it
had happened until Monday when the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, wow, I was on that podcast
and I got to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it I really didn't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it started happening, I was like,
oh, I do remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was such a blur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much adrenaline, so much
excitement and so much laughter that I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't even pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe a big, huge thank you to Doug
Benson for letting me be on his Doug Loves
[SPEAKER_00]: Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I owe a big, huge shout out to all
of my friends at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have always treated me like a rock
star.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always treated me like a VIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I was a guest on the show and I
was actually backstage, I was treated like
[SPEAKER_00]: a celebrity and that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to all my friends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after the show, there was an amazing
little smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say allegedly there may have been a
smoke session in the alley behind
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks with Doug Benson, Jeff Tate,
myself, and probably 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all congregated out behind ComedyWorks
out by the dumpster there because that
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be the classy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we smoked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And took pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of awkward because a lot
of people asked me to sign autographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not used to that yet, but it is really
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, it is super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me that people were
excited to shake my hand and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were like, dude, you're funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even realize I was saying
anything funny on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying not to say anything
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for everybody to be complimenting me
and be super excited to meet me and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weirdest part of signing
autographs, I'm still not I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ever get used to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always down to take a picture and
shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But signing autographs feels really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that will ever feel like a
natural thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a great time being a guest on the
Doug Loves Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of great people after
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I laughed at.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as Amy and I walked up to the
comedy club, there were there was a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: standing in front smoking a cigarette and
they saw me and the guy looked at me and
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, hey, dude, are you a guest on the
show tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I was supposed to tell
anybody that I was a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, I didn't know what to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, I don't think I'm supposed to talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he laughed and he introduced himself
and we had a fun conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him, his wife and Amy and myself hung out
for a few minutes, just hanging out for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few in front of the comedy club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit early and he was early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was smoking a cigarette and I was
just chilling out, kind of catching the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeze and enjoying the sunshine before I
went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought it was really funny that he
knew who I was and he asked if I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Doug tries to keep it a
secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't sure if I was supposed to say,
yeah, I'm on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, I don't know how I'm supposed
to react to that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he knew by my reaction,
but I didn't snitch on myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the smoke out after was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting everybody was a really great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize that I was going to
shake hands with everybody at ComedyWorks
[SPEAKER_00]: that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to Doug again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Jeff Tate and Taylor
Tomlinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I owe a big shout out to Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Amy to that comedy show as my date.
[SPEAKER_00]: She thought she was going to go and hang
out with me and sit next to me and hold my
[SPEAKER_00]: hand through the show and look at me and
laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of ditched her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of abandoned her and I ended up on
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure that that club treated her
like a queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she got a great seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected her name tag during the name
tag portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made sure to show her that she was
getting all kinds of love, even though I
[SPEAKER_00]: was up on stage playing rock star for a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got a front row seat and I saw the
smile on her face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the drive home was super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was giddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amy had a big smile on her face because
she had just smoked with Doug Benson and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Tate and seen a great comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a big smile on my face because I got
to be on one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was a great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a wonderful evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never expected, anticipated,
or planned on being on that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So showing up and just walking into the
green room, walking onto the stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: that felt amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't think I even realized it
happened or was happening until Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: when I looked in the podcast, was live on
iTunes and I listened to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I really did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've talked for like 15 minutes,
about an hour and a half podcast that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was on, but it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to share that with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to make sure to say thank you
to the important people that deserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to Doug Benson again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Jeff Tate, Taylor Tomlinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to all of my
friends at ComedyWorks and an extra big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Miss Amy for making the night
extra perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I do have more stuff
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were still listening after I
just rambled for 15 minutes about being on
[SPEAKER_00]: a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't get bored with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to talk about how much fun I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to talk about all kinds of comedy
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten to do something like that
in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the next fun event that
is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you listen to the
Dude Grows show, you know that we have got
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows show concentration
celebration coming up on July 13th at

a lot of great companies coming out.

dabs and meet some people, if you are into

all the event info posted up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy Scotty Real for putting together
[SPEAKER_00]: this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This event started off as a kind of a
carbon copy of the original Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: cup, but we realized that we had to change
up a few things and it took a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: effort than we anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is becoming a really great event
because we had to try harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it become an even better event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to seeing you,
Scotty, the Dude Grows crew, the whole iry
[SPEAKER_00]: army and the Grow From Your Heart crew at
the Dude Grows concentration celebration,
[SPEAKER_00]: July 13th at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to segue into the next
note I have got written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next note says, tell them about your
breeding project and upcoming strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the same time as the Dude Grows
concentration celebration, I will have
[SPEAKER_00]: some new seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have Golden Goat Feminized Seeds
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have more Lemon Jeffrey Feminized
Seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to release the brand new
Orange Gasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be released live at the 710 Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be available online on 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first place you can get your hands
on it will be at the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration celebration on 713 at
Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab yourself a pack of Golden Goat
Feminized Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some Lemon Jeffrey Feminized Seeds and
check out that brand new Orange Gasm
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Orange Gasm?
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is Platinum Tangy pollinated by a
reversed Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the most ridiculous orange sweet
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like an orange marmalade,
almost like a sweet orange covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just potent and pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes big giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows super easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about eight or nine weeks to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Orange Gasm is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you find that Oh Face Fino in
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be available at the Dude Grows
concentration celebration on 713 and they
[SPEAKER_00]: should be available online at select
vendors by 710.
