[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble too much here at
the top of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to talk about selecting male
plants for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may also touch a little bit about on
selecting plants for reversals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when I take a female plant,
treat it with a solution that does make it
[SPEAKER_00]: make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen of course only makes female
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may touch a little bit about on how I
select a plant for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I select plants for breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to say a lot here is
have a goal when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a goal when it comes to
breeding, you're just pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't go into the kitchen without
some sort of goal and just pour a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit in a bowl and mix it up and hope that
it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just put plants in a room and just
throw plants in there and let them do the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you have no goal, no idea,
no path.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the same thing with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may make some good shit, but also who
knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not make some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some thought into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a clear target,
how do you know if you're hitting that
[SPEAKER_00]: target?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm saying I want to hit that dot right
there on the wall with the ball and I
[SPEAKER_00]: throw the ball, I know I hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I throw the ball and it goes way over
there, I know I need to adjust and come
[SPEAKER_00]: this way, then I can hit my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing with your breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how close you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be real with yourself and then adjust from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I'm going to recommend
in any breeding project in almost any
[SPEAKER_00]: project in life and anything you're
working on before you get started,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a goal and a desired outcome and know
what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I'm going to talk about
understanding when it comes to breeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what Gregor Mendel was trying
to teach us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good information in
Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is Google Mendel chart
or Gregor Mendel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of info will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may do an episode here on this podcast,
but there are plenty of videos about
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendel charts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendel charts will help you far in your
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will help you predict the outcome of
your breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll help you see if you're going to
reproduce something that's already been
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll help you isolate traits you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to line breeding in the
future, Mendel charts will definitely help
[SPEAKER_00]: you predict the outcome and anticipate
outcomes of your breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to learn about dominant and
recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn about co-dominant traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn a lot through Mendel charts
and through the practice of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will all make sense once you put it
into practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn about Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about dominant, co-dominant and
recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand alleles and how alleles are
expressed and passed through plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then learn which alleles you are looking
for in your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this point, you've got a good
understanding of what you want to create
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to go about creating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to touch on is select
your plants by plant appearance and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't select your plants based on names.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not breeding names just because two
plants have cool names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put those two names together,
you get an even cooler name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not mean that those plants need
to be bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not breeding names.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not breeding for social media
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are breeding biological material,
which has to work well in a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project with good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focus your breeding more on the things
you see from the plants, the things you
[SPEAKER_00]: observe and enjoy more than the hype and
the name and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will have much better success in
your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn about Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what Gregor Mendel was teaching
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then learn about dominant and co-dominant
and recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about how those traits are passed
from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand as much as you can biologically
about these plants, which we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's another huge piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you understand the Mendel charts,
the traits, the dominant, the co-dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the recessive traits, how these things
meld together when we are breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you understand that, forget all of
that and breed with love, breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: passion and grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you understand all of this stuff,
you'll be able to look at two plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: go, oh, you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, I should breed you two together
because you've got these traits and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got these traits and I see magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand a lot about music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand I can count time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can read and write music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand poly rhythms, compound time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can play with the band very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot about music.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get on stage, I do not think about
any of my musical education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play with groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play with funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play with my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that I'm matching up with the
bass player.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making sure that I'm using dynamics
when people are singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think about counting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all of that stuff is in me because
I've got a solid education about music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes time to perform,
my intuition and my heart take over and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it instinctually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you build a solid education with these
plants and a solid education about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, you'll be able to grow and breed
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just look at plants and you'll know
you'll feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you, if you listen,
the plants are already telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn about those Mendel charts,
learn about your co-dominant, learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: your dominant, recessive traits,
learn about how pollen works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things to read about
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you understand that stuff,
write down a goal, then just breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: love and grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit more in depth
about actually selecting a male plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate these ladies with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally like to start with a male
plant that is way different than the
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted female plants, which I like to
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my example would be, let's just go with
my making of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a golden goat female plant
pollinated by a data breaker male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cross was such a huge success that I
chose a male from that to base much of my
[SPEAKER_00]: seed line on for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my King Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came from that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why I chose to breed
those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat is what we like to call a
sativa dominant looking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the terminology and the words are
changing every day in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we used to call that a sativa plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got longer, skinnier leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it, you get like a crazy
head buzz that makes you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic and freaked out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows skinnier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day breaker was the complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put out giant, wide, long, droopy
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could build a carport with these
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could cover the entire house with just
a couple of these leaves and build a shade
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also grew a little bit stretchy,
kind of lanky, the complete opposite of
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat, which would get tall,
but it would keep tighter inner node
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces and more more of a compact
structure where that day breaker would get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little lanky, a little bit stretchy,
have some more space in the nodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: more like that OG Kush sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I bred them together, there was a
lot of room in the middle there for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also could see what the day breaker
male was doing to the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use a male plant that is way
different from my female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I've got opportunity to make new
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to describe it is if I'm trying to
make new stuff, I wouldn't pour chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: and more chocolate in a bowl because guess
what I'm going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put some chocolate,
maybe some banana in there and get some
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put chocolate and strawberry in the
other and get some strawberry banana
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to do things that are way
different, not two plants that are super
[SPEAKER_00]: similar in genetic variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus in on some of these
specific traits that I do look for in a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are really important to me are
plant shape and size and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this plant shaped like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep this in mind when you were picking a
male plant that is going to be 50% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome of your offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want these your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want them to make tall plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tall skinny plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Short squat plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want short inner node spacing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want longer node spacing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want plants that branch out real
far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want plants that stay in kind of
skinny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want them to grow real tall or stay
kind of squat?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of set yourself up for this
by selecting a male plant that has these
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that you are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when you start making those
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant shape, plant structure,
plant size, plant sturdiness are the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches of your male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and sturdy or are they all weak and
wispy and shitty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you breed with that weak,
wispy, shitty male, guess what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have the opportunity for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weak, wispy, shitty offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I think about is amount of
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make a lot of lateral branching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it keep going straight up?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this plant branch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the branches come out, do they make
more branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those branches make a lot of shoots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the structure I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I keep in mind when
selecting a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your main stock coming up
the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got branches coming off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far apart are those main branches
coming off the stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enter nodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there'll be a half inch apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there'll be four or five inches
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting some older tropical
shit, maybe some golden goat crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be really close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper stuff might be close
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush crosses, the presidential Kush,
there's going to be some space between
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need if you're growing in a
place with high humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want some more space in there so
you don't get big chunky buds that get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of room for humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a tropical place,
that might help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a colder, drier area,
you might be able to handle bigger nugs
[SPEAKER_00]: with more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get the humidity in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what you're breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much enter node spacing do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, flower clusters are very important
when it comes to selecting a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that big flower cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get one big top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get a bunch of flowers everywhere
that's going to show you what your male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, what your offspring is going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf shape is a big indicator of things,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf shape is how I decide how long a
plant is going to take to flower for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time that I run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got big, wide, broad leaves,
it's not going to take you more than 70
[SPEAKER_00]: days most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got those long, skinny,
tropical leaves, that's probably a 70-77
[SPEAKER_00]: day, maybe even more on the flowering side
of the plant scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size of leaves are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like those long, skinny leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like big, fat leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of product are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to play heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leaf shape and size is going to
transfer into your offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what about amount of leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like too many leaves on my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to trim all day every day,
but I need enough leaves for production
[SPEAKER_00]: and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So amount of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that male plant is just banging out
tons and tons of leaf and not a lot of bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, not a lot of flower cluster,
not building strong stems and not being
[SPEAKER_00]: even with its energy distribution,
I may not choose that male plant to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into my garden if it's super duper leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to spend a bunch of energy on
leaves and trimming a bunch of leaves in
[SPEAKER_00]: my flower product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something super
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take for that male plant
to start giving you sufficient amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take for that male plant
to flower out and make a big, giant,
[SPEAKER_00]: fat male cluster?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your male plants go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let mine go for like eight or nine
weeks, maybe 10 weeks the first time I run
[SPEAKER_00]: them to see what they are going to give
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye on that flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long until they started giving you
pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does that male plant continue to
give you pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how big did that main top get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big do those side buds get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the flowering time and
how long it does continue to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, while it's flowering, pay attention
to how tall it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a big stretch time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it do anything crazy during that
flowering phase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that because that is going to
correlate to your offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's when we get into some of the
fun, more obvious parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any colors, flavors,
aromas or visual appearances or other
[SPEAKER_00]: senses that you can use to detect obvious
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a weird thing that I'm going to
share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A weird piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a male plant that if I give it a
stem rub, if it kind of smells like vomit
[SPEAKER_00]: or bar trash can, that's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is going to be very good for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I really do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for things like colors,
aromas, flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't smoke the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one old school breeder out there
who will shake the pollen off,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry them and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do that, that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a better man than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we definitely need to pay
attention to is problems and resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this male plant react to
overfeeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it react to underfeeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: If these plants are little pussies,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to breed little pussy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want plants that can handle a little
bit of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put these plants in grow
rooms where things may go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want 100% sissy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some kind of robust, resistant
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do they handle overfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they handle underfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they handle over or underwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they take a little bit of a drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they get drowned a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I make seeds for commercial production and
for retail sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those seeds can't take some abuse,
some of my retail customers may murder the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and I wouldn't have a good
successful company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to breed with things that can
take a little bit of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about resistance to pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get any powdery mildew in that
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any bud rot?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did those male plants deal with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get any spider mites in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get thrips or fungus gnats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did those bugs go towards your male plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If those bugs and pathogens did go near
that male plant, how did that plant take
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to breed with plants that can
handle problems very well because like I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep saying, that is going to pass into
your offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've talked about the traits
I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more specifically about how
to find these male plants, which we are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the starting point is to pop
some seeds, however many seeds you've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: however many you can run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the legalities in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much space you've got,
but grow as many seeds as you can is my
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run at least one, maybe two or
three packs of seeds to find a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got one, you will find a
keeper in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that you will find a keeper
in every 10 pack of my seeds, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: you will also find a good male in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, the more numbers you've
got, the merrier, the more opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: find that outlier, that amazing stud male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I found King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, step one is to get some seeds and
germinate them, get them growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: then identify the males and the females
obviously is going to be our next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run the females in another
room, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus on
the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've germinated some seeds,
we have identified the boys and girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to move the boys to another
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to focus on
for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, let me recommend
that if you do want to repeat this
[SPEAKER_00]: process, I recommend getting clones from
these plants as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we go into flower, it is a
little bit more challenging to revedge a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant than it is a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in my experience,
it is harder to revedge the boys than it
[SPEAKER_00]: is the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend you get clones before
we do go into flower with these male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we have separated our
males and females, we've gotten clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to put these plants into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to selecting a male plant,
I generally do not choose the male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows flower very first as a breeding
candidate sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say let me start with 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I started with 10 seeds,
a lot of you are going to start with 10
[SPEAKER_00]: will germinate 10 seeds out of those 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find probably five males,
five females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually the way nature works about
50, 50, 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're going to see 60,
40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work with what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pull the females aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say at this point, we've got
approximately five male seedlings to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put them into, I'm going to
get clones like I mentioned, then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're into flower, they're going to
begin to show me the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those five, I will not choose the
first or probably even the second plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: show me that it is a male for my breeding
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason behind this is I find that that
male is probably usually most commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: going to dominate my crosses of everything
that I make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm saying is, let's just say that
that male is chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I used earlier, I use chocolate as an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use that chocolate, everything I
pollinate with that chocolate is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be dominantly chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I cross it to, like I said
earlier, strawberries, bananas,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else I cross it to, it's going to
kind of be more chocolate with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas, more chocolate with a little
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I choose not to use those first couple
of males that show me that they're male
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're just going to dominate the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be too much of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just make copies of this
male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make 50-50 crosses or somewhere
near there, and that's not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually, the first one or two plants
that show me they're males are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates which I choose for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also usually not the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the third or fourth male to
show me that it is male that I choose for
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a hint also, early in flower,
most of the plants that are male are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you they're boys because they'll
stretch up above everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be the taller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those males try to get taller so they
could drop the pollen down on the ladies,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are down below them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may give you a little bit of heads
up, something to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't choose that first guy to start
showing pollen, to start shooting his
[SPEAKER_00]: load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not the second guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the third or the fourth plant
that starts making pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my reason is because I don't want that
super dominant male, that early flower
[SPEAKER_00]: with all that testosterone, all that male
stuff going on, I don't need that going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I generally choose that third or fourth
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually not the fifth one out of a
pack of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually not the fifth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's honestly generally the third or
fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll choose the one with the shape,
the structure, the pollen time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that is closest to the traits I'm
looking for between number three and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the one that I choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we've made our selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to choose now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it comes time for you to
make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plant you're going to choose
for your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your intuition and choose that male
plant that looks the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that's going to go wrong if
you choose the wrong one is you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to go back and breed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to do it again, especially if it's
your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see what you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's awesome, fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not awesome, it's still going to
be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just may not be fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to grow and have fun with and you
learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to go and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the pressure is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time for you to select that male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want number three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want number four?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we put the plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We time it perfectly so that those plants
can give and receive pollen and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to time up those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you put the male,
you put the female in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the same day, you put them into flower
and you watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I'll put the male in the
flower room a little bit before the
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll stagger the females into
the rooms at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to figure out when your male
plant produces the most pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when your female plants are ready to
receive that pollen, when those pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: are big and ripe, looking like dandelions,
that's when they want the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time you do the cross,
you can just put them in there at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: When does the pollen happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: When does peak ripeness happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can adjust your schedule
accordingly for future runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first run, you'll get plenty of seeds
doing it just the natural way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get your male plant, get your selected
female plants, put them in the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: let the pollen happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will put that male plant in
front of a fan, let that fan blow it
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that male plant is going to pop
open those flowers and the pollen is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go moving around naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen people cut the top off and
just shake that top around to pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you choose to do it, get that
pollen all throughout that room,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate those females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's really important to let those
seeds finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run my suggested light cycle of 18
on and six hours off, or you can do 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is letting the
seeds finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then carefully harvest those seeds,
get them out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a whole other podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've done that episode before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here comes the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to grow out these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we grow these, let's talk a little
bit about why I like to pollinate multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants with one male plant in a
breeding run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I do this is because now I can
see what that male plant has contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to the breeding project to multiple
different females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I did, let's just go back to my old
chocolate analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I bred chocolate to banana,
I bred chocolate to strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just for fun we'll say that I bred
chocolate to key lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I just bred it to one, I could get
an idea of what is happening in my
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say this one came out a lot of the
chocolate traits and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's got the leaf shape of the
chocolate and the tallness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry and 50-50 chocolate and
strawberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I only have an idea of what the
chocolate plant is passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's passing that leaf structure or
whatever I attributed to the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's doing that, but is that an
anomaly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what's going to happen commonly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just one time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a recessive or a dominant trait?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do is check with other
female plants and see what traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did strawberry and I said banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did the chocolate to banana,
what was common with that strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew out the seeds from the
strawberry and the banana cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do I see which is common?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I see things coming from the male plant
like leaf shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there commonalities in the leaf shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonalities in structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the female plants look like
when we flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I need to take those traits,
identify the trait that came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: female, identify the trait that came from
the male, and learn what that male is
[SPEAKER_00]: passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to do if I pollinate multiple
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I put it to strawberry,
put it to banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what happens when I crossed it
to the key lime pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of the key lime am I tasting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I seeing that big leaf shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I seeing the skinny leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the commonalities?
[SPEAKER_00]: If in all of those crosses I get like this
weird diesel fuel aroma that I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: about, that's probably coming from the
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they all have different flavors,
that's coming from the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably that flavor trait didn't get
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we learn what the male plant
is going to do in our crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: is by hitting multiple females with it,
growing out those seeds, taking notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: observing traits, and then attributing,
oh those traits go to the male plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits go to the female plants,
and then find the commonalities in those
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, and that's probably what the male
plant is delivering to that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something that's really gonna
throw you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see shit that isn't in the
male plant or the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are gonna be traits that came from
the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that male plant didn't show you
that it had something going on in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it didn't show you that it'll put
out red leaves at week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that came from the purple Thai
plant, that it was his mom or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mom of the male plant put out red
leaves at week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know that, we didn't see that in
the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it popped up in the offspring,
so that was a recessive trait that we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't find until we bred, that came from
a grandparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see things like that in your
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to know, if I'm using plant A
and plant B, I like to know the parents of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant A and plant B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even further sometimes, I like to know
their parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing like four and then two and
then one on the family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to know that much info.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help me identify recessive traits,
dominant, co-dominant traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helps me a little bit with my predictions
in my Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just helps me to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also helps me not do too much in
breeding and double-crossing,
[SPEAKER_00]: over-crossing, back-crossing on accident,
which I do on purpose sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't want to do it too much on
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said before, I have the
best success when things are more
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross OG to OG, you just get
fucking OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross not OG, let's see something
way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say strawberries to
lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really tell you get strawberry
lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell those different flavors
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put gas and candy together,
you can tell candy, gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put gas and gas together,
you can just make more gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell what you're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going here because I do want
to touch on how, that is basically how I
[SPEAKER_00]: select a male plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have specific traits,
which I am looking for for the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have the leaf shape,
the leaf size, structure, flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma, bug resistance, pathogen
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to make the right amount of
pollen at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not the first or second male to
show me that it is the male in the bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the only way to verify that is to
pollinate, pollinate multiple plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: then grow those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for those traits that come from the
male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said, then attribute those to
the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's how you know what that
male plant is contributing to your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I select a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no magic or no voodoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use intention and I have a goal and I
use my intuition and my education to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a male that I think will reach my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the most important part is a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do want to touch on how I select a
female plant that I do want to reverse to
[SPEAKER_00]: create pollen to use for a feminized seed
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to the way that I select
a male plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has to be what I call a perfect
tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know in your criteria what plant
is a perfect tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have flavor, aroma,
buzz, the right effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a medicinal effect or a
recreational effect, it's got to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects I'm after.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have the right height,
the right shape, the right structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some of the more important stuff that
we overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a plant that waves,
hey, hey, hey, to spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a plant that goes, hey,
spider mites, fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some plants, the spider mites
won't even go near.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with those bad bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like plants that are mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been sending seeds and plants all
over the country lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am starting to learn very well what
plants do work well in certain parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are mold resistant are very
sought after for breeding, to sending
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds to each coast, the northeast
coast, the northwest coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them need very mold resistant
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find something that is mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's powdery mildew, if it's bud rot,
any of the molds out there, find a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that does not get that shit when you put
it in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find plants that are drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find plants that can be over watered,
a plant that can be drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that can be drowned a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that can take abuse and stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that can take popping, twisting,
lollipopping, defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be able to take all of the
shit that I'm going to throw at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to reversing a plant,
I need it to be a perfect 10 and I need it
[SPEAKER_00]: to have all the traits that I'm looking
for in a male plant and even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be even better than a male
plant because the females, I can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I can smoke them, I can turn them
into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke them as flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see what I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know what they're going to look
like in the female form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got to be super stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stellar plants that were 10s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I chose to reverse Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is a perfect 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a killer buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it going strong and you take
care of it, that plant thrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost can't mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pee in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could kick it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overfeed it, underfeed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could give it a drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could give it too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overheat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could freeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is just going to keep on
growing and produce badass flowers for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Golden Goat is a perfect 10 in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that I found to be a perfect
10 and somebody else agreed with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about why I reversed this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry cookies that made the turtle
line is a perfect 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a killer buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows with huge vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, you could piss in it
and it will still keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I chose the blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my third example, the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dog is a perfect fucking 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flavor, the aroma, the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is a perfect 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I chose those plants as
reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use those as your standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dog, the blueberry cookies
and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kind of plants I would
choose to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking for standards,
looking for a metric, looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: something to compare it to, those are the
ladies that I would choose that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three of my favorite plants
that I've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my three favorite reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on some things I haven't
shared with you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, the Golden Goat, the blueberry
cookies and the Grateful Dog have been my
[SPEAKER_00]: three favorite plants to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for you in my
episode about selecting males and choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: a candidate for reversals.
