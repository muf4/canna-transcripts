Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_04]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_04]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friend, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.

is our good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for taking some time away from the
rig, away from the job, and especially
[SPEAKER_04]: away from the new baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard the kid ate potatoes today.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did.
[SPEAKER_03]: First potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the baby and the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, big shout out to the wife for taking
some time and letting me come hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for taking little man, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't say your name on the show here,
but thanks to Mike's wife for letting Mike
[SPEAKER_04]: come play.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you letting me borrow your
husband for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll quit talking about babies and
we'll get on with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, thanks for jumping in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big shout out to my
friend, John Anthony Moses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're hanging out, listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, let's get into the big topic that's
been going on here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis cup was supposed to be in
Denver on 4-20.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposed to, but unfortunately,
the city of Denver declined all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver officials declined all the permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not allowed to host the event
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adams County, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, they said, nope, not going to
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had some issues, namely out of state
dispensaries handing out samples and what
[SPEAKER_03]: was supposed to be 14,000 people a day
actually being 35,000 people a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, they said, no, not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been following this one close.
[SPEAKER_04]: High times came down to Pueblo,
Colorado, where Mike and I reside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They claimed they were going to do the
festival on the 18th, 19th, 20th,
[SPEAKER_04]: 21st, within that range.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the original goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put out flyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put out some announcements on their
website.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put out some stuff on Twitter,
Instagram and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then suddenly they retracted all of
their statements and said, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: the next weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the permits have been entered.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been submitted.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being reviewed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, the city of Pueblo has not said if
they are going to allow or decline the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cup to happen in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode will come out in two or three
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty sure the decision will not
be made at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now there is no definite location
for the high times cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it does happen, it will be moved to
the weekend of the 22nd and the 23rd if it
[SPEAKER_04]: does happen in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: At all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I read something today claiming that
this move was, it was sort of an option B
[SPEAKER_03]: if Adams County didn't go through and
they'd been looking for bigger locations
[SPEAKER_03]: than the Denver Mart and the location down
here in Pueblo claims to be able to handle
[SPEAKER_03]: the 25 or 30,000 people a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not too familiar with the location.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Denver Mart was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, when I heard that it was
going to be in Pueblo, I was excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shaves a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A, a huge chunk of money out of going to
the cup for people that just want to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get a hotel room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be driving back home to
Pueblo after the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a multiple day event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go to every day just because
that's how I, if you're trying to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: all three days or have to go to all three
days, you got to be up there for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, paying top dollar for hotel
rooms right now in Denver sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every, all of the shitty hotels go
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think you're going to pay 70 or 80
for a hotel, those 70 and $80 all our
[SPEAKER_04]: hotels are now 130 on cannabis cup
weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every hotel in Denver knows that four 20
is a big weekend in Denver and they cash
[SPEAKER_03]: the fuck in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, a bunch of people have
already booked plane tickets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have booked rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have booked cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big complaint about the cup in Denver
was always that the planning was sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: like a D minus, like the roof didn't fall
in, like nobody got squashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, it was kind of a
clusterfuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when they changed their mind that
they weren't going to do it in Denver and
[SPEAKER_04]: they decided to move it to Pueblo,
a lot of people were like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck Pueblo.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo has got an interesting reputation
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we sure do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sure do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when they push the date to a
completely different weekend, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that a large portion of the people that
were going to attend just decided,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't even going to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the cup goes off in Pueblo,
because it's not at all a sure thing at
[SPEAKER_03]: this point, folks, it's the decision comes
down to the county planning department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if they decide yes, it can be
appealed by any number of people in our
[SPEAKER_03]: local sheriff has told the press that if
it's approved, he's going to appeal
[SPEAKER_03]: because he doesn't have any idea how he's
going to handle 35,000 Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_03]: attendees, not because of the number of
attendees, but because they're attending
[SPEAKER_03]: the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about the event makes it special
and uncontrollable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be too high to drive,
is what I saw in a statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really scared of dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, yeah, to the average,
to a normal person who's never seen
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and sees me pull out a torch and
heat up a nail and do this crack like
[SPEAKER_04]: looking drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand the fear, but he's a
police officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a sheriff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to figure out what's going on
with the medical marijuana community and
[SPEAKER_04]: be in touch with us and come join us
instead of be afraid of us and try to
[SPEAKER_04]: persecute us and prosecute us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spend 10 minutes talking to any member of
the community and we will cease to be
[SPEAKER_03]: scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a peaceful dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may look intimidating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may say a lot of big, crazy,
weird words, but when it comes down to it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a peaceful, chilled out dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd love to sit down and have a
conversation with anybody who needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: educated properly about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the show's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis edumacation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what today is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of hilarity, I think,
in this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at some of the reasons stated
and quoted that the permits up in Denver
[SPEAKER_03]: were denied.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two big reasons that are cited over
and over and over again in the press are
[SPEAKER_03]: a, a woman jumped out of her car,
like somewhere in or around the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cup where she had just attended or was on
her way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really specify, but like
clearly marijuana use doesn't cause junk
[SPEAKER_03]: jumping out of cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado sold almost a billion dollars
with weed last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it caused jumping out of cars,
we would know.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people have a medical marijuana
car?
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be that many people jumping out of
cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have a good bet in saying I smoke
more cannabis than 90% of the people on
[SPEAKER_04]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not an effect we wouldn't see for
years down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: If cannabis made you jump out of cars,
I would have done backflips out of buses,
[SPEAKER_04]: by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were 35,000 people a day at the
cup and one woman jumped out of a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's not exactly like event
related.
[SPEAKER_04]: They forgot to mention in the article that
she took a dab and then she went and did a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole bunch of Molly and that she drank
whiskey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've only ever heard of a chick
jumping out of a car one other time and
[SPEAKER_03]: she was stone sober and fighting with her
boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like there's a lot of not, not,
were you the boyfriend?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not, I was friends with the
boyfriend and they showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not fucking telling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's not go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, like that wasn't drug or alcohol
related.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, I can't be in this car another
minute fucking craziness longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do come to Colorado and you come
to Pueblo, if we do have the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_04]: here, please behave yourself, represent
yourself as a positive cannabis user and a
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be looking for people
driving too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the exact rule here,
but they treat cannabis like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to be leaving the cannabis
cup, have your cannabis in a sealed
[SPEAKER_04]: container.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can put it in the trunk of your
car, put your rig, your dabber,
[SPEAKER_04]: your carb cap, your torch, and especially
your product, any product you've got
[SPEAKER_04]: that's smokeable, edible, drinkable.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's cannabis infused related,
if you can rub it on your balls,
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in the trunk of the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have a trunk, if you've got
an SUV, put it in the backpack,
[SPEAKER_04]: zip the backpack up, put it way in the
back of the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have it out of reach of the driver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get yourself a DUI or an illegal
possession of cannabis ticket because that
[SPEAKER_04]: is still a possible thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This cannabis cup, if it goes off in
Pueblo, is going to be under a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, Pueblo could use a cup down here
and I'd really like to see the event do
[SPEAKER_03]: well if it gets approved at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see it do well.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big complaints in Adams County
was out of state dispensaries coming here
[SPEAKER_03]: and selling weed and dabs at their booths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them were doing donation,
legal mumble, jumbo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people were straight doing sales,
at least according to recent reports.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big no-no here, which is why none
of our local dispensaries were even
[SPEAKER_03]: handing out product at the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that the cup is supposed to be the
community gathering and celebrating and
[SPEAKER_03]: having a huge smoke out, but how you hand
out samples or what people bring to smoke,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of rules around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to know the law and please try to
comply with it as much as practicable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't fuck it up for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've worked
[SPEAKER_04]: really hard here to do this.
We've got a good thing going.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're leaving the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang out for an extra hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take a couple dabs, hang out for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went back and listened to that
episode, the one thing I realized that I
[SPEAKER_03]: meant to emphasize and didn't was the
easiest way to not get in trouble with law
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement and to be calm and cool during
those interactions is to not be breaking
[SPEAKER_03]: the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something my buddy Lewis,
shout out Magoo, he goes, you know what
[SPEAKER_04]: you forgot to fucking mention was don't
have fucking expired plates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have your tags expired.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a broken headlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a broken tail light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a cracked windshield.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said break one rule at a time was his
advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Magoo for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in a lawyer family.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't figured that out yet by
now, I don't know if you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an old lawyer joke is if you've got
to break the law, break one law at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking true.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got weed in the car and you
ain't allowed to have weed, make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the only rule you're breaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're speeding, you're asking to get
caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a fucked up car,
you're asking to get caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a lot of states, if you look like Jeff,
you're asking to get caught.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the listeners don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: This gets pointed out to me occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some listeners don't know this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people meet me or they hear my voice
somewhere and they turn around and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, is that you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I go to the grocery store
sometimes and people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, that's fucking you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I am six foot five and I've got
dreadlocks almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not even joking.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dreadlocks go damn near to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can close them in the car door.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to roll them up in the car window,
but now they're so long that that shit
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't even thought about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Testify for me, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: These fucking things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a gentle weave, they could be like a
legit hammock or blanket.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here is bigger around than my
torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've watched them steal things from other
people's hands without Jeff's knowledge or
[SPEAKER_03]: consent.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dreads will clean off a table.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work like a bullet from time to time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really long.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I need space at a concert, I just shake
the dreadlocks around a little bit and
[SPEAKER_04]: then no one wants my dreadlocks in their
face and or their beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just back the fuck up and give me
some dancing room.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, it's not that unusual to see
some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really unusual to see locks this
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, in other states, you're a
walking advertisement for a dude that's
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you should see me try to go through
the TSA going through the airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They inspect my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fucking want to squeeze them and see
what's in there, honey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, if you're coming to the
cannabis cup, be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look out at the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do a shameless shout out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since the cannabis cup in Denver will not
be on the week of on the day of 420,
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone's looking for something to do on
420 in Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a huge shout out to an
event called the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Secret Sesh will be happening at the
Gatsby Gardens in Denver, Colorado on 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do invite you to join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: For more information, you're going to have
to follow the Secret Sesh Colorado on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Search them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get a website going.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our homie, Adam Ill will be coming out to
DJ or not to DJ to host the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I can announce who the DJ
will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know who the DJ is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've got him lined up,
but I don't want to say the name of the DJ
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show here and get everybody pumped
up because it's a good DJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys will recognize his name when I
say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a fan of the podcast,
you might know who I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is not Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to cross that one off.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people might think I have Nicka T
coming to DJ an event, but we do not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get the Secret Sesh packed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have a topic for this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just going to be two high guys
taking dabs and rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friend, she calls herself that one
mountain girl, sent me a message on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram and she said, hey, you guys
should do a message about how to get your
[SPEAKER_04]: badge in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to that one mountain girl
for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, big shout out for following me on
IG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, today and today it happened to a lot
of people, but I noticed several Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: accounts got wiped the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Green and Healthy Wellness Instagram
account for the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Turpex account for their hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid to open mine right now and look
if it's even there because I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's my crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow the herb for green and healthy,
and then it's blasted by Turpex and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: all tagged in the same posts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like my time's coming on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if it disappears, I'll just
create a Rasta Jeff Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't even be iRegenetics anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be Rasta Jeff this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be the second iRegenetics Instagram
to get blasted down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just make a Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it disappears, I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to post pictures of what's going on
and interact with my friends and my family
[SPEAKER_04]: out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to that one mountain
girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, shout out to my friend Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: She kind of encouraged me to write this
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is a manager at a very prominent
dispensary in the Colorado Springs area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to her and her staff and her
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say the name of the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a mini shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a shout out, Jess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big love, big hugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jess was like, you should do an
episode because people- We had a friend
[SPEAKER_03]: doing this, going through the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought about we should do a show
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Jessica deals with people at the
dispensary every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one person a day asks how do- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike works at a dispensary too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike and Jess both have one person a
day say, how do I get a badge?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I get a badge?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I get a badge?
[SPEAKER_04]: So now all they have to do is refer that
person to this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome new listener.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you learned about the podcast by
somebody saying, hey, listen to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll learn how to get your badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Across the table is my buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to teach you how to get your
badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to open the notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says how to get your badge in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is how to get a Colorado
marijuana enforcement division badge so
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're able to work in a legal
recreational and or medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be a dispensary where you're
either rolling joints all day,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to be- There's a million
different types of jobs at dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: but be prepared to start at the bottom of
the ladder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like unless you're coming with too many
bucks, but anything you're going to do in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, you need a badge from the owner to
the bud tender, to the joint roller,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the dude who paints the walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the, the lawyer needs a badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guys that come in and build the place
have to get either real badges or visitor
[SPEAKER_04]: badges.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the people that work for the
dispensary, the grows, the processing
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities where extracts are made,
the facilities where edibles and
[SPEAKER_04]: drinkables are made, the places where
topicals are made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the testing facilities where the
cannabis is tested for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all are required to have a Colorado
marijuana enforcement division badge,
[SPEAKER_04]: which requires a thorough FBI background
check fingerprints and an intensive,
[SPEAKER_04]: intensive application process.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't meet the requirements,
you're not going to get a badge.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about the steps on how to
get this badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you want to work at a dispensary,
this is the first thing that you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really, really important if
you're thinking about moving here.
[SPEAKER_03]: To work in legal weed, know this before
you move.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one step in here that you'll need
to know and we'll get to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to get to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's one of the, I did a lot of,
a lot of research and it was one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite parts to get to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's a buttload of people who
moved here that didn't know how to do none
[SPEAKER_03]: of this and don't meet the requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they're stuck trying to get a job,
doing whatever it was they were doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: they hated so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: They moved across the country to work in
legal weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they're trying to set up a black market
grow to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're struggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing you got to do,
if you want to get a badge here in the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of Colorado, you have got to find
the application online and they will put
[SPEAKER_04]: the application in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put a link to the application.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read you the website address.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a pen and paper,
or if you want to type this into your web
[SPEAKER_04]: browser quickly, it is colorado.gov slash
Pacific, the word Pacific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.gov slash Pacific slash
enforcement slash medical dash marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: dash occupational licensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's colorado.gov slash Pacific slash
enforcement slash medical dash marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: dash occupational licensing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully somebody typed that into
their web browser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully somebody got that, wrote it
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put it in the show notes,
but that's where you need to go to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: application.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you start.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not super hard to find if you just
Google it by name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of things to filter
through though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's confusing on what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does take a minute of reading and kind
of clicking around.
[SPEAKER_03]: To find the actual application that you
need because they've got like four of them
[SPEAKER_03]: posted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're looking for either a key badge
or a support badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk about that in just a couple
of seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I made a note to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So find the application, read and review
the application.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get to a part that says this
marijuana occupational employee
[SPEAKER_04]: application form is an official document.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you provide false information on your
marijuana license application and or do
[SPEAKER_04]: not disclose all information, the
application asks your license is subject
[SPEAKER_04]: to denial or revocation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you may be subject to criminal
prosecution.
[SPEAKER_04]: The marijuana enforcement division will
conduct a complete background
[SPEAKER_04]: investigation and we'll check all sources
of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are advised that it is better to
disclose all information than face denial,
[SPEAKER_04]: revocation or criminal prosecution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys, they're not bullshitting when
they say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a guy named Tim who has been
waiting months and months for his badge
[SPEAKER_04]: because they are doing a thorough
investigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They found some stuff on his record.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're contacting the state where that
happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking to the actual judge that
resided over my friend's case to find out
[SPEAKER_04]: if he can get his badge or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He writes them letters all the time and
they reply with, we're still
[SPEAKER_04]: investigating, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Disclose your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says, if you need clarification of
any of the following questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: please contact any marijuana enforcement
division office.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means if it's not clear to you,
call them because they're happy to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you exactly what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we get into the requirements,
in a minute, like we'll get more specific,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like really just tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fudging this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't meet them straight up,
don't try cause you ain't going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do, it's a special crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the age of the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you did some shit, it's on paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just write it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't, they really don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it violates the couple of
requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they play those straight up and down
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only heard one person who didn't get
their badge and they tried to make it
[SPEAKER_03]: sound like a big conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, nah, dude, it was that
felony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's read the, uh, the
disqualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, uh, these questions go like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever discharged a sentence for a
conviction of a felony pursuant to any
[SPEAKER_04]: state or federal law regarding the
possession, distribution, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation, or use of a controlled
substance, including probation or parole
[SPEAKER_04]: within the last 10 years, even if the
conviction occurred more than 10 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means have you been in jail for
any felon?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what that means?
[SPEAKER_03]: Discharge the sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no drug felonies in 10 years is
what that question's asking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have to have completed the jail
sentence and any probation or parole at
[SPEAKER_03]: least 10 years before you apply for your
MED badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 10 years ago, you guys, if you had a
drug felony, 10 years drug felony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says drug felony.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you had to have drugs involved in
your felony and it has to be more than 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that happened, if it was nine years and
365 days, cause it's fucking leap year,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, then you're still not able to qualify.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to wait another day and then
apply.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, condition number two, have you
served a sentence, including probation
[SPEAKER_04]: parole, uh, within the last five years
upon conviction for any felony,
[SPEAKER_04]: even if the conviction occurred more than
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, if you're on probation or
parole five years ago, or within the last
[SPEAKER_04]: five years, you are not allowed to work in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no drug felonies in 10, no felonies
period in five or probation or parole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the probation and parole for many of
those felonies has to be done at least
[SPEAKER_03]: that many years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this one is neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a licensed physician making
patient recommendations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a doctor in the industry,
you can't be affiliated with a dispenser
[SPEAKER_03]: or you're involved with that part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't need a badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that that rule kind of makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really get where they're going with
the felony rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really trying to play it so that
the state can say with all reassurance
[SPEAKER_03]: that people who were dealing drugs in the
past aren't owning dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And an easy way to do that is to make sure
that anyone convicted of selling drugs
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't get to be a dispensary owner for
at least the first decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, that kind of sucks for
people who got busted back in the day and
[SPEAKER_03]: are now trying to be totally straight up
legal, but that's how Colorado wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: play it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this position part, they just don't
want you to be a doctor hanging out in a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They quashed that a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four says, have you had your
authority to act as primary caregiver
[SPEAKER_04]: revoked by the state health agency?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're, you were somebody's primary
caregiver as not under the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana type of caregiver, but as their
caregiver for somebody who is elderly or
[SPEAKER_04]: disabled, if that's been revoked,
you were not allowed to work in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question is, are you under 21
years of age?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be 21 years old when you
apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to be 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too hard to figure out 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question says are, are not
questioned, but let me take a sip here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the next question is,
but I can guess a student loans and child
[SPEAKER_03]: support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are further down the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the teaser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no, that'll come up in a little bit
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not on this list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thanks for the time to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, are you the shitty film?
[SPEAKER_04]: You were under pressure, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you the spouse or child living in the
household of any person employed by the
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado marijuana enforcement division?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if your mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: No working for both sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be a regulator and a profiteer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mom works at the MED.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have a badge.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell mom that, uh, she's got to like
disown you or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get your badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her to switch sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her to get on the right team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her to join the force.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's special rules to prevent that from
happening for a chunk of years when you
[SPEAKER_03]: join the MED now, because a bunch of
people were going to work for the MED,
[SPEAKER_03]: going through training, doing a bunch of
MED inspections for like three or four
[SPEAKER_03]: months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then getting a job at a dispensary for
like 10 times the pay, um, to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance officer because they could put
on their resume MED officer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was happening so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: The MED had to pass special, like
non-compete clause rules that they have to
[SPEAKER_03]: sign contracts when they get their job at
the MED now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and then the next one on the last one,
are you a sheriff, deputy sheriff,
[SPEAKER_04]: police officer or prosecuting officer or
any officer or employee of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: state licensing authority or a local
licensing authority?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the next, the next little,
uh, cops don't get no badges.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next little note here says stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you answered yes to any of the,
of the above questions by Colorado law,
[SPEAKER_04]: you cannot obtain or hold a Colorado
marijuana occupational employee license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are just straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get a license period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find it with the FBI background
check.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you heard, if you qualify under any
of that shit that we just read,
[SPEAKER_04]: you cannot work in Colorado in the legal
marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to go to California
or Washington or Oregon or maybe Michigan
[SPEAKER_04]: or who else is legal now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, where can people go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, other legal States, Alaska,
Washington, Oregon, DC, sorta go up there
[SPEAKER_03]: with Charlotte and Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 23 medical marijuana States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get online, look at the laws in each one,
see which ones you can still work for or,
[SPEAKER_04]: or, or what you should really do wherever
you are laws in your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: The laws better make it legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalize cannabis where you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't work in the legal industry,
that doesn't mean you can't lobby on its
[SPEAKER_03]: behalf.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Darrell.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to the podcast, I'm just
going to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, you can, you can do what you can
do for your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can't be a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can't be a manager and you can't
be an owner, but you can always be a
[SPEAKER_04]: lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be an activist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do your part in some way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after it asks, asks you all these
questions and when you check no to them or
[SPEAKER_04]: yes to them, it makes you sign and it
says, I have thoroughly read and
[SPEAKER_04]: understand the questions above and
understand that I cannot hold a Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana license.
[SPEAKER_04]: If at any time in the future, I can ever
answer yes, answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If at any time in the future, I can ever
answer yes to any of the questions above.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weirdly worded.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird, but it's, it's crazy legal
talk for if the answer to this change is
[SPEAKER_03]: like, if you committed a felony nine years
ago and two years past, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That felony conviction and all your shit
with it was over 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're good to go now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can reapply or apply period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then there's also an arrest disclosure
forum form.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it says, if since turning age 18,
have you ever been arrested, served
[SPEAKER_04]: criminal summons, charged with or
convicted of any crime regarding the
[SPEAKER_04]: possession distribution or use of a
controlled substance?
[SPEAKER_04]: You must disclose this information to the
marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you get them all on there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause oops, I forgot that one looks really
fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: They give you plenty of space to list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check any of the following or professional
licenses you have held.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it asks which licenses you've had.
[SPEAKER_04]: It asks if you've had a liquor license or
a lawyer license or a racing license,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lottery license.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to ask you a lot of crazy
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill all of this out truthfully.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So read the disqualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you qualify, then print out the
application.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fucking print it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 10 pages of paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's several pages here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you read the qualifications.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones we read you verbatim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are the automatic disqualification ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you start checking yes to some of the
ones we're talking about now, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: automatically mean a no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means you got some explaining to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first ones were no's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first ones are automatic no's.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a felony in 10 years or a felony
in five years, a drug related felony in
[SPEAKER_03]: 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a cop or I don't remember what
the last one was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cop or doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those all disqualify you right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those all dequeue you automatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only two of those that apply to
most of the people listening to the show
[SPEAKER_03]: are the first two.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think any cops listen to the
show?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope there are cops out there listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope there are law enforcement
officers listening to the show and
[SPEAKER_04]: becoming educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more I think about it, there's
probably a couple, a number of listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an event that we did for the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a live show somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: The place doesn't exist anymore,
but we did a live show somewhere and we
[SPEAKER_04]: invited people to come and I made flyers
for the show and I put out flyers for the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast to come listen to while people,
it was a smoking place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember because I used to sit in a room
with a number of members of law
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement every Monday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when this happened that I was
keenly aware of how many officers were in
[SPEAKER_03]: that room every Monday night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I put out flyers to listen to the
podcast at a smoking event and somehow law
[SPEAKER_04]: enforcement found the flyers and thought
that they were like some sort of tickets
[SPEAKER_04]: to get free weed at the event or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the next episode, I gave a shout
out to the cops hoping that they were
[SPEAKER_04]: listening because they had the flyers and
it said how to listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a little QR code.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you scanned it, it would take you to
iTunes and you could hear the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in law enforcement,
I appreciate you for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're learning the truth about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not evil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't ruin anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not that scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do understand that there are laws that
you have to enforce, but we wish that you
[SPEAKER_04]: would do what you can to change the laws
because I'm sure you see that it's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem where you are officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much respect for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So print the application.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next step here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to keep this show on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's got ADD today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Print the application, complete the
application.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shouldn't be too hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that point, obtain any court papers
that you need, any arrest disclosure
[SPEAKER_04]: forms, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got tax paper forms that you
need, if you have child support paper
[SPEAKER_04]: forms that you need, print all that,
find those papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you need to make an appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Denver office in Longmont accepts
walk-ins.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Grand Junction, you need to make an
appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Springs, you need to make an
appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The phone number is on the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could have had that for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I failed you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to do a little bit of
this on your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So call and make an appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's way easier to call and make an
appointment in Springs than it is to sit
[SPEAKER_04]: there and wait for like three hours in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You waited all day in Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made my appointment for Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed up about 15 minutes early because
I thought it would take much longer to get
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to judge I-25.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could take you an hour or an hour and a
half to get from here to there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got there about 15 minutes early and
the lady was like, Hey, the guy that was
[SPEAKER_04]: scheduled before you didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took her, I don't know,
maybe an hour to do the entire process.
[SPEAKER_04]: She fingerprinted me, interviewed me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're waiting all day in
Denver is because that's how long it
[SPEAKER_03]: takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of other people just
showed up every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just relax when they're fingerprinting
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got warrants or something,
if you're wanted in the state of Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're in the MED office getting your
shit done, they run your ID and if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted, they come and fucking arrest you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really can't emphasize like read the
questions and if the answer's yes to the
[SPEAKER_03]: first four or you've got like active
warrants out now, don't apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't apply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will come and arrest you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're getting fingerprinted and they
run your shit and you're wanted by the
[SPEAKER_04]: FBI, there's a sign on the door that says
unmarked or plain clothes security officer
[SPEAKER_04]: on premises at all times.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will come and arrest you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent three and a half hours trying to
find the dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I found both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're not playing around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the questions, answer them honestly
for the second secondary questions like
[SPEAKER_03]: child support and student loans.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got any of those, you know,
any of those questions apply to you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to need to contact that
institution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had to contact everybody I've got
student loans with and get a paper that
[SPEAKER_03]: says my student loans are in good
standing, which means if you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: ducking that shit for a decade,
you need to stand up, take the punch,
[SPEAKER_03]: set up a payment plan, start making
payments.
[SPEAKER_03]: You only need to make one payment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with child support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your child support is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was cool because mine's legit,
but if your child support is fucked up,
[SPEAKER_04]: they will make you get a paper from your
caseworker that says that you're paying
[SPEAKER_04]: and that you're doing what you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had felonies 17 years ago or over
the deadline and you're good to go,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need paperwork from the court that
adjudicated your felony in the original
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to fucking contact the court that
tried and sends to you and get the
[SPEAKER_03]: paperwork from them that says you
completed successfully and on what date
[SPEAKER_03]: you completed for every fucking felony.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can be a real pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got, I mean, I've talked to people
in Denver while I was waiting that had to
[SPEAKER_03]: go to like seven different courthouses to
pick up stuff that they got between 20 or
[SPEAKER_03]: like 18 and 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they've been perfect for a
decade, but they had still had to spend
[SPEAKER_03]: four days driving between courthouses,
getting paperwork so that they could then
[SPEAKER_03]: apply to work in the legal marijuana
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like have your shit together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some, for some of you, that's going to
be a lot of paperwork gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have it together,
the lady at the MED office or the man,
[SPEAKER_04]: the person that helped me was a lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always think it's a lady,
but the person that helps you at the MED
[SPEAKER_04]: office, they will give you a list of
everything that you need after you fail
[SPEAKER_04]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first step of the process when
you get there and it's your turn is they
[SPEAKER_03]: go through your shit piece by piece and
make sure you have everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got done, it was very clearly
like you have everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your first try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: High five.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was well prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew plenty of people that have badges.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, neither of us had an issue,
but we've all talked to countless people
[SPEAKER_03]: that have no idea what this process looks
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: They even moved to Colorado, moved across
the country unprepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so knowing this and doing it right is
sort of essential folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got 44 felonies, you're probably
not going to get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been thinking about him this whole
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our buddy, 44.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's ever known why we call him 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the only hint we're going to
give you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you show up, okay, the next step is
show up and complete the damn interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an MED interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter what you wear or
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comb your hair if you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got dreadlocks, flatten them down
because they're going to make you take off
[SPEAKER_04]: your hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to make you take your hat
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to wear the picture
they take around your neck for the next
[SPEAKER_03]: two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, I'm 6'5".
[SPEAKER_04]: And that picture place, they have like a
little, like a swatch on the floor or on
[SPEAKER_04]: the wall of material where you're supposed
to stand in front of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit's like 5'10", like where most
people are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to do a squat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to smile as I'm doing
squats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squat, but not real far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you show up for the place,
when you show up for the interview,
[SPEAKER_04]: bring the completed application,
have that shit filled out before you get
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring your ID, bring your court papers and
disclosure forms if you've got any of
[SPEAKER_04]: those to bring with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring proof of residency if you don't
have, if you're new to Colorado and your
[SPEAKER_04]: ID, if you do have an out of state ID,
that's what the fuck I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your ID is from out of state,
bring proof of residency that you do live
[SPEAKER_04]: in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring a phone bill, bring a fucking cable
bill, bring the light bill, bring whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: you got that shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This goes back to column.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll tell you exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the time to bring up,
my ID says I'm from Texas or Tennessee or
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever the fuck, like bring it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll tell you exactly what you need
supporting paperwork wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got felonies, they'll tell you
what to, what to ask the courts for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with your child support stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They told me exactly what the letter had
to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all on the application when you look
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're happy to answer these
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not take cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring a money order or bring a check.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to get your key badge,
and this is where we'll talk about this
[SPEAKER_04]: part, if you're going to get your key
badge, it's going to cost you $300.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want your support badge,
it is $150.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, look to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that wrong, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I just looked at the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the prices were right, but I think
Denver takes cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like 85%.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I said that to somebody else
that was helping me with this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, they will not accept cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the website says bring check or money
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm pretty sure they quit accepting
cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would surprise me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that only one office did,
and I could have sworn it was Denver,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I might have taken a check.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked at a place that had a lot of cash
flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we had a lot of cash in the end of
the register at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked at several places and just
imagine how many applications they handle
[SPEAKER_04]: a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: $150 a badge, minimum time, 16,000
employees divided by 365 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the math.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't want that much money in a
box in the office anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like over a fucking couple of days,
that box is going to be full of cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand they probably,
they just be prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys take a check or take a money
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stop it somewhere that sells a money
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking Walmart sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have money orders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most Walgreens will sell you a
money order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several 7-elevens will do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to the post office,
get yourself a money order, go to the MED
[SPEAKER_04]: place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's talk about the difference
between a key badge and a support badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: There always has to be a support badge on
premises.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can be in my grow without a support
badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: There either has to be a red badge,
which is the owner badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to own the place to get that one
or a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have a key badge,
if there's not a key badge on premises,
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody else can be in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the support badges can be in the
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I find it advantageous to go ahead and
get that key badge because then you're
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of more qualified to do more shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've already got more ability to take on
more responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made sure to get the key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And did it help you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like getting your key badge
helped you advance in your position at the
[SPEAKER_04]: spot?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those rules are more heavily
enforced on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe I'm just, no, I've got to be the,
I'm the only support badge several nights
[SPEAKER_03]: a week at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be why, or my only key badge,
that might be why I got promoted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my promotions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes you more promotable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a support badge, you can be like a bud
tender.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be a joint roller.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, in the gardens, you can- Support
badge is the starter badge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you've only got 150 to spend on a
badge, and you know, you're going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: trimmer for the first year or a bud
tender, you can go ahead and get the
[SPEAKER_03]: support.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, we're not saying don't,
but the key badge definitely gives you
[SPEAKER_03]: more opportunities in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're one of those people that's
moving to Colorado with a degree in
[SPEAKER_03]: biochemistry, like you might want to go
ahead and get the support badge or the key
[SPEAKER_03]: badge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm mixing those two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to figure you confused me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key badge is the more important one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking for the distinguishing it
says something about on the application.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to have keys and be in
charge of employees and have access to
[SPEAKER_04]: limited access areas, you should go ahead
and get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I recommend, of course, get the key
badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have the money for it,
get yourself a support badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're an ambitious person and you feel
like you want to move up, if you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to manage that bitch, get the key,
go ahead and get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to work with the grow team,
if you're real enthusiastic and you can
[SPEAKER_04]: show that you can do it, get yourself a
key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to see you move up in the
industry super quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew I wasn't going to be on the bottom
rung for long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I fully got that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: On purpose, like I know a lot of other
people that did that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a couple of people who got the
support and have been kind of passed over
[SPEAKER_03]: several times because they can't meet some
of those requirements that you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: have the key for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to have a key badge on premises at all
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to be pretty much in the same room
with the support badges and even leave
[SPEAKER_04]: them in another room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to be like the cultivation
manager, get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be a trim team leader,
get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe even if you want to be lead
budtender, you might need a key badge
[SPEAKER_04]: because you'll be carrying product back to
the storage room, which requires a key
[SPEAKER_04]: badge to get into, or at least it should.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get your badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decide which badge you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next step here, you guys, once you've
got your badge, wait for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking smile for your picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look good in the picture, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to look like a dumbass and
then hang that picture around your neck
[SPEAKER_03]: for the next two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wear that bright green Colorado medical
marijuana enforcement division lanyard
[SPEAKER_04]: with a cheesy ass picture on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so funny walking into places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still have your original lanyard?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the original green one, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to be OG, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you've got that picture with your
cheesy ass grin on it and you got a badge,
[SPEAKER_04]: the next step is to get a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get the badge now, you can apply
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think about what you're good at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you good at budtending?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you good at trimming?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, we keep saying budtending and
trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ways into this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to be a master grower,
most places have a master grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to start trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to show them that you
know about plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day the master grower is going to go,
fuck, I need help transplanting plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to go, I'm good at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's going to go, well, come show me
what you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can follow directions and do it
the way that he wants it done and also
[SPEAKER_04]: contribute skill, knowledge, and care to
the job, you may end up being assistant
[SPEAKER_04]: grower one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may let you come help me pull leaves in
the garden one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll work your way up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day when I'm or not, not me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say about the master
grower at whatever facility you work at
[SPEAKER_04]: one day when he's sick or whatever,
he's got the shits and can't come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you get to water the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get to learn how to become a
master grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to work your way up one way
or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff and I were both bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you start.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people start off as trimmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you start.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be almost anything in the
marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We literally need every profession.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have played bud tender, manager,
hire and fireer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did the hiring and firing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still doing the growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do some transportation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do all of the... You've helped with
design at different points.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've designed a couple of facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've designed rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk to people every day that aren't
prepared for that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, well, I've been in marketing
for like 10 years and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you ready to trim some weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you could learn everything in
this room and what their different
[SPEAKER_03]: applications are?
[SPEAKER_03]: For different patients and sell it
accurately and well-informed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you pull that off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you can't do that or be cool
with trimming a shill of weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to have a really hard time
looking for dispensary that's actively
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for a marketing dude who's never
worked in legal weed before and doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily know the community,
the culture, the product, the clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot you need to know and you
learn that when you start as a bud tender
[SPEAKER_03]: or a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole etiquette.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole world to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: A buddy of mine started as a trimmer and
like six weeks later he was running a trim
[SPEAKER_03]: crew for like seven different dispensaries
and they just cycled between them as they
[SPEAKER_03]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Linus.
[SPEAKER_03]: He struggled for a while finding a
dispensary that would even take him on as
[SPEAKER_03]: a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he finally found one, he made sure to
put it in his all and now he's running a
[SPEAKER_03]: big ass crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what he's doing on Facebook and he's
killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: His crew is killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're killing it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We moved up quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be motivated if you want to come here and
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: This industry is growing so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're growing so rapidly and there are so
many people coming from around the world
[SPEAKER_04]: to be in this industry that there are 50
people trying to take your job in this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green and Healthy Wellness is a small shop
with a small location.
[SPEAKER_04]: We aren't very well known yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of new.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a large following.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what I'm trying to say with
a whole bunch of words.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a huge following,
but we get probably five to 10
[SPEAKER_04]: applications every single day of people
that want to be growers, trimmers,
[SPEAKER_04]: bud tenders, whatever they can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I will clean the toilets as
long as you give me a job in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of people coming in that are
doing it right, that are ready to work,
[SPEAKER_03]: that know the industry and know how to
sell their place in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it comes down to knowing how to
pitch your previous work experience
[SPEAKER_03]: because I saw this old weed from my living
room for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like shit on a resume.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did an episode before that covered
some of the resumes you got in the grow
[SPEAKER_03]: and how ridiculous some of them could get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put together a real resume.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know what that is,
Google it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be prepared because there's a lot of
people gunning for the jobs that are
[SPEAKER_03]: available even with this how fast we're
expanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to stand out at all,
you got to do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some of the problems that
come with getting a job working in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one most obvious problem to me
is banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you worked at a dispensary or as a
grower, and I can't speak for every shop
[SPEAKER_04]: or every grow, and this is something that
I probably shouldn't say too much about,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is the damn truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: When payday comes, you get an envelope
stuffed with cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is done in cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a pay stub and taxes are taken
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else is the same, but instead
of a check at the bottom or better yet,
[SPEAKER_03]: a voided check that tells you about the
direct deposit you just got, you get a
[SPEAKER_03]: check stub folded up with a bunch of 20s
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awkward as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to carry all these damn 20s in
your backpack or somehow to the car and
[SPEAKER_04]: then home.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just payroll.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: State taxes, federal taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Electric bills, rent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get home, you got to figure out a
way to convert all that cash into some way
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay your rent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the obvious problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, employees can usually get bank
accounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's smaller banks, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the businesses that really can't get
accounts, but you've still got to transfer
[SPEAKER_03]: cash to bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: That cash came from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it stinks like weed,
which can trigger your account to get
[SPEAKER_03]: closed if your weed stank too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your money stinks too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a mutual friend whose account was
just closed because their cash deposit
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled way too much like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a second safe, y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one of the problems, we've talked
about this a little bit on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another problem that can happen if you
work in the cannabis industry is you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get pulled over and you're going
to smell like a pound of fucking weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: the cops are going to harass you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a badge, a lot of times they
expect you to be a model citizen because
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got the badge and you know the
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be a little more careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back to putting your best foot
forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stink like weed with your badge on
because as soon as they see that fucker or
[SPEAKER_03]: even the green lanyard that goes with it,
they're automatically going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking, is this person high right now
behind the wheel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a DUI at rest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, renting is hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a house is hard when your place of
employment is green and healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a stigma involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: That a lot of people don't realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a friend leaving the industry
right now and they were talking to me just
[SPEAKER_03]: this afternoon that they're applying for
jobs that aren't in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's real hesitant because he hasn't
faced the company, the drug tests in a
[SPEAKER_03]: decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a bud tender and a cannabis consumer
and passionate about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: really enjoys that aspect of his life.
[SPEAKER_03]: At minimum, he's going to have to give it
up until he can pee clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't necessarily expecting to leave
the industry this abruptly so he's not
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: At best, his ass is going to be out of
work for a while while he looks for either
[SPEAKER_03]: jobs that don't test or whatnot,
but he's extra hesitant because as soon as
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like, well, what did you just stop
doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, well, I've worked in the legal
marijuana industry for three years and now
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be judgmental for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they don't typically drug test or
there's a lot of companies, I worked for a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of them back in the day that just
threatened to drug test and the only drug
[SPEAKER_03]: test they do is whether or not you show up
to get your cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't actually afford to pay the 75
bucks or whatever to test you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even those companies are more apt to test
somebody who's coming out of the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: weed industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just got that stigma attached to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Renting, banking, renting cars,
getting loans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to get to that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Renting a car is kind of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was turned down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bought a new car.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, shout out to my new car,
but also shout out to Mario Orcholetta for
[SPEAKER_04]: the sweet hookup on the new car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out for not having to fix your old
car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did that also and I got two cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a winter car and a summer car now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting stacks of envelopes in
the mail from credit companies that
[SPEAKER_04]: declined my credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at why, it says insufficient
employment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make a shit ton of money, not to brag
about my money, but I make plenty of
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking money for the car that I bought.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just didn't like it that I worked at
a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would call me while I was waiting in
the Ford dealership to buy my car.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would call and they'd be like,
hey, we've just got one question about
[SPEAKER_04]: your employment.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this G-A-H-W you work at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I just write down G-A-H-W,
turn to avoid questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, it stands for green and
healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh, are you a weed grower?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, well, yeah, bitch,
why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, we can't give you credit today and
they just hang up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all companies, but it's several.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the companies that don't
apply to this, but there's a stigma that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to take on and you kind of
have to be ready to bear that cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not just out in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plenty of you got family that's like,
oh, fucking cousin Ricky working at the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed store.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should mention all the drug testing
talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dispensary won't drug test you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, but don't show up high
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many fucking rules to come
toasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can't tell you're high, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can tell you're high, you're in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be that high, asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get us all in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: The obvious problems with working in the
industry are banking, credit, getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: car, getting a loan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of shit is hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friend Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked her for guidance on this because
she is a manager to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said the first thing she spattered off
with the passion was fucking sexism in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: She called it a boys club and said that
this is ran by guys and she's a woman and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard to be taken fucking seriously by
all the men in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies, when you come to Colorado,
your chances of getting a job are nearly
[SPEAKER_04]: tripled of what a guy with the same
qualifications are going to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The chances of that same dude are going to
have of getting employment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds rude to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care what you'd look like if
you're a trimmer for the most part,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you're a bud tender, automatically
hot females go to the top of the stack and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of true in any industry,
but it's really true in the marijuana
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super true in the cannabis industry,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get hired first.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, everybody's going to
look at your titties all fucking day long
[SPEAKER_04]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are used to growing weed in our
basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're used to being a bunch of bros.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a boys club.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should know this by now, but the grow
environment, the weed business
[SPEAKER_04]: environment, sometimes people forget and
it gets a little bit sexist a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules that apply to every other
industry, we're under so many weed
[SPEAKER_03]: specific rules that in a lot of ways,
the ball gets dropped with some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slap us, remind us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be like, boys, there are women in the
room, behave your fucking selves.
[SPEAKER_04]: A guy like myself will check myself after
one or two of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe me, I don't say some shit when
Damsel's around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out, Damsel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned to respect the ladies a
little bit better because I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: reminded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the ladies that have taught
us that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some sexism in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be prepared for that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another huge problem, you cannot consume
on site.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to consume cannabis while
you're working at a medical marijuana or
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational marijuana grow facility,
processing facility, anything like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you cannot do it anywhere near the
building.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care where you go, what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cameras cannot see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: People that are leaving the dispensary
should not see you consuming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Consume your medicine somewhere far away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes for customers too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're shopping in the league weed
industry, don't try to fucking roll a
[SPEAKER_03]: joint in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, something that I would mention is a
pain in the ass in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may think I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are going to be like,
wah, but there is so much tedious
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation and so much pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went way overboard with the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch people every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grind up scraps of marijuana like
stems, like shit that you wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: consider feeling bad about if you threw
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to grind it with coffee and
shredded paper to make it
[SPEAKER_03]: indistinguishable and unusable.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you translate that to a major grow,
the amount of just how you throw out the
[SPEAKER_03]: trash becomes a majorly complicated
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run a big grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are harvesting 85 lights worth of
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make trash lasagna, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do, I will start a trash can where
the trimmers are and I'll put,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll harvest a plant and I will put that
pot of dirt in the bottom of the can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's a little bit of dirt in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then as we trim, the leaves and a little
bit of sticks will go in and then I'll go
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest another plant or maybe we've got
old pots stacked up and I'll pour some of
[SPEAKER_04]: that dirt in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes dirt, leaves, dirt, leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll sweep up the floor and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the sweepings in there, but you got to
mix up that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed shouldn't be recognizable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it has to go into a locked trash can,
which is also behind a gate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have had our fucking trash broken
into, torn out of the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tear the bags open and they destroy
all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to go fucking sweep it up and put
the trash back in the goddamn trash can in
[SPEAKER_04]: the morning when I get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regulations are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's got to be weighed a million
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are checks on things also.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit stressful on all the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the pressure is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have to happen at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have to be done quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't wait for some shit in a big
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on camera from 9,000 different
angles, so don't ever think you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to get away with anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being on camera on every square inch takes
some adjusting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch it all day at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: People forget they're on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pointed out to customers, we're on
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see and hear everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to get us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop fucking asking how to take weed to
Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't answer you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop asking how many pieces of edibles you
should eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking one in way two hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch, I told you twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets stressful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the rules always fucking change.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get emails once a week with new rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a special company that makes law
books on their third marijuana book now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to buy the original book and then
the two addendum books.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's most of what I've got that's
stressful.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that Mike can testify to,
because he's a bud tinder mostly,
[SPEAKER_04]: now the consumer is so educated that they
expect a bud and foe educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think they know what the fuck they're
talking about that they expect a bud
tinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear the phrase sad of a lot,
and I hear indigo even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good and a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm blessed to be in the medical
side of things now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of that too, but honestly,
I see a more touristy side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, they just haven't had the
culture and the community out loud and
[SPEAKER_03]: proud like we have here in Colorado,
down in Texas and in Arkansas for as long.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really tell who's been in the
community actively and who hasn't,
[SPEAKER_03]: who's been a marijuana consumer in the
total shadows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of their friends don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely wouldn't talk about it in
public or on the news or on the radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never heard anyone say sativa
before or indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just never happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've only ever read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thinking about that boggles my mind a
little bit, so I try to pity them a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I hear it for the 14th time on a
Saturday, it makes me want to fucking cock
[SPEAKER_03]: punch somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the same thing in the wine world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It exists in other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think they know a lot and they act
smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's naughty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the dispensary where the budtender
knows fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes you feel stupid and doesn't
realize that I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it when they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a shop the other day in Denver
and I heard wrong information.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a strain labeled wrong and I
listened to the budtender go on for four
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes about how it was in indica when
it's a really popular sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just sitting there shaking my head as
the customer gobbles it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, dude, look at the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell that's a sativa from over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the buds are growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid professional weed smokers.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, thanks for coming to the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, that's all we've got for how to
get your badge here in the state of
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how to get your badge and some of
the things that come along with that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular key to awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out once again to that one mountain
girl and also a huge shout out to Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both were huge contributors to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also shout out to the CDE, the Colorado
Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_04]: Environment website for all the
information they gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody who wished me a happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was on Facebook, if it was on
Instagram, if it was on Twitter,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it was here face to face, if it was
through text message.
[SPEAKER_04]: However it was, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole week has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still raging.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been several days since my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually the fourth now and my
birthday was on the first and I have
[SPEAKER_04]: finally eaten all of the food and snacks
that I was given on my birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I however have not consumed all of the
Chipotle gift cards that I was given.
Dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody gave me a Chipotle gift card so I
got that on deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that'll be my after work treat
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went to check my phone to see if
Chipotle was still possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of late for Chipotle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big thanks to everybody that hooked me
up for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you fed me, if you took me out,
if you dad me out, if you gave me some
[SPEAKER_04]: solventless hash that I pressed into one
giant fucking dad, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you dad me out with Spherex,
big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also big shout out to my friends at the
Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dropped into the Canna Canyon yesterday
and hung out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in there dad me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in there was happy to see me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're ever in Colorado Springs and you
need a place to stop and kill a few
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes, you want to smoke down,
I always recommend the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Colorado Boulevard, Colorado
Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you Google the Canna Canyon in Colorado
Springs, you will get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell Camille that Rasta Jeff sent you that
you listen to the Grow from the Heart
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: She will treat you like royalty.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think I've got for you this
week, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have more episodes planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do an episode with a bunch of
lovely ladies and we'll talk about women
[SPEAKER_04]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it'll be in the future anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to talk too much about
what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My little notebook is over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, I want to thank you for hanging out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to leave the little guy at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you didn't miss him too much while
you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let you get back to him real
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was about that time, but it's
good to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard an episode a little while back,
someone mentioned missing me on the shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm trying to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life got crazy, but this is still
important to me and I want to be here as
[SPEAKER_03]: often as I can, but that's not as often as
I would like right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for my absence and I hope you
like me on the show lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our buddy Mike O was his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was Mike O.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent a couple of emails, which I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like repeated updates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he was a little pissed off that you
hadn't been here for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was kind of upset with the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life exploded and the show had to take a
back burner for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a minute there, it was a big part of
my extracurricular activities and that
[SPEAKER_03]: time got filled big time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't blame you at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kid is the most important thing in
your world as it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but yeah, the show is still a
priority, so we're recording real late at
[SPEAKER_03]: night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we said, Chipotle, be fucking close.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're scratching it out,
but I wanted to be part of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting a badge is like, I've seen so many
people fucked because they didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: this information before they made a big
leap and I really wanted to be a part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, sorry for the ramblings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you got the information you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because knowing is half the battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing is fucking half the battle,
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I want to thank everybody for
listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again to Mike for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be back in seven days with another
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what I'm going to put out for
you in seven days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a lot of stuff written down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you tune in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you check out the show on
iTunes, Stitcher or iRegion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have any sponsors on this
episode.

you've got a product you'd like me to
[SPEAKER_04]: review, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big shout out to a

Sphere-X last night at the Cannon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only took one dab of it so far.

[SPEAKER_04]: So check that product out if you're in
Colorado.

[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to everybody out there in the
cannabis community who's doing their
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, who's making this shit happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big shout out to my ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you're awesome, even though you
never needed to, you feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to never hurt no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to kill off the one you've
manned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to never hurt no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to kill off the one you've
manned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see now, girls and guns, guns and
girls, come together like the diamond and
[SPEAKER_01]: pearl.
[SPEAKER_01]: One and the one rule the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: One and the one rule the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you're awesome, even though you
never needed to, you feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you're awesome, even though you
never needed to, you feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you're awesome, even though you
never needed to, you feel it.
I said you're awesome, even though you
never needed to, you feel it.
