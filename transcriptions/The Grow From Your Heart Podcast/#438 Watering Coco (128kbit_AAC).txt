[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 438 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past couple of days, I have been
taking dabs of Tropicana lychee fambrosia
[SPEAKER_00]: from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label on this product says it
contains 71% THC and 82.9% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 4-gram jar smells ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like rotten mangoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like raspberry syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells deliciously disgusting and
overwhelming all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a dab, the raspberry flavor
just coats your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a sweet, sugary aftertaste
that sticks around for quite a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the buzz goes straight to your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you a little bit silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you kind of forget where you put
your car keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you lose your phone while
you're scrolling on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I want to give a huge shout
out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for
[SPEAKER_00]: the delicious Tropicana lychee fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to read an
email about overwatering and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do that, let's give a few shout
outs to my friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to my friend,
Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant grow from your heart
podcast shout out to Tyler R.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant shout out to John
Milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a giant grow from your
heart podcast shout out to my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big giant thanks to all of my
friends who support the podcast on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to support the show,
you can do so by going to www
[SPEAKER_00]: .apothecaryfarms.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information that you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, listeners, I said I was going
to read an email about watering our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right down to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rasta Jeff, go ahead and use my name
on your podcast because cannabis is so
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking legal here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend,
Brett, up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on, it says, aside from
dabbing a little as a teen, I am new to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use just prior to full Canadian
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following a brain injury with a host of
side effects I will not get into,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started using cannabis medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I used cannabis long before I had a
traumatic brain injury, then I had a life
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting traumatic brain injury and I
have continued to use cannabis and I see
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects from when I am able to
medicate properly, from when I am not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to medicate properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell that cannabis does help with
the effects and or side effects of my
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury and the recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do understand that it works for you
and I am a believer and I hope things are
[SPEAKER_00]: going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with this message because
it's not about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, without question, cannabis has
been the single best medicine I have used
[SPEAKER_00]: for my issues with no side effects from
its use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have become a firm believer and advocate
of this plant and its value as medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a recreational herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest, when you don't feel good
most of the time, it feels amazing to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some relief even if for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely understand and agree with
everything that you just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't feel good, it's hard to
enjoy life, it's hard to be around people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to do the things that you would
normally enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes normal life a struggle,
just not feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding relief through cannabis can put
you back into your normal daily routine,
[SPEAKER_00]: put you back on a rhythm and put you back
in the position to enjoy your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something I really like that our new
friend Brett said is that he believes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicinal and recreational powers of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that almost all cannabis in a way
can be labeled as some sort of medical or
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak for everybody, but in most
cases, cannabis makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a point that if you consume
too much cannabis, it will make you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: worse or like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works as any other medicine would.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that any use of cannabis can
be considered recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're just sitting here at the table
and I decide, hey, you want to smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint with me and we smoke a joint,
we feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might've felt just fine before we
smoked, but we feel even better after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you not want to do something
that makes you feel better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you felt just fine before,
you improved upon feeling just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you feel fucking excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about if you start in pain,
you normally start at zero, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling just fine is a zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling pretty cool is a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling great is like a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling fucking stoned as shit is like a
ten, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got the other way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when you wake up, your back hurts,
your neck hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got some sort of debilitating
condition where everything hurts and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're already starting off at negative
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got a happiness and a
comfort and a level of enjoyment deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only enjoy life so much if you
already started off at negative seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to consume something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe rub some cream on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take some tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you get your CBD and or THC into
your body, when you do that, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_00]: take that negative seven to a negative
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get that down to a negative
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can dial in your treatment
along with your diet and your medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a few other things to hone in your
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we can get you to a zero and
then eventually start turning you the
[SPEAKER_00]: other way and get you on the positive side
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any way that cannabis is improving the
quality of your life or allowing you to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy life a little more, I find that to
be medicinal or therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see physical pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a lot of diseases and ailments,
but mental health, you can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in pain all day, not being able to
live your normal life because you were
[SPEAKER_00]: slowed down by pain or a condition will
wear on you mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will wear you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to smoke down and first of all,
relieve that physical pain will allow your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain to enjoy life.
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to think about how bad it
hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to think about protecting
that sore spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of chill out and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, the pain will melt away a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, you'll forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, you'll be able to just relax and
enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've now escaped that trap that was pain
or that ailment that was bothering you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit freeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part a lot of people may
overlook or may not see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see when someone's walking funny or
grabbing their hip or making a funny face
[SPEAKER_00]: because their back hurts, but we can't see
what you're going through from being in
[SPEAKER_00]: pain all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a little smoke, a little relief
goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can call all of that consumption
medical or therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame it on those dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have decided to grow my own after
spending more than I can afford from
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now working on my second grow after
harvesting a decent yield and quality
[SPEAKER_00]: legal product and making my own oil
infusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using autoflowers and I admit this
knowing how you feel about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I have talked trash about
autoflowers, but I have found that they
[SPEAKER_00]: work for people and if they have their
application, use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use them to the best of your advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is what you want to do,
I am going to be more diplomatic toward my
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflower growing friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to buy autoflower seeds,
big shout out to my friend at Mephisto
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I thought this was a good idea at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I've got brain damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, but after
listening to your podcast, I am very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in running regular photo period
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I would like to run your
genetics for this, I'm afraid ordering
[SPEAKER_00]: from the USA may cause more grief than I'd
like in the long run, potentially getting
[SPEAKER_00]: me banned from your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a chance that your genetics will
make it to a distributor in Canada that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could then order?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do not have any plans for a
Canadian distributor anytime in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future, but I can suggest you check with
seeds here now dot com and see if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to help you out in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the part of the email where
we get to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, also, I am growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listened and understand your level of
watering, but what I can't find
[SPEAKER_00]: information on is when to begin watering
to run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get concerned about nutrient buildup in
the cocoa, but I also don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: overwater a plant without a root mass that
can handle that much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the most out of my plant
genetics, but I feel that I'm holding them
[SPEAKER_00]: back by waiting too long to be sure they
can handle a runoff watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any tips would be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I do have some great tips for you
before we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the comment where you
said you have listened and understand my
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what this person is referring to
is episode three thirty seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is titled one through five watering
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys like to catch up with that,
I highly suggest you listen to episode
[SPEAKER_00]: three thirty seven and understand one
through five watering tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's get into the suggestion
portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am watering plants in cocoa,
I like to achieve about 10 to 20 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff with each watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is I need to water that
plant until that cocoa is saturated and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to water until I get 20 percent
excess water coming out of the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: my container.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons to water
your cocoa this way, but the main reason
[SPEAKER_00]: is to make sure that you don't have any
salts or nutrients from previous waterings
[SPEAKER_00]: built up in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, we are feeding the plants
more salts than they can take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a buildup in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just keep adding more salts in and
nothing runs off out the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will get a heavy saturation of salt
based minerals in our medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That heavy saturation of salt based
minerals will disrupt the pH of our root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will disrupt the uptake of our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see nutrient problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see plants that start changing
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see plants that start slowing
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not reach our harvest goals and we
will not reach our potency expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the main reasons why we
like to water our plants to runoff when
[SPEAKER_00]: using cocoa as a medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something I should touch on before we
go too far is if you are going to saturate
[SPEAKER_00]: your cocoa that heavily, it is a good idea
to amend it with some sort of aeration
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put perlite and persilite both
in my cocoa mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most commercial environments,
I prefer to run a three gallon fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill those fabric pots with a perlite,
persilite, and cocoa coir mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most situations, I use 20% perlite,
20% persilite, and 60% cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some situations, I will adjust that mix
depending on the environment, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers in that facility, depending on
the genetics in that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some situations, I will do 15%
persilite, 15% perlite, and 70% cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those decisions are based on
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some of those are based on the
facility, and some are based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and also those are based on
schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use a little bit less perlite and
persilite, I do get a little longer wet
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry time so the plants don't need to
be watered as frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are using cocoa and you're
going to water to full saturation to get
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff, I do recommend some sort of
aeration product in there, perlite and
[SPEAKER_00]: persilite are always my go-tos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way they fluff up that cocoa
and they don't add anything to my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to talk about cocoa,
one more thing I should mention,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what brand of cocoa you're
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what it is, I do recommend
giving it a rinse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy bags of cocoa, it can be very
salty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen people use bagged cocoa
straight out of the bag, into the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: put a plant in it, feed it, throw it in
the grow room, and watch that plant turn
[SPEAKER_00]: to shit because they did not rinse the
excess salt out of that bagged cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your cocoa is coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it was shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it was stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that a lot of times there is
a large buildup of salt in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: store-bought cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rinse that out if you've got the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an EC meter, fill up a large
container with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test the EC of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test the pH of that water if you have the
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark those two things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill a small container with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then water that container until you get
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather some of that runoff water in a
clean container and test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the TDS?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the EC of that runoff water?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is really high, you need to clean
that cocoa before you put your plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it will fry your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it doesn't sound like our friend Brett
is having a salt issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure to mention
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have faith in Brett that he rinsed
out his medium so we know he's got some
[SPEAKER_00]: nice clean cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also trust that he put plenty of
perlite or persolite in there so we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that he has got plenty of aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that he listened to episode
337 so he understands 1 through 5 water
[SPEAKER_00]: tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems to understand that he wants a
little bit of runoff, but he is afraid to
[SPEAKER_00]: water his small plants because he is not
sure that their small root system is ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle such a massive watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good concern because
watering cocoa can be confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be deceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first few times cocoa does hold a lot
of water and the wet and dry time is
[SPEAKER_00]: vastly different than that of working with
a soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over watering your plants and cocoa will
slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also under watering them will allow them
to get too dry which prevents them from
[SPEAKER_00]: eating which will give us nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do need to dial in our wet and dry
cycles and our watering times and also
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in our amount of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about watering our small
plants to runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part that really gets my
attention is if you are too concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about giving that plant that much water in
that container, that maybe you have
[SPEAKER_00]: probably possibly up potted too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may have a small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put that clone into a small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go something in like a 4x4 cube,
maybe a 6 inch net pot, something really
[SPEAKER_00]: small where we can contain all of that
medium where we don't have to water a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you are not wasting a lot of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not wasting a lot of nutrients
just watering medium that doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: roots in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off with a smaller pot then
gradually increase pot size until you
[SPEAKER_00]: reach your 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clones generally go into a 4 inch
square pot or a 6 inch round net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I let them grow until that pot is
filled with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get it almost root bound in that
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will transplant it into a 3 gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go from that 4 inch square pot or
that round 6 inch net pot, I usually have
[SPEAKER_00]: to use my fingers to break up some of
those roots to encourage them to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outward because I leave it in that first
pot until it gets fairly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first container is only temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have it in there to get it
developed, just to get it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to water a whole bunch of
medium in a whole bunch of space with no
[SPEAKER_00]: roots so that smaller container is
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I can fit more of them in my space so
I can pack way more small veg plants under
[SPEAKER_00]: some T5s or Veglites in a small pot than I
could if I had them already in their 3
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots and they are only 6 inches
tall and have a few nodes and they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: branched out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need to give them that much
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep them in the small pot and I let
them grow until they are almost root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really need to be transplanted by the
time I pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I almost have to cut the pot off
because the roots have grown so massively
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first thought is that you may be
transplanting too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go from that clone to a small
container, let it grow until it's busting
[SPEAKER_00]: out, then go to a big container and then
if you want to up pot one more time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait once again until it is
busting out until that first container is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost full of roots where when you take
the container off you can see those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: just spiraling around the outside of the
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until then to transplant and that
will absolutely reduce the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: drowning your plant when you do water to
full saturation to achieve a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first concern is you may be
transplanting too soon and if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting too soon, maybe you are
transplanting into too large of a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to make more gradual of a
pot size increase and that may reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of creating a giant pool for that
small plant to drown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe wait a little bit longer and
possibly reduce the transplant pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say Brett has done everything
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has got his small container plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is busting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are starting to hang out of the
bottom of the pot a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it creeping out through the
drainage holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some roots coming out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like nice spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant is in a four inch square pot
or perhaps a six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's up pot that plant into a three
gallon pot of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we just gently remove that
six inch net pot right off the root ball
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not super wet, if it's not super
dry, it should just slide off nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the medium should stay in one nice
clump there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see roots wrapped around the bottom
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point I would hold the plant in my
palms to where the plant is facing
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up just like it naturally should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of cradling the plant in my
palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stick my fingers in the middle of
the bottom of that root ball and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: just separate it and break it up a little
bit with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're pulling someone's
dreadlocks apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were encouraging proper root growth at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant is tied up in that
container, you want to break those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: up so that it will spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots are now used to growing in a
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to tell them, hey, you're free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go fill this new container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would set that in the new container
that is probably about halfway,
[SPEAKER_00]: three quarters of the way filled with
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set that new plant right inside that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that container up with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack it semi tight in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it super loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the water falling right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it so tight that the roots
can't dig through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pack it semi tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're filling containers,
I always suggest leaving an inch or two so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can water the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget you need room for water in
that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got it filled up appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've now got your plant essentially
successfully transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, I would saturate that cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water until runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that first transplant time,
I really love to soak the shit out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go more than 20% runoff at this time
because I want to ensure that I saturate
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that medium with water,
with nutrients, and I want to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: settle everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want there to be any dry spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a dry spot in the middle,
that will slow down plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to saturate my new medium,
and that'll really help the cocoa settle
[SPEAKER_00]: into the container and let me know if I
need to add more onto the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're probably thinking,
holy shit, Ross and Jeff, we just drowned
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much water in this container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got an aeration product in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 20% perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 20% persilite or a similar mix
in our container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to worry about drowning
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got a healthy plant with an
established root zone that can take this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of a watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shouldn't have to worry about
drowning that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next step is to watch this plant
as the medium dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to want to stick
a moisture content meter inside that cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can pay attention to that
digitally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can look at it on their phone and
they can see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best way to do it is to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick your finger in the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pick up the pot, does it feel
nearly as heavy as it did when you first
[SPEAKER_00]: watered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel half as heavy as it did when
you first watered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it feel super light like you might
throw it across the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from one through five water
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know if it needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put your finger in there,
does it feel wet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel dusty?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the plant need water?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing to pay attention
to is the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it telling you that it needs a drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: When cannabis plants get thirsty,
the leaves start to droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get really thirsty, the top of
the plant starts to tip over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you see those leaves start to
droop, it needed water just a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down how long ago it was or remember
what that medium feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your finger in there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick it up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time, water it 15 minutes before it
gets to that point and you have found the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal watering cycle for a plant in a
cocoa container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your wet and dry times are going to vary
depending on plant size, container size,
[SPEAKER_00]: light size, and VPD of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as your plant is large enough
and established enough to be in the size
[SPEAKER_00]: pot in which you have put it, you should
not over water your plant if you give it
[SPEAKER_00]: enough time to dry between waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main suggestions would be to make
sure that your plant has a well
[SPEAKER_00]: established root zone before you try to up
pot it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next suggestion is make sure you're not
going into too large of a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you do water, get that
saturation, get that runoff, then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: step is patience and learning the plant to
see when it wants water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part is going to be room,
environment, plant and strain and also
[SPEAKER_00]: watering type dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of the relationship that you
will have to build with each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes you're going to be worried
because the bottom part of your container
[SPEAKER_00]: will have more moisture than the top part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your roots have grown down to
that bottom part and they are drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: from that bottom part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That slight dryness will encourage the
roots to go seeking moisture and finding
[SPEAKER_00]: water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a fine line between
encouraging growth and completely starving
[SPEAKER_00]: and dehydrating a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn when they start showing you that
they're a little bit thirsty and then
[SPEAKER_00]: learn to water right before that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will develop a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will become very comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to look and you'll go,
oh, they're going to want water pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will become natural to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your roots are developed in that
pot is full of roots, you'll notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: they really, they will tolerate being too
wet more than they will too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be something that you'll
start to notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of this stuff just comes from
developing a relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it comes from developing a
relationship with one specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say dial it in, grow one plant
over and over again, learn your cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn your plant, learn your watering
system, then expand from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you do, whatever I say,
whatever you learn, wherever you read it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep in mind the plants are the boss,
all the monitors, all of the equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't make a difference if you've got a
moisture content sensor in there and it
[SPEAKER_00]: says there's plenty of water and that
plant says, bullshit, the plant is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That monitor doesn't know what that plant
likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dial it in, pay attention to the
plants, pick up your plants, keep an eye
[SPEAKER_00]: on them and you will learn exactly when to
water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you are worried about
overwatering, you are probably in too
[SPEAKER_00]: large of a container and the roots weren't
ready to go so big.
