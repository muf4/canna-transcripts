[SPEAKER_01]: If you're watching on the YouTube channel,
I'm sure you can see by now that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: joined by white Mike, welcome to the show,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everybody's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought Mike on to do what I'm going to
call the legalization presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the part of the show where we
usually talk about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna ask you, Mike, what are you
smoking on today, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to join some flower from one of
our local dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent flower from a local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your perfectly vague descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that's what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's solid herb, solid herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard one of the newer outfits in town
had some good flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and checked it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumors seem to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you go back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gummies I like they have a for a few bucks
cheaper a bottle than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their flowers good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get some of my money for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit having flower on the shelf right now
is a selling point.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the dispensaries are picked
pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of shelves are pretty empty
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know what's there's been kind of
disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having somebody that had several nice
looking selections was a pleasure to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought I would see empty shelves
at this time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't seen something like that in
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scary going into the dispensary right
now with minimal selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you enjoying right now,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am dabbing on garlic banger number nine
live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you guys know Green Dot is one of
my favorites for concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, anything with the word
garlic in it is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The garlic banger is a blend of head
banger and HSB.
[SPEAKER_01]: HSB is Han Solo burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The package describes the flavor as
garlic, sour and gas on the back of the
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says 69.12% THC and non detectable CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the garlic banger, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my probably top five
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I've been dabbing it,
I can't think of anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the other top four
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's perfect concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the mind erasing and delicious
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful fucking description
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The garlic banger number nine,
there are two different numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's number six and number nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't decide which one I like better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, let me get myself back on
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you a bunch of time and
a bunch of space to do your legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You contribute to the show heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have contributed behind the scenes
heavily to my cannabis career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without White Mike's involvement,
without some of the foundation and bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: that you laid, my towers wouldn't be
standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do appreciate it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely I notice it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't go unnoticed when I start
thinking about the past and the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been like a decade now we've been
building it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been playing together for quite a
while and it has been a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been some scary moments, some rocky roads,
but we always seem to do pretty well
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving into the old place, I found some
relics from way back in the origin days
[SPEAKER_00]: and they all make me smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the smile just when you said
relics, I got excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding spots for them in the new house is
a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old business cards and old pictures and
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of your ivory cards from the
metamar days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a it was a caregiver card with your
number across the back and I smiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I wonder if this is the first
one that might have been, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metamar days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been teasing that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: let Mike have a bunch of space in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I bring Mike on and I talk over him
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to steer the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to steer the show very
minimally.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I catch Mike out in left field,
I will bring him back onto the train
[SPEAKER_01]: tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I catch him too far off the microphone,
I will glue his face back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to stay up on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying not to sneeze into my
microphone right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excuse me if it does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of listeners have been asking for
guidance on how to get into legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to start joining city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, where do I start to get to
where you guys are now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I understand and appreciate and
are grateful for the fact that we're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: location where we can drive to a store
that's four minutes away and pay cash
[SPEAKER_01]: money for the top quality concentrates and
not have to worry about police taking it
[SPEAKER_01]: from us, getting arrested, anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of freedom here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike has been given the opportunity to
put together what I'm calling the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization presentation just because I
like silly shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I gave him some time to put something
together and I'm giving him the format.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to stay out of the way
and not over talk you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just going to shut up now and say,
Mike, the mic is yours, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck and have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's time for the white Mike's
legalization presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have at it, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeners, before we dive into this,
it's kind of hard to know how far to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into some of these topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been studying legalization or the
idea of it in one way or another for like
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different talking
points and arguments just sort of rattling
[SPEAKER_00]: around in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to hone it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to hone it down to sort of the
key starter package for what does anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's interested need to know to be
effective arguing for legalization in
[SPEAKER_00]: their area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've done a good job in narrowing
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more information or would have
appreciated less information, you can hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me up on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at NemoPunk15 on Twitter or you can
find me on Facebook at Pueblo for sensible
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis laws or you can get a hold of me
by emailing the show links provided in the
[SPEAKER_00]: show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting into this argument right
now, you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of good data to pull
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of other people's work to
build on and study and sort of repurpose
[SPEAKER_00]: for your own arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite like 80 years of propaganda and
bullshit and drug war nonsense that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: built on top of cannabis, we've got a lot
of positives working in our favor for this
[SPEAKER_00]: argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition as a concept is just crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to first prohibition,
this is one of my favorite arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I steal it from a guy named Neil Franklin,
who's the founder of a group called Law
[SPEAKER_00]: Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a group of ex-cops and judges that just
saw prohibition in action and can't
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they formed a group to fight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: His little comment was the very first
prohibition is God telling Adam and Eve,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't eat that apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: God was the cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only had to watch two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that apple got ate quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little human nature in that
story too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only this prohibition, not a very good
policy and it's hard to enforce,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's sort of human nature to go,
oh, don't touch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just, you tell us not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing our brain does is I
wonder why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm going to try it and find out why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when little old me, when they
instituted D.A.R.E., when I was in fifth
[SPEAKER_00]: or sixth grade or whenever they gave it to
us, the first thing everyone in my class
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was, well, they're probably
telling us about this because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should go find it and try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was weird then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was in college and saw some
studies where they looked at if D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_00]: worked and they found that the D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_00]: that we went through was zero to negative
two percent effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every hundred kids that went
through the D.A.R.E., I went through two
[SPEAKER_00]: of them that wouldn't have gone out to
look for drugs were like, we should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably go try some drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking to get in and start
arguing against cannabis prohibition in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area, know that you're not alone and
that it's not a craziest argument as it
[SPEAKER_00]: might originally seem, especially if you
come from a lot of the properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: Paganda that we grew up in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know for a fact is still pretty
prevalent around the country, even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, where it seems like
legalization is right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seemed like that since 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, prohibition is a terrible policy
on its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, cops were never meant to protect
you from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were meant to protect you from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I go beat up Jeff, the cops can
arrest me for beating up Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I beat up me and I tell the cops I
kick my own ass, they're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at me and go, well, what do you want
us to do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing with drug laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trying to catch somebody who doesn't
want to be caught and doesn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: report the other people involved is just a
really hard crime to solve because nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves a typical pot deal upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody wanted to buy some marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody wanted to sell some marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two connected and both left happy or
at least not disgruntled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it doesn't always work that
way because prohibition doesn't create an
[SPEAKER_00]: awesomely safe marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in theory, both parties are there for
their own ends and those ends get met
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and everybody goes home happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like an assault where there's
somebody that got their ass kicked that's
[SPEAKER_00]: salty about it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No victim, no crime is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moralists or prohibitionists love to
paint, you know, it's a moral failing or
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of other nonsense on the why
smoking a joint in the privacy of your own
[SPEAKER_00]: home should be really, really terrible and
a crime that needs to be prevented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Punished, not prevented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start breaking down,
especially now where I mean, Colorado has
[SPEAKER_00]: been legal for eight years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law passed in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of 2013 was a planning year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stores have been open since 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's six years we've had dispensary
retail dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had medical dispensary since 08.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali's had medical dispensary since 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And society hasn't tipped over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't gone insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try as they might, you can't pin a lot of
mayhem on legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Canada followed Colorado and
Washington state in legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is Mexico now, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're clearly headed towards a world where
cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, there's a lot of good
data that you can draw on to make your
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments much more impactful than mine
were when I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I started, a lot of this was
theoretical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you were trying to explain to
people that if there's a legal market,
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market kind of goes away,
they'd look at you funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can show them that that's
where $7 billion worth of cannabis sales
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legal market around the US right
now, those aren't new customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're existing customers spending
dollars they would have spent anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just choosing to shop in a
regulated market now.
[SPEAKER_01]: $7 billion?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an old number even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably 9 or 11 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good estimates on the... It's easier to
know the size of the cosmetics market or
[SPEAKER_00]: the dental market in the US because the
sales figures are easier to track.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA has been putting out estimates
every year since the 70s, estimating the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of different drug markets in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put the US cannabis market
somewhere north of 35 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really old number.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is it's closer to 50 to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are prohibition dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a huge markup because it's
an illegal product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you figured about a third of that,
so 25, 30 billion dollars, is what the US
[SPEAKER_00]: market is potentially for legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now the legal market's about 11
billion strong, I think, 10 or 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of black market money
still on the table for the legal market to
[SPEAKER_00]: scoop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was first making this argument,
it was hard to get all that information in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet didn't exist like it does
today even.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have people like me coaching
you on podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data wasn't there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in libraries, you had trouble finding
books about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the landscape is vastly different
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all plays to our benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're arguing to someone who is
staunchly anti-legalization, they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to a lot of these arguments and
talking points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know that you're not just a crazy
hippie shouting nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's kind of what it felt like
when I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a real sense that you had to
overcome the chichen chong kind of veil
[SPEAKER_00]: that automatically got thrown over you as
soon as you said, I'm here to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd go, phew, hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just immediately, you had to overcome
tons of bullshit because you were the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not so true anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not nearly as true as it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a lot more firepower and
it's way easier to back it up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things you're going to want to
do if you're going to start arguing for
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization in your area my biggest tip
for you is to just learn and read and
[SPEAKER_00]: watch as much as you can on cannabis,
cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just type in cannabis documentaries
into YouTube you're going to find dozens
[SPEAKER_00]: of good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen, hit pause real quick,
go grab a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples that you're definitely going
to want to familiarize yourself with if
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subtitle, The Business Behind Getting
High.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that on YouTube for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with a documentary called The
Culture High.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure Waiting to Inhale is still
available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, I know you can find it
searching on the internet for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're more of a reader, check out a
book called My Medicine by a guy named
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban Rosenfeld.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you an insider's view of the very
earliest days of medical marijuana in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a story almost nobody knows about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you tell people they think you're
fucking with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government's run a medical
marijuana program since 1982 where they
[SPEAKER_00]: mail people tins with I think it's 11
ounces per tin in pre-rolled joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even saying it right now, it sounds like
I'm making shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the testimonials from these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of history to draw from now
that just wasn't accessible when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absorb, read, and learn everything you can
and get used to thinking of the arguments
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're hearing people make in terms
of where you would like to see the law
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching a documentary,
say, the union, a lot of it's set in
[SPEAKER_00]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one's from 2004, 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, one of the hotspots for
cannabis production was British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the desirable selling points for
flour in the country was this is from
[SPEAKER_00]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole documentary details what the
black market's like in that point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they're talking, take the numbers
they're saying and apply them to your town
[SPEAKER_00]: or your city or your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start conveying this information
to other people in your area and pointing
[SPEAKER_00]: to different data sets that are publicly
available, those arguments are extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can say, our town has 160,000
people in it, if we were to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, the numbers say that we would
be making around a million a year between
[SPEAKER_00]: sales tax and licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we allowed production as well,
we'd be looking at another million or so
[SPEAKER_00]: in excise tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, your city councilman who
didn't really want to listen to the stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: guy again today is thinking, well,
that's $2.5 million that I could put
[SPEAKER_00]: towards this pet project or that pet
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, you've got them hooked
and your argument a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're reading and learning and
watching everything you can on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and prohibition, also check out local
meetings in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend start local.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never argued in front of a
governing body before, don't start at a
[SPEAKER_00]: state legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at a town meeting or a city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: These meetings are open to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a plague on in the whole
world's upside down because of COVID,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these are open on the web now and
they're very easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two minutes on Google and you're able to
find when your city council or town
[SPEAKER_00]: committee or whatever they're called meet,
what time and day the meetings are,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to view them remotely, and watch a lot
of that, as much as you can stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most boring shit you'll ever see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my superpower is being able to sit
through these meetings and not die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the skill set that I bring to the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to go down to city council
and say, city council, we should break
[SPEAKER_00]: with 100 years now of tradition and
legalize cannabis, here's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that message to be well-received
and appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your best bet is to watch a lot of city
council meetings or if you want to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: state assembly, a state assembly meeting,
and get used to how those meetings are
[SPEAKER_00]: run, what the flow is, what all the
procedures are, who all the players are,
[SPEAKER_00]: who does what, who says what, what order
things happen in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of people go and look very
foolish because they go with zero
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation and 100 percent passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the taking the time and sitting
through meeting after meeting about zoning
[SPEAKER_00]: code and fire code and watching the little
old lady speak about people speeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: our street or the loud music at night or
watching the big city presentation where a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole block of people have come down to
rally because too many garbage trucks go
[SPEAKER_00]: down their alley every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really get a feel for how your city
runs, who the important players are,
[SPEAKER_00]: who the decision-makers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you watch, the more you learn
what those people care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really tailor your arguments and
make them effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say somebody's really passionate about the
police and they want the police to
[SPEAKER_00]: reinvest more time into more important
type crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can point out that in Colorado,
a state with 5.7 million people,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have 6,000 fewer marijuana arrests per
year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 6,000, hey, I caught Mike and Jeff
smoking a joint behind the Arby's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to handcuff them, pat them down,
put them in the back of the squad car,
[SPEAKER_00]: take them to the jail, process them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a minor offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do some paperwork, we take some
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go home seven hours later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes about three hours of the officer's
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that 6,000 times a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those man hours add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the math, the normal 40 hours or
work week is 2,080 hours a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work five days a week, 40 hours a
week, or not five days a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: but 40 hours a week and 52 weeks a year,
it's 2,080.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6,000 arrests at two or three hours per
arrest, it's 12,000 to 18,000 man hours we
[SPEAKER_00]: just freed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many rapes can you solve in that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many murders can you solve in that
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody is on the other side of that
particular coin and is fired up about
[SPEAKER_00]: police abuse of power, 90% of the videos
where the cop pulls somebody over and
[SPEAKER_00]: decides to fuck with that somebody,
it starts with, Jeff, I smell marijuana in
[SPEAKER_00]: your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you please step out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, I smell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never smell meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never smell heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rarely smell alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, I smell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smell weed, there's no longer reason
to fuck with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes that off the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's got a passion project where
they want to fund something, the data is
[SPEAKER_00]: there now where you can look up and say,
there's this many people in our city.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use the numbers in Colorado,
then there's no reason to say they
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't apply to say New York or Wyoming
or Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That our area could likely see this much
money coming in every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could put that towards whatever we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, you've got a bunch of
people who started off not wanting to even
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're thinking about, we're already
buying and selling the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who wants it gets it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition is such a terrible policy that
it's literally created a marketplace where
[SPEAKER_00]: every high school has a distribution
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't dream up a worse distribution
system than the one Prohibition created.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were trying to keep drugs out of
the hands of people who shouldn't be on
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition is bad in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you learn about the history of
cannabis prohibition, the medical effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, the health effects of
cannabis, what's happened in states since
[SPEAKER_00]: they've legalized or since they've allowed
medical, and how much it costs to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: enforce all this and prohibit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really easy to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to this meeting for 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured out what this guy and this guy
really care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to sway their votes my way now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to tailor the argument like
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just about doing your prep
work and knowing who your target audience
[SPEAKER_00]: is and then getting comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch the proceedings enough,
you'll get comfortable enough to know when
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to do your five-minute spiel on
why your area should legalize pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just about the prep work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The documentaries now are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even exist when me and Jeff
were starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are spoiled now, and you're
welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some fun notes we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you all some fun numbers to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, the state of Colorado,
like I said, 5.7 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected $302,458,426 in cannabis
taxes in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every report I've read this year says our
sales numbers are way higher during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to crush that number this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: $302 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, for example, has got 8.3 million
people, almost 8.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at a projected revenue of
436 million a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get on the legalization train,
they continually fumble the ball trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: craft the perfect legalization model
rather than letting, what's the phrase?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're letting the perfect get in the way
of the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than making any progress,
they keep talking about how next year
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to make the perfect leap
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the cop hours that we could save
different ways you can argue for
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization in your area if you don't
want to go sacrifice yourself on the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate city council like I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Writing op-eds to your local paper or a
larger paper is super, super easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things you should know that will make
you more confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every newspaper has an op-ed section,
and they're desperate for free content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The odds your letter gets published are
pretty good if you follow a few really
[SPEAKER_00]: simple rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on their submission criteria,
which will be easy to find on their
[SPEAKER_00]: paper's website, you can go to the Denver
Post, click the opinion section,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you scroll to the bottom,
there will be a tab that says submit an
[SPEAKER_00]: op-ed, and it'll tell you here's your word
limit, don't cuss, don't make it personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, there's like an 85% chance
they'll publish your letter, doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be bitching about the ducks at
the city park, or the people driving fast
[SPEAKER_00]: down your street, or different marijuana
laws in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another important piece of
information, most newspapers have no way
[SPEAKER_00]: to double check who your name is on the
bottom of the letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can write a letter and say my
name's Jeff, and they'll publish it saying
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff wrote it, and then Jeff will call me
and be like, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to submit a letter under
my name, tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to use your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's famous examples of people in our
history who wrote wonderful, impactful
[SPEAKER_00]: op-eds to the paper under pseudonyms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Benjamin Franklin famously did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But op-eds are really kind of oddly
powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2020, and we all decided to be dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most people can't tell the
difference between a fact-investigated
[SPEAKER_00]: report and an opinion letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your opinion letter to the editor
is already going to have more impact than
[SPEAKER_00]: it probably should, because it's an
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody can tell that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing with writing op-eds is
they get picked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a lot of clicks on the local
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get picked up by the national
outlet, and other people will discuss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, elected officials are
being asked, did you see the op-ed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday's paper that, you know,
from Ross to Jeff that said we should
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that, Mayor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, it's a major news
story that's generating more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: people saw it and got to read your
arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other big tip is stay informed as much
as possible on what's going on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: local area, in your city, in your state,
and nationally, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly arguing for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The places that haven't moved in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway on legalization are almost
exclusively places now where someone in
[SPEAKER_00]: elected office has to submit a bill to
change the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general public can't put a petition
together and get it on the ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to convince somebody that
holds elective office to submit the change
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do that by pestering the fuck out
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day, every week, every month,
however often you can, send that person an
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call their office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to remind you, if marijuana were
legal, we'd have an extra this much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state budget this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I saw you wanted more money for snow
removal in district one next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can't find it in the budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just contact me next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep sending emails, keep calling,
keep pestering those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make your arguments short,
concise, and tuned to their cares and
[SPEAKER_00]: their wants and needs, you're going to
have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to take as long as you
think it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so lucky now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've overcome so much of the shit and
baggage that we've been carrying in this
[SPEAKER_00]: movement for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet finally freed up enough
information, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show's like this, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's about what I've got
straightened or lined out so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any questions for me,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only note I wrote down,
and this is kind of, it's related,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have any favorite activists that we
should follow or listen to or people that
[SPEAKER_01]: can give us some guidance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely follow Marijuana Moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can subscribe to a newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check in with a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow those guys on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic cannabis reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russ Belleville, if you're really into
data, Russ is one of the best data miners
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radical Russ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radical Russ will dig into some talking
point, like a fucking honey badger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then post all the data for free to his
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's a marijuana talking
point that you really want to deep dive
[SPEAKER_00]: data on but don't really feel like doing
all that legwork yourself, you can check
[SPEAKER_00]: in with Radical Russ and see if he's
already done it for you and wants to point
[SPEAKER_00]: you in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely check those documentaries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the website I listed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check in with your local normal office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out law enforcement against
prohibition or LEAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some interesting stuff around the
country every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good advocacy work about all sorts
of stuff, not just prohibition being
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible policy, but lots of law
enforcement reform stuff type two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow me on Twitter, you'll see me
retweeting a lot of their stuff or a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of their members' stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike tweets a lot of great cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just follow Mike on Twitter for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will give you a good heads up on
things to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Twitter is pretty good for staying
informed on cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Nemopunk15 on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the guy a follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I see you scrolling through your
notes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we covered everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it time to start wrapping up the?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I hit all the talking parts I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can definitely be part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some little notes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Jeff are in a city called Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our population is about 160,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our little city that has eight
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number is from when we only had seven
up and running in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see better than a million in taxes and
fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not production or excise taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just seven stores doing their daily
business, paying sales tax on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and paying their licensing fees to
operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an insane number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a million bucks that goes into the
economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new fire station, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could at least build a structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could build a damn fire station.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what a fire station costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into city and state budgets,
the numbers get really big quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's pulling in 300 million plus in
marijuana taxes every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 1% of our state budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two numbers in your head are hard to
hold at the same time, at least for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: $300 million, if I had that personally,
my life would be cushed for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I did expensive dumb shit every
day, 300 million is enough to get me
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be competitively trying to spend
through that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the state level, it doesn't go that
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you figure out how much a highway
costs to build or a school system costs to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain, it's the law of large numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's this many of us, shit just
costs a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're making it, especially the
economic argument, keep in mind that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be a golden parachute,
magic bullet, but that money can do so
[SPEAKER_00]: much good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here locally, a huge chunk of the money we
collect goes towards scholarships where
[SPEAKER_00]: any kid can get, it's a couple of
thousand, I think it's 4,000 now,
[SPEAKER_00]: any local kid that graduates high school
in Pueblo can apply for a scholarship and
[SPEAKER_00]: get four grand as long as they go to one
of the local colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're opening it up so that it can be any
college in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they would have done that
originally, more kids wouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a minute for the program to really
get up and running and really get funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, they're giving away almost
700,000 a year in scholarships.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a community like Pueblo, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of middle schools down
here where they didn't have sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a road where the cars drive
and then field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's houses and it's in the middle of a
semi-suburban area, but they hadn't gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: around to having the money to pave the
sidewalks yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very real way, kids were walking in
the street with bus and car traffic to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to school every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids that walked and rode their bike
had to do so on the same road as the buses
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super unsafe, but it's all we could afford
until we legalized pot and we had some
[SPEAKER_00]: extra revenue laying around that wasn't
already earmarked for some desperate need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those schools have nice safe
sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of parks got refurbished.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, a park.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the people who use that,
that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a two and a five-year-old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little park up the street that I drove
by and never considered for 35 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: that bitch is vital now, like sunshine and
water vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana taxes can pay to keep that up
and keep the equipment decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that you can use that money is
really big because it's brand new money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not money that's already allocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to take it from Jeff to
give it to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brand new money coming into the flow
that you can allocate anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a bunch of ancillary money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is there sales tax, but you and I
have a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people work in the cannabis
industry in our town?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those people are now employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now buy dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now buy groceries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now buy from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the economy move.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,300 or 1,400 people in Pueblo,
it's a shitload of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a massive amount of investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When an area goes legal, in Pueblo here,
I think it was 50 some million in
[SPEAKER_00]: investment that first year, the 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifty-two million, I think was the number
in just one year in economic investment
[SPEAKER_00]: down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that meant for the electricians and
the HVAC tax and the drywall crews and the
[SPEAKER_00]: roofing crews, all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 2012 wasn't exactly an economic
boom time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: This money flowing into Colorado honestly
saved a lot of small contracting
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned our town around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made Trinidad, Colorado a different
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: That place used to be dusty and barely
existing and no disrespect, it was falling
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was old and dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of reports on exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you can just Google what legal pot
did to Trinidad, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least one really good interview
with their sheriff where he states,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was against it, but my hand was forced
and it's revitalized the town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places that went from an annual budget of
a couple of thousand have a budget of a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of million now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the little pocket above Colorado
Springs, the one with only two stores in
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Manitou Springs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this little gem in Colorado where it
was like locals, it was the cool spot to
[SPEAKER_00]: take your date when you were 25 in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little hippie spot, little mountain
hippie town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful food, great scene, great place
to hang out in the spring and fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: but super duper poor, falling apart,
crumbling, hadn't seen reinvestment or
[SPEAKER_00]: attacks when falling 30 years,
50 years, some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two marijuana stores that they
allow and the taxes they bring in have
[SPEAKER_00]: paved most of the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crazy thing is, is this is all
business that's already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not business that we have to invent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just we're moving it from a black,
untaxed and unregulated market into a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you can do so much good with that
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: This town is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This town wasn't a super shitty town.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of on the verge of like,
is it going to make it or is it going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fall apart?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when cannabis came, people,
like I said, all those 13, 1400 people,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got jobs, but not only did they get
jobs, but there are owners and investors
[SPEAKER_01]: that show up in their BMWs and Porsches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come here and they want to eat here
and they don't want to eat at all the old
[SPEAKER_01]: and no offense to the old restaurants that
were here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to list them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to bash some of them,
but they don't want to eat at those
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want the fancy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the Riverwalk area has got all
kinds of new fancy restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the north end of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we go shopping has all kinds of new
cool places because the owners and their
[SPEAKER_01]: wives and their kids all want to go
shopping and do fancy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the owners are ladies too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made it that all of the owners are
men.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are ladies, but they want to
go shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get their food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting more stuff here because
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things used to close at like eight o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you get till 10 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's not extravagant,
but you get till 10 to get food now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the things that fucked with
me so much when I moved here, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: closing at seven 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But little by little and I legal cannabis
has so much to do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it was a magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo was on a slow decline and had been
for 30 or 40 years since the steel mill
[SPEAKER_00]: went from employing 50,000 to employing
5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, the town's been on a slow
decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal cannabis, we're on a slow incline
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're slowly working back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every couple of months, shit gets a tiny
bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like every six months, you'll notice,
oh, there's a new restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a new florist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a new dentist office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just little by little by little,
the whole city's coming back and legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is the lifeblood doing it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is local talk here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the locals will love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I are in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs is the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was an hour north of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now since cannabis is happening,
it's 45 minutes north of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Pueblo is moving north and Colorado
Springs is moving south.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to devour the town in the
middle called Fountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to eat it up and spit it
out pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to high five in Fountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll be like, where are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the north end of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll cross, drive 20 feet and be in
Colorado Springs because cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing, it's got the economy going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a whole new music scene
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a refurbished music scene here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a really cool club that wouldn't
be here without the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it's brought us a lot of
great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Economic incline, jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that have jobs in the cannabis
industry would be doing, a lot of us would
[SPEAKER_01]: just be doing crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that age bracket, demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we went from the black market to
doing it on a time clock, paying taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it under cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no good count on how many people
the black market for cannabis employs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take the numbers I was given
earlier, the 35 to $50 billion range,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the same size as the cosmetics
market in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about all the lipstick and
the eyeliner and the rouge and the lip
[SPEAKER_00]: gloss and the fucking shampoo and lotion
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take all the people it takes to
make all those products and to market
[SPEAKER_00]: those products and distribute them and put
them on store shelves and to check you out
[SPEAKER_00]: at the register.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all that same amount of
people, but they're illegal pot growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dealers and traffickers and movers and
smugglers and shippers and yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a more entertainment version
of like why prohibition is a bad idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought it's the 10th anniversary
of Boardwalk Empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking fantastic HBO show on alcohol
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can always count on Mike to wrap it
back around to an HBO show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an oldie but a goodie
checkout weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just show away before it's time from
Showtime weeds gave me a panic attack,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I said I was gonna let you have a
lot of Yeah, I said I was gonna give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of space in the show, but I'm gonna
butt in with this weed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up my adolescent time my teenage
years, I was doing her job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing her hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was buying cheap and selling high buying
in bulk and selling and selling small and
[SPEAKER_01]: making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched Nancy Botwin make so many
fucking day one stupid mistakes that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would I would be yelling at my fucking TV
you're fucking and I did I would be
[SPEAKER_01]: panicking like the cops are coming Nancy
like that show that lady made me so
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking nervous dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it's my favorite example when
people try to attack legalization in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado because one of the the negative
numbers that's gone up a little is the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last couple of years since
legalization, the cops are busting a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger number of grows, but possession and
consumption arrests are down by 6000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it went up by like 150 but it
went down by 6000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they talk about growing pot in the
house and a trap house like it's a new
[SPEAKER_00]: concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fucking hit TV show back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a clue from the busts that I have
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it televised or talked about on
the news broadcasted shared whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a word for it that I'm missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen most of those are from
people who came from other places because
[SPEAKER_01]: they thought let's go to Colorado weeds
legal they didn't even bother to they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't read the rule book.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed up and they hung up lights and
fucking planted a bunch of seeds or bought
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of clones and got going didn't
realize the legal doesn't have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They the black market operates the that's
how they produce their product is they
[SPEAKER_00]: they try to grow it somewhere where they
don't think anyone will know or care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess in Florida because a lot of
growers when they first started busting
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal house grows were from Florida
wasn't going to say it but I let you do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They published down in the papers in the
news publish Colorado legalized cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: but they didn't smart ass stealing my
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had six months of meetings where
everybody in town learned what the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to be first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they thought they could get away with
just renting the place and filling it with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that saw it was like wait a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember no city meeting or some
no notice saying they were going to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana business there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that's shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stand like a sore thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not blend in at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an update.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fire department cost $400 per square
foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to check.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the mill was pretty low for a
fire department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those fire trucks cost like half a
mill piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Houses are houses are a mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like yeah like not not this one but I
mean like you know there are a million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar houses a few blocks from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's way more fire departments got
technology in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're way off track Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I was going to keep us out of the
fucking woods today out of the corn maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a good job on your legalization
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure people are going to have a lot of
questions for those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire off all the questions you want folks.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com is the
best way to send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contact Mike through the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave comments on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike will go check the YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got access to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah leave us some feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of just interrupted you and cut you
off while pulling us out of the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any more some of those Mike's
final moments or any shit you want to add
[SPEAKER_01]: to this before I start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: No just be kind to each other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study study study if you want to be a
cannabis advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's nice now that we've gotten rid
of a lot of the baggage that came with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take your time and do your homework
you won't have too much of an uphill
[SPEAKER_00]: battle becoming a cannabis advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know that once you do it that's sort of
your cross for life though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be a preschool teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will always be Googleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Google my full name and the city
that I'm in and it will come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: reports of me and city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to see my picture on the
front of the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the very first times I went and
spoke at a public meeting they had me on
[SPEAKER_00]: the very front page of the chieftain the
next fucking morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man how nerve-wracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it was just a reminder that the the
squeaky wheel gets greased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love waking up to text messages and
calls like hey bro you're in the paper
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like oh what the fuck did I do and it's
just a picture of me looking blazed as
[SPEAKER_01]: shit at city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey I'm here bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah they took a picture of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lady resigned at city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like I'd like to announce today that
this is my last meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am resigning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stepping down from my position and a
lot of people I didn't I wasn't too
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in city council but I knew at the
time that people hated her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like I've seen posters about
basically fuck this lady and she just quit
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I made this face of like oh fuck
she just quit and they took a picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: me right as I was like oh damn that bitch
just quit in front of everybody and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just posted that picture on the fucking
newspaper and I was like oh that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: dumbass picture of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole incident taught me a lot about
local politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our local trash companies and it's
not like they're a special business or
[SPEAKER_00]: they had magical resources or a lot of
people or employees to pull upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just two or three people that got
really pissed about something and spent
[SPEAKER_00]: enough time on Facebook and talking to
people in their life to get 25 or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: people to show up on a Monday night like
every other Monday night for like seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight times and so it took a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot of people showing up over
and over and over again but after two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three months of this group showing up
every week or every other week when they
[SPEAKER_00]: met their message got heard and I think
three people resigned like it was a major
[SPEAKER_00]: overhaul of city government at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: In retrospect I really should have gone
for one of the open seats but I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really taught me that politics is all
perception and if you can get it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: take that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get 15 or 20 or 30 people to
show up and if you can all do something
[SPEAKER_00]: the same you'll really scare the shit out
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can all wear neon green t-shirts
or royal blue t-shirts they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have to say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to take the time to
throw a stencil across it and print like
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't like how you haul trash or
legalize pot or whatever on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just all be neon green and high
you know me and all the people in matching
[SPEAKER_00]: shirts behind me are here to say we should
legalize pot and we're gonna come back
[SPEAKER_00]: every week and say that until you do and
the first week everybody's like sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: are and the next meeting everybody's like
oh they came back he and by the fifth
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting they're like fuck like what
happens if more people start showing up is
[SPEAKER_00]: because the news was talking to that guy
before the meeting and you know I saw him
[SPEAKER_00]: last after the last meeting I'm the news
too all of a sudden your little group and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your issue is is getting major
major time during the conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when shit really changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado tried to legalize before we got
it done and we failed hard and but we
[SPEAKER_00]: moved the conversation and now that we are
where we are as a country like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: there it's if if places like New York and
New Jersey can convince their legislators
[SPEAKER_00]: that getting legalization done in one form
or another is important even if we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get it perfect we can always go back and
adjust if we can get movement in one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two more states we were it's over we're
there nice that's a good spot to start
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapping it up Mike let's leave an
