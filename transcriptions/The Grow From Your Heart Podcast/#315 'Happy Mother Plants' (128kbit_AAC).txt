conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who is just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, let's talk about
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by a mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: A mother plant is a plant that I plan on
keeping around perpetually and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: clones off of and using those clones for
my production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on keeping that mother plant in the
mother area or the veg room forever and
[SPEAKER_00]: not flowering her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got those genetics around so
that I can always grow that same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got reliable clones of something
that I've grown that is tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: tried and true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how long to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what to feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what not to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a mother plant is a plant you keep
around with intentions of cutting clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from it and growing that strain over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a mother plant from just about
any plant that you acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's tested and you like it,
you can keep it as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got a clone from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got a clone from your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you grew out a seed and you really
liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep a clone of that alive forever
and not flower it and you can dedicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that as your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about keeping mother plants
and caring for your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things is keeping your
mother plant in good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put them in decent soil,
bagged soil from the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy the most expensive
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't going to be super high
performing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to keep them healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add about 50% perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If what you're buying isn't well aerated,
add some perlite to it, the big chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite or the small perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're putting a lot of air in
there, you will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So decent soil or a soilless mix like a
peat based mix with a lot of perlite for
[SPEAKER_00]: your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want a semi big pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go any smaller than a three
gallon pot, probably a five or maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, but I know you don't have a lot of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a three gallon,
you're not going to be able to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant around as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to clone it and
replace it eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can put it in a five,
you can keep it alive for a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start to get root bound and
you're going to have to do something about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I like those air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen the pots that look like they
are kind of like a waffle maker on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great for mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can open those up and you can prune
those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like a big pot, either an air pot or
a root pot or a big pot for a mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because that plant's going to grow large
and you need to get it big enough to take
[SPEAKER_00]: however many clones your production is
going to be if it's six because you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado or I guess you'd be at five now
because you've already got your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It limits you down to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're going to run a production,
you need to get that many clones off of
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a large pot to
grow the plant as large as you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a large pot full of good soil
with a bunch of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to want to put your plant
under 18 to 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have the mother plants under 18
to 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants I've noticed when they start
to get root bound, if they get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit big and you've only got them under 18
or 20 hours of light, they will try to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get mad that they're root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get big enough and they'll think,
hey, it is time for me to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to prevent that, maybe have a larger
pot and also keep it on 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that your plants need
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good compromise there is maybe 20 on and
four off and see what starts to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant starts to auto flower,
if you see it making pistols, then it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time to put that plant on 24 hours of
light and start feeding it a nice heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, a veg nutrient with a lot of nitrogen
and then also maybe increase the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light that you're giving it and also the
duration of light you're giving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will bring it out of that
flowering phase back to veg for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they do start to auto flower,
put them on 24 and keep them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to happen with more sativa
dominant, more tropical type strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to take as much light to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to keep them on 24 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 18 to 24, maybe 18 on six off,
maybe 19 on five off, maybe 20 on four
[SPEAKER_00]: off, or maybe just go straight up 24 hours
on and don't ever give them darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what your plants respond to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything likes time to sleep,
but maybe your mother plants flower if you
[SPEAKER_00]: give them too much nap time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just a couple hours will work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got big pots filled
with good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how long to keep the light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about what to feed
our mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using bottled nutrients,
just a basic veg nutrients, if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg A, the veg B, use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the recommended dosage, every once in a
week or so, you're going to want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: some Kalmag, so you don't get any Kalmag
deficiencies, and maybe add a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're going to take clones,
when you know that you're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: clones in a couple of days, maybe spray
them with a kelp product, and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: help the plants with a little bit of vigor
when you cut the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basic veg nutrients, maybe some
microbes to keep that root zone strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything growing fast, and then maybe a
little bit of Kalmag occasionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some kelp with the feed,
and then maybe kelp as a foliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you really have to do is keep these
plants strong and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't give them too much food because
then they're going to grow too fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads me into topping and shaping
for the maximum amount of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to top plants at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to the podcast
for a long time, we've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not sure on how to top a plant,
I'll give a quick talk on it because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need to know how to do
this to make good mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first clone that you can take out of
your plants is that main plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main top, your plant's going to grow
up, it's going to branch out, it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow taller, it's going to branch out
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that main top is going to get taller
than everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab that main top and take it down,
follow it down with your hand until you
[SPEAKER_00]: bend it over and it looks like you've got
a nice even canopy toward the next four
[SPEAKER_00]: tops, the next four branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of come up to an even point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut out that main top, you'll be
able to see where you can create a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: even canopy of four big heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll take out that one big main stalk
and you'll create four even tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a nice mother plant that's
going to create four nice even tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to clone that first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my first clone comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that in the cloner, I make that one
root, I put it in a small pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I flower that and I see what I've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is a good plant, then I keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've already got a mother plant ready
to give me a bunch of clones for a
[SPEAKER_00]: production run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a male, I can throw that one away
and I can throw away the mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I guess would have been a father
plant at that point, but it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're going in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a problem, I throw that one
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw it to a corresponding donor plant
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first clone is the one that makes me
decide if I want to run that plant again
[SPEAKER_00]: or lets me know if I've got a boy or a
girl or if I've got a problematic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also starts shaping the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've now taken the main stalk out and I've
started shaping that plant to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my first clone off of my mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I like to go to the bottom and those
bottom branches, not the weak shitty ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the first ones that are kind of stout,
they come up kind of far, those become my
[SPEAKER_00]: next two clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got three clones already off of
kind of a small mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those three clones, at least one of
those is going to live for me and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have something to grow or sometimes I
do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I keep that clone as the next
mother plant so that I've got something
[SPEAKER_00]: small to start so that I've got some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need it right away because I've
already got a crop in progress,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take the big plant that the clone
came from and flower that big one since
[SPEAKER_00]: it's already so grown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just depends on the situation
and how much room I've gotten,
[SPEAKER_00]: what my goal is, which one I decide to
keep, either the clone or the grown out
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I decide which one to flower based on
my situation, but that's a good way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I've got three clones off of a
very small mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can let that plant grow and as
those bottom branches start growing out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll reach up to the tops and the tops
will start reaching up to the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take those tops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find the top of the branch that you
want to make a clone and follow it down
[SPEAKER_00]: with your fingers until you hit that
intersection where there's a Y and right
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are two branches coming out
there and you would cut out the peace sign
[SPEAKER_00]: part, the part that makes it a peace sign,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow your finger down,
you're the middle of the peace sign,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'll come to the intersection where
two come up, then make the peace sign,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that middle of the peace sign out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got in the future,
those two that are sticking up are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to become the next two tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn to that one top into two tops and
now you're multiplying the tops on your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you've got extra time in the
grow, even if you don't need clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are, those mother plants are
getting tall, go through there and cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them at those intersections, top them and
make a nice even hedge out of your mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let them keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do need clones off of
one plant, you could be able to get 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50, maybe even 75 to a hundred clones off
of one mother plant, depending on how big
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is, what strain it is,
what size pot it is, what kind of light
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got it under and how well you've
been taking care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of leads me into the next
part I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part about mother
plants is just keeping them healthy and
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need healthy and clean mother plants
because that is the foundation of your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything starts with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got spider mites on your mother
plants, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your clones have spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your veg plants will have spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your flowering plants, before they
even made it to the flower room,
[SPEAKER_00]: they already are problems and you're
struggling from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if they're not healthy and you take
clones, the clones are going to be weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take longer to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be more prone to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be more prone to powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the production
that you deserve out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get everything dialed in
and these plants are still going to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit because the moms that they came
from were not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cutting the arm off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got, just think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bodybuilder and you cut
the arm off of that bodybuilder and you
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck it into some shit that made it grow
roots, you're going to have a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: fat, healthy bodybuilder arm to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be able to lift weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be able to push it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take some Harry Potter arm and you
cut it off and you stick it into some
[SPEAKER_00]: clone shit, you're going to have this
toothpick arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to make any weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be able to support
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you rather start with a beefy
bodybuilder arm?
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off with super healthy,
super happy, clean, strong mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most important parts of
a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it pest and problem free.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people overlook the importance of
a healthy veg environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg room is probably where you're
keeping your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend the few extra bucks and make that
room as top notch as your flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody spends all the money on the
bloom room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget the veg is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overlook that step.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk a little bit about
the lighting that you can use for your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, you can keep little tiny
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all you need is six clones,
you can keep a little one gallon pot with
[SPEAKER_00]: a little tiny plant that gives you six
little clones every time you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut it back really tiny to where
it's got one shoot on it and let that one
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot grow into six clones by the time you
need it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep them real tiny or you can
keep them real big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep them under a T5 if you don't
want them to get too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't need giant mother plants,
you could probably get plenty of clones by
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping your plants under a T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want them to grow super fast,
a T5 is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a home grow or you just need
clones every 60 days, you just need to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them to replace the batch that you're
gonna cut down, a T5 would be perfect for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A T5 could also work for you on a small
commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would just need a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have to spread the plants out a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get as tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, 315s, the ceramic metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Halides, you could use those for your
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would work just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are enough to keep the plants
growing, keep them vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep those on since they aren't as
powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The T5s and the 315s, I would keep those
on 24 hours a day just because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna need that much power to make sure
they do not auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the next light that I would
recommend maybe you could use an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any experience with LEDs,
but the LEDs make veg plants go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for mother plants, they would be highly
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you really want to step it up and
you want to have larger mother plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want a lot of productivity so that you
can make a lot of clones, I would say a
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 watt metal halide would be very
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the more light you're using,
the healthier your plants are gonna be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spider mites come around less when the
light is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants get less problems when the
light is stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So T5s, the 315 ceramic metal halides,
a good quality LED or a 400 watt metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halide, you could use a 600 or 1000 watt
metal halide if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use a double ended Gavita for a
mother plant if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, those are kind of overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights I listed before are probably
the most efficient for somebody with a
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a 400 watt for a commercial grow
would be good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we know about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know about pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how long to run the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about how to top and shape the
plants for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know to keep them healthy and keep the
bugs away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what kind of lighting to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully label your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to have more than one
mother plant, please carefully label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing more frustrating than
growing Stardog for seven weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing about seven weeks in that that's
Romulan Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been thinking all this time
that all those pictures you took were
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog and all the hype you had in your
head, it was Stardog and it's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit gets annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you label the plants very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you plan on giving clones
out, you don't want to give out clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to give out clones,
please label your mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: label your clones properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that I didn't want right
down that I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what you spray on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to spray what you would
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like if you were gentle and you
didn't use ridiculous pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're going to give clones out
from your mother plants, if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give clones out to people, let those
people know what you applied to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lie to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, whatever you spray on these mother
plants is going into your veg plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to end up in your flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about who is going to consume
this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a patient who has a
compromised immune system, if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient with a lung problem, if you've got
a patient who is allergic to something,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that in mind when you were treating
your mother plants for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to rant on that all the time,
but I want to keep people safe and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully label things, label your clones,
be honest about the pesticides that are
[SPEAKER_00]: put on your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to share clones with
people, then don't let your mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants start to get root bound,
they may try to auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that will trigger
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get root bound, you've got a
couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either up pot to a larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a one gallon pot,
put it in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you know how to up pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill the pot about halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull the pot off of the old dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably fucking real tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to squeeze that pot off,
turn it upside down and shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that pot off the dirt, set it right in
the new dirt and fill it up with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pat it into where it's kind of snug and
then feed it with good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just up potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I would recommend if you've got
a root bound plant and you're trying to up
[SPEAKER_00]: pot it, maybe crunch those roots up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're all bound up, just put your
fingers in there and just crunch them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and spread them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage them to spread and stop them
from growing into a ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're up, if they're root bound,
up pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can learn how to root prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am scared of root pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not something I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to root prune,
get yourself a pot that will air prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your other option, you can simply clone
off of your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a bunch of clones and as soon
as you have one of them rooted and into
[SPEAKER_00]: some soil, you can just either throw that
big mother plant away or you can flower
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a decent shape, if you haven't
fucked it up by taking so many clones off
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, a lot of times you guys,
your mother plants are going to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this ridiculous shape to them because
you've been taking so many clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the OG Kush plants grow like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what you do, they're going to
just start getting a weird shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to re mom them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no crime in taking a bunch of
clones, selecting your favorite clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: restarting that one as your new mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can take that old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut a bunch of clones off of it
and donate them to your friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you could just throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's in good shape, like I said,
you can flower that old mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I just cut them down and
throw them away because they're already a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonky shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth working out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get as many clones as you can and
then just cut it down and let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to say,
what about genetic drift?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think that genetic drift would be
a problem if you were taking care of your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I talked about keeping strong,
healthy, problem-free mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the mother plants are healthy and the
clones are done properly and everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: cared for, there will not be genetic
drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had my clone of Flow since 2007 or
2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same plant, but it's the same
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have regenerated that clone several
times because it's gotten too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine over eight years how big that
fucking clone has gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to re-clone it several times,
probably eight times, probably keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: probably twice a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably even 16 generations through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just posted a picture of Flow today and
she is still beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really worry about genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't worry about it in the commercial
industry because if it's done properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift has not been a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the commercial industry for
several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been through several facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran my clone, like I said,
for eight years and it's still beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift shouldn't be a problem if
things are done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel like that was a quick,
good, useful rundown on mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we covered all the things we
need to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about shaping your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about strong veg nutrients and a
little bit of Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about keeping the plants healthy
and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to go in and pick off the
bottom stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts getting funky because it's
not getting enough light, pick off that
[SPEAKER_00]: crap on the bottom, that little frilly
crap, the pubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and pick them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I call them the pubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the strongest lights on the
planet for your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to keep them growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the more light you give them,
the healthier they will be, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy they will be, whichever,
and also the more clones you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all about the size of your grow
and your requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully label all of your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more than one mother plant,
please carefully label that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to give out clones,
please carefully label those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, be honest about the pesticides that
you're using on your mother plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're making it through the entire
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get root-bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn to up-pot,
root-prune, or re-clone your mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do so, if you re-clone,
don't worry about genetic drift because
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff says, if you do it right,
that's not even anything to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening
