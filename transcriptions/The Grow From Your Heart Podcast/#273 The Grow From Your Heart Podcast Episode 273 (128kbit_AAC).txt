[SPEAKER_07]: Hey everyone, this is Daven Branny,
and you're listening to the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: When this baby hits 88 miles per hour,
you're gonna see some serious shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, what you gonna do now?
[SPEAKER_06]: What we gonna do right here is go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: How far you going back?
[SPEAKER_06]: Way back.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we go a little something like this,
hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Thursday, and that means it's time
for another Throwback Thursday episode of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the old episodes,
let me make a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I mention any advertising, any
giveaways, any promotions, or any
[SPEAKER_00]: contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no advertisements, promotions,
giveaways, or contests that are valid in
[SPEAKER_00]: these old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening,
and with no further ado, here's a block of
[SPEAKER_00]: old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 158 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 158 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for episode 158 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
It's time for episode 158 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about 200 milligrams deep on some
edibles right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been taking plenty of dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna bring you an amazing podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, in this episode,
we're gonna talk about an email that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: sent a friend of ours in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's at Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll verify that in the email.
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is awaiting and anticipating the
legalization of cannabis in his area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he wants to be properly prepared and
he wants to know how to get a jump on
[SPEAKER_00]: things, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also, he's got a legislation
question lined up for Mike, and then he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a grow question lined up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll probably take up most of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also going to read a Facebook post
from somebody in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also hope to get to an email,
you know, we'll start with that one
[SPEAKER_00]: because it'll be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to get to an email, a message that
we received from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get that far, hey Mike,
let everybody on that's listening,
[SPEAKER_00]: let everybody know how they can stalk you
on social media so that they can check you
[SPEAKER_00]: out while they're listening to your
handle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure you support Pueblo for Sensible
Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys he posts a lot of great stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us a like.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you see something you like,
give us a share.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us build the cannabis army.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got pumped when you said you had an
email that specifically requested you and
[SPEAKER_09]: me to answer some stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be an awesome question
for anybody who states moving forward with
[SPEAKER_09]: their marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_09]: They called you white Mike specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew I needed you for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: They know it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, you're going to want to listen
to this, especially if you're in Michigan,
[SPEAKER_09]: but also if your state's just looking to
go medical or even recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere that is getting ready or has
not yet, this could be informative.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of listeners I'm betting
that could use the information we're about
[SPEAKER_09]: to cover today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I want to talk about
the breeding project that I keep telling
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making, I've got an Arise mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been updated yet,
if you don't listen to the show regularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I'm iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's breeding cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm breeding cannabis plants.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, they're not goats or
children.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you haven't been listening,
let's catch you all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not breeding piranha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a strain that I made recently
tested at 31% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cross of golden goat and a
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tested at 31% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I searched through about a hundred seeds,
maybe more than a hundred to find the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really killer male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also got a few phenotypes of
females of the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all in a room together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male has been removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: His pollen did its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male has been pulled out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lemon skunk plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a golden goat plant in there for
experimental reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a grateful dog plant in
there because I wanted to make the Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: cross to grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my two flagship that I'm known
for right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of a lot of people's favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will not be any retail grateful dog
to Arise seeds for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a very small batch.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the beginning of the project
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise however, I just made F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise mail hit the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise females and I made F2 and by hitting
multiple phenotypes of the females,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made a nice option for selection
for variation for my F3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to see what that plant expresses
in a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be able to pick a very good male
and a very good female to make the F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually, my goal is to take this to
F5 and I'm trying not to rush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go through and find the exact
plants I need.
[SPEAKER_09]: The more time and the more plants is sort
of the better is the rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_09]: These projects, you know, my encouragement
is to go slow and as big as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection is key when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that if I hit multiple
females with one male and then I pull
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from and I keep them separate and
then I find that golden male, I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to use, say I've got the females are
labeled, actually what they actually are
[SPEAKER_00]: is there's number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The keepers, the ones that are going to
survive to another run are four,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, and one that was lettered E from a
previous run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three that are amazing
phenotypes of a rise.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are your ladies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will stick around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the i3, the iRE3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will stick around for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male I call him Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that I'll see diversity and I may
pick a male from number three or E and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I may pick a female from number four
and I may breed that way, which that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still the same phenyl generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still the same genetics, so I'm still
making F3s, but it gives me a little show,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of variation and a lot of... In the
next run, you're going to have a lot more
[SPEAKER_09]: options than you would have otherwise
because you're going as big as you are
[SPEAKER_09]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to narrow it down to where
it almost looks like clones when you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I get to F5, I want to be able
to say, yeah, it's going to look like this
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's basically a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I'm taking that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are... Listeners, if you're not quite
as nerdy as we are, the long and the short
[SPEAKER_09]: of what we're getting at here,
the goal of all of this is to find the
[SPEAKER_09]: best of the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically what that takes is a lot of
trial and error and a lot of willingness
[SPEAKER_09]: to kill off plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And towards the end or at the end,
the goal is you'll be able to put a 10
[SPEAKER_09]: pack of seeds in the ground and have all
of them come up very, very, very similar,
[SPEAKER_09]: very stable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what you're looking for for a
market ready product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not often what you get when
you're buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that that's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what is available and even a lot
of what I am making and what is available
[SPEAKER_00]: for myself are F1s, which means that they
have not been F2, which means they have
[SPEAKER_00]: not been standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a male of one strain and a female
of another, and I put pollen on it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tested them plenty before they were
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of seed companies that do
that, but that's what a lot of my stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guys like DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the market standard right there,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of, yeah, that's how Gage
Green Genetics does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of how Sunkill does it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always shake my head at a 10 pack that's
one of each strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, like how Greenhouse will sell you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I've seen it from a number of the
major companies where you'll get it in one
[SPEAKER_09]: form or another.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen it as 10 little plastic baggie
stapled together.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I get one seed of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just trial and error with
germination alone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes that silly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you know as much as we do about
like phenotypical expression and plant
[SPEAKER_09]: stabilization and that this is likely an
F1 or maybe if I'm lucky in F2,
[SPEAKER_09]: like God only knows what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I've only got one seed,
I'll make sure it work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I've seen people bank on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lemon skunk that I have, my lemon skunk
that I have came as a gift seed from
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else and I got one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a gift from somebody else and
they got it from Greenhouse seeds and they
[SPEAKER_00]: got one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've grown a few killer one-offs in my day
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one that I kept that I have is
what I have bred the Lemon Jeffrey and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cascade from.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of your first big breeding projects
had a plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can never remember if it was the
bubblegum or the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the best stuff I've smoked to this
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just the one-off that we
couldn't find again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I don't like the way stuff
grows or whatever, I just don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember it grew atrociously,
but the flavor of it was just,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, it was so up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the way it did its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't like the way a plant grows,
I'll just get rid of it because like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, I've got so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just run more seeds to replace
that and have the best of the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want something that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a 10, you don't want a
bunch of sevens around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding project I'm speaking of is
approximately 62-ish days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow will be the start of week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nine weeks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means it's just about done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken out three, I've taken out four
seeds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth seed looked completely ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm letting it ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tomorrow is Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully if I get all of my work done at
a reasonable hour by the end of Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go in there and start chopping down
plants of the new Arise F2 project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a small run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take me a lot of trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I'll do it is I'm going to cut
down one plant and then- These are the
[SPEAKER_09]: ones I saw a week ago, a few days ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll cut them down, take off all the
big leaves, hang them upside down,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them dry until they're fairly crispy,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just cut off a branch,
hold it over either a Tupperware dish or a
[SPEAKER_00]: pie plate and crumble it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like you're going to- They're pretty
crispy when you're harvesting seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you're going to roll up old
school weed and just crunch it up and let
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds fall out and then pull out the
seeds, pull out the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may roll some joints with the dried
material, but then a lot of it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get turned into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have some VHO coming up here in just
a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I'll set the seeds aside,
let them dry out real well, get them nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will put them into little
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get some packages from
lecontainers.com and then get those lined
[SPEAKER_00]: up, get a few of them into some packages
and get them out to my friends that test
[SPEAKER_00]: them out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will grow a shit ton of them
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will see if the Arise F2s are worth
growing, worth making more of,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if I selected the wrong male,
then I'll go back and find another boy of
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit and try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I've used multiple females,
I'll keep all the females separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the seeds separated, and I will run
comparisons of batch A, batch B,
[SPEAKER_00]: batch C, and I will see which ones I like
better so that I could find my breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a lot of research and a
lot of work and a lot of looking before I
[SPEAKER_00]: even continue, before I even think about
making an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to really see what the F- or before
I make an F3, I want to see what the F2s
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost time to take those down,
probably tomorrow night when I get done
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll let you guys know how they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll talk about that on the
show.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyone that's been- Yeah, I'm looking
forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't tell, I've been talking about
it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk about one more thing
before we get into some of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of- so let me go way far back.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a year and a half ago, we're coming
up on two years almost, a year and three
[SPEAKER_00]: quarters ago, I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit the fuck out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head on a low doorway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 6'5", the doorway was probably 6'3".
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking fast enough to where when I
hit the top of my head on this doorway,
[SPEAKER_00]: it knocked me clean the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking to some stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head, knocked myself out,
completely unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went spaghetti and fell down the stairs
while I was completely unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to have a couple of friends wake me
up, carry me up the stairs, get me in a
[SPEAKER_00]: chair, try to get my shit back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was broken, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some serious problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vision was not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain was not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My word association wasn't happening
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My names, I couldn't remember people's
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: My best friends would be sitting at the
table and I couldn't tell you what the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck their names were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having physical problems related to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body would not regulate its
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running around in just a t-shirt and
everyone's in coats and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at me like, do what kind
of drugs are you on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, head injury, no drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just fucking sweaty all the time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not stop being overheated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that was also funky was my
vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vision would get wobbly sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would watch certain animated shit or
certain TV shows filmed a certain way,
[SPEAKER_00]: my vision would get weird and I just have
to quit watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain video games would fuck with my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really play video games,
but if I watch other people play,
[SPEAKER_00]: some games would mess with my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's really messed with me for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having dizzy spells for a little
while, but everything's pretty much back
[SPEAKER_00]: to normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm back on track from all that
until I recorded that episode at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of weeks ago, if you guys
listened to the podcast, I went to Elevate
[SPEAKER_00]: and recorded a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a rig there by an artist named
Matt Cameron.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I call him Matt Cameron?
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw the social media post about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Cameron Reed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me correct myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Matt Cameron is a drummer that I
watched a video from the other day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the dude's name is Cameron Reed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cameron Reed Glass on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude made a rig and the work is
called redicello or ready work is what
[SPEAKER_00]: they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just clear glass with white lines
through it and it's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this rig and when I stared at the
rig, it started moving.
[SPEAKER_09]: It had a Christmas ornament glass quality
to it, if that helps describe it for the
[SPEAKER_09]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trippy to my brain, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my brain do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at it, it looks like it's
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those lines look like they're
spinning around like Tron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I stared at it, everybody looked at
me like I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, you got to quit looking at
that because you're the only one seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, okay, I'm going to walk away
from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I posted on Facebook basically my
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with this rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you guys, this rig is,
I looked at the price tag from underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: because the price tag is on the bottom and
the shelf it's sitting on is glass so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could see through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either $2,100 or $2,400.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't read if that was a one or a
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not in my budget to spend on a
glass rig to tell you the damn truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be awesome to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just stare at it and take dabs out
of it and then stare at it some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted up to Facebook and to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much told the same story,
hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes were fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I saw this rig and I was mesmerized
and then I'm in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a picture of the rig and the
artist that made the rig contacted me and
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me a sweet pendant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a disc pendant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bigger than a silver dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit bigger than a
silver dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some great ready work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an opal in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always forgot the name of the opals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an opal in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wore it on a chain to the secret sesh
the other night and everybody told me how
[SPEAKER_00]: dope my pendant was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys with blue eyes, all of my friends
with blue eyes and blonde hair or close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ginger side of life, all of them would
look at it and they would make the same
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking mesmerized face that I make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something with blue eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine, she does eye stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say the name of her career wrong,
but she does eye stuff and she's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I can teach you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, I don't want to learn
about my eyes because if you tell me what
[SPEAKER_00]: my eyes are doing, I'll start feeling it
and it'll fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you say eye stuff, are we talking
like American Medical Association
[SPEAKER_09]: certified ophthalmologist?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we talking like blow sage smoke?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: She wears scrubs and goes to an eye place
every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she's professional.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know both types of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eye stuff isn't real clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got friends that can fucking rub some
nog chomp on your face and tell you you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works with a very well-known doctor
here in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just double checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, she's professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's bad at what she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell she's good at it because she
comes home and you can tell that she's
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of what she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, good work.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that there's a style of art that
only mesmerizes gingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend knows why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or blondes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she can explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something with the rods and cones and
my blue eyes that do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cameron Reed Glass, dude, thank you for
the sweet pendant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was dope as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spins around just like that rig that
you made, bro, so it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hold it still in the palm of my hand,
it looks like it's fucking spinning and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope somebody tags you or tells you to
listen to this podcast somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to all my friends at
Elevate Glass because that's where I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys follow Cameron Reed
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes sweet glass and he's a cool ass
dude, so shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a cool fucking gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up the mailbox one day and find this
cool ass pendant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends loved it too at the secret
sesh and the dopest pendant at the sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the main topic of this
podcast now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of screenshots here
because I like to screenshot the messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it much easier for me to find
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a really quick message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I don't say the names,
but this dude, he's from North Carolina
[SPEAKER_00]: and his name is Carolina Cannabis,
so follow him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, what's something I can use for
food for plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides buying nutrients in a bottle,
growing outdoors in North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_00]: only a few weeks of flowering left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, buds are decently fat,
but I know she's probably hungry for
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get this episode out
to you as soon as we can because you need
[SPEAKER_00]: this information pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say only a few weeks left of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't do anything in a bottle,
so you're looking for like around the
[SPEAKER_09]: house style?
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the grower in me says- Where's
Jesse when we need him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is on the coast right now having a
good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Jesse's in Portland is where I
think he is, so shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag earned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you cut off his ponytail?
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks so handsome now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got himself cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike nailed what I thought most people
would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use some guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to use some alfalfa
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to use something like
that, but you've only got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to pump a whole bunch of
stuff into the plants, and most of those
[SPEAKER_00]: organic products are going to take at
least two weeks to four weeks to closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: six or eight weeks to even break down and
be available.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, it sounds like you
missed your shot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a few things- There's some good
news though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nature-wise, the plants supposed to have
used up most of what's around it by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that's as intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a couple of things that you
can do if you don't want to go buy
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got a few weeks left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that you're going to want
to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even outdoors, you need to flush your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a time period where they're not
receiving any nutrients so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: start to get rid of the shit that's stored
up in them so that your buds burn and
[SPEAKER_00]: taste and smell perfectly at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself hopefully 10 to 14,
maybe 15 to 16, maybe 20 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flush for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you haven't been feeding up to
this point either, you don't want to hit
[SPEAKER_09]: them with too much now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll shock the hell out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he knows they're probably hungry
for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he hasn't boosted them up,
they probably are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would recommend if you want to
feed them something, like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: some guanos would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff like that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some comfrey would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe make up a nice tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tea with some worm castings,
some alfalfa meal in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put a little tiny bit of molasses in
there just to keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then any sort of kelp meal or
something, make a tea out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just coming to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to go as smoothly as I can
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put some I'm not sure what all you
are willing to use either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kelp meal would definitely help you
get some bulk and some flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put some fish hydrosolates in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help you out with some
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make a tea like this,
brew it up for just a couple of few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need instructions on making a
tea, send me an email and we'll try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse on here to help us with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll answer you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send me this message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me a message on Instagram and
hopefully I can run you through making a
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed the plants the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't make a tea, then some basic
fish hydrosolates in a bottle would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some water into a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little more than what the label says
a fish hydrosolates in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some molasses in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe some kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of kelp product that you can put
in there, liquid kelp would be more
[SPEAKER_00]: available, but that's a bottled product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to do that, I think a
tea would be your best way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and I have done episodes about
making teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a thing that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to search for that,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll either find it for you or I will
reply to you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just doing the math in my head.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: If this show doesn't come out immediately,
he's only got three weeks from when we're
[SPEAKER_09]: recording it at most of grow time left.
[SPEAKER_09]: If he's on the East coast, if I've got my
numbers right in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our friends in Colorado are
actually harvesting this weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked to people higher up in elevation
than we are down here in Pueblo that are a
[SPEAKER_09]: little further up into the foothills.
[SPEAKER_09]: Harvest began last week.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're dipping below 50 at night.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just what's up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plants are done.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should see them.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually went to two different grows,
one that was about 700 feet higher up in
[SPEAKER_09]: elevation than the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to the higher one first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Buds were almost done.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were going to give them three more
days at harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I drove down the road a few hundred feet
and buds were three weeks from harvest.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit closer to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which side of the mountain?
[SPEAKER_09]: Our side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are we used to the Rockies?
[SPEAKER_00]: We both had to think about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because the mountains are west.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I had to quickly do the... So I
know which direction I'm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, how do you always know
where you're going?
[SPEAKER_00]: The mountains are right over there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been in Colorado more than a
year, you know how to get to wherever you
[SPEAKER_00]: go because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Mike was talking for a second,
I got a chance to write this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to make a tea, get yourself a
five gallon bucket, get a clean bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Lowe's, pay a couple bucks,
get a clean bucket, go to the hydro store
[SPEAKER_00]: or the fish store, get an air pump that
pumps out quite a bit of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself one of those air stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the air stone in the bucket to fill
the bucket with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, put the air stone in there and
get that air stone pumping that water with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of oxygen for 24 hours before you do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal here is to get the chlorine out
of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bubble that, get the chlorine out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, add some warm castings,
add some alfalfa sprouts, add some kelp
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And add a little tiny bit of molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that bubble for like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get foamy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect it to get foamy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It will foam up like a beer and go
everywhere if you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may or may not.
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on your witch's brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proteins in the fish hydrosolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write fish hydrosolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put fish hydrosolates in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proteins in the fish hydrosolates.
[SPEAKER_09]: I helped the guy shampoo the smell out of
his carpet one time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just fair warning listeners,
be careful what your witch's brew does the
[SPEAKER_09]: first time you make it because sometimes
it foams up like a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend, this will make
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use this five gallon bucket,
you could probably cut this in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're going outdoor, you just pour
the little five gallon bucket on there if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's getting toward the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take your five gallon bucket,
fill it with water, put the bubble in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble it long enough to get the chlorine
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you pour in the fish hydrosolates,
warm castings, alfalfa sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the right one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what I want to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp meal and molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour those things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more things that you could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use crab meal, you could use
bone meal, you could use fish meal if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are not all necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that shit stew around and that bubbles
for like 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a bunch of foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it in the garage if you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it somewhere where it's easy to clean
up, where you're not worried about a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does not foam up, that does not mean
it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it bubble up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go outside and pour it on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on the plants, near the root zone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water your plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go near the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out because your roots that eat the
most and drink the most are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are on the outer perimeter of the plant,
not right there at the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part of the stalk is always going to
have some moisture down there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on the outer edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where your growing roots are and
the plants are reaching out for stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your best bet is to make a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water with this tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hopefully you'll see a little bit of
boost in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish hydrosolates are going to give
you a little bit of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worm castings are going to give you
microbes and it's going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worm castings will provide a little
tiny bit of nitrogen, but they'll also
[SPEAKER_00]: speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alfalfa meal is going to give you
nitrogen that's readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kelp meal, I just think that that
makes everything stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it smell better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it taste better and it adds to
density.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I talk to organic growers,
one of the first things that comes up is
[SPEAKER_09]: kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ocean products are always going to
make your stuff taste better in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molasses will actually feed all of the
worm casting microbes and it will also
[SPEAKER_00]: feed your plants a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you can do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right at the end of your clock,
bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry we didn't get this question sooner
and out to you sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blaming anything on Jesse,
but man, Jesse was busy as shit this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we didn't do many outdoor episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse next year, you know, Jesse,
let's just sit down and record a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: season of outdoor shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get him once and do 11 episodes in one
long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hard to nail down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came by the other day and smoked me
down with some distillate that his
[SPEAKER_00]: company's making and it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time I saw him in person,
I asked him, how's this going?
[SPEAKER_09]: And he went on for like 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: 45 minutes about projects he's currently
working on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he's easily one of the three
busiest people I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend Carolina Cannabis
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out his beautiful cannabis growing
skills and photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to send me more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how your grow comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if I answered your question
in the way you needed to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else that has a message,
please send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be easiest if you initiate a
conversation by sending me an email to
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're already corresponding on another
social media platform, keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easiest just to keep one conversation
happening because if you jump to another
[SPEAKER_00]: platform, I'm going to fucking get
confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're new, go to
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to get in touch with
me and I'll get your questions on an
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get through the questions
quickly because I know some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions are urgent because you've got
plants growing and you need shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to get on it, trying to do
more episodes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got another thing I want to read
before I get to the basement and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to read a question that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw something on Facebook the other day
and I thought it was very entertaining
[SPEAKER_00]: right after I did an episode about trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a recent episode, we talked about trim
machines and I kind of bashed the shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said, which trim machine to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, don't buy a bunch of fucking
scissors and get your friends over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically what I told them because
that's really what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody on Facebook, I don't know if
he wants to be named or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's known as Sodapop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, upcoming croptober helpful hints
and we call it croptober.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, October is croptober in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs to get some shit trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, California, the whole coast,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen trimigrant memes recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a thing in lots of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimmigrants are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So helpful croptober or upcoming croptober
helpful hints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dude says, number one,
if you want to process your trim into
[SPEAKER_00]: quality meds, please do not use a machine
trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oils from machine and the beaten trim lead
to unsightly slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's saying that there's oils actually
in the trim machine, on the blades of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trim machine, on the metal parts of the
trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's got to be lubricated
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every auto trimmer I have ever used had
moving parts which require lubrication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those oils will end up on your trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that beaten up trim, like I said
before, it turns into basically mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that when the trim is cut into so many
pieces, when you cut it with scissors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut that leaf off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it most- But you're not making
like mulch.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not turning it into pet,
you're not lawn mowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this trim machine's hitting it and
just mulching all your little pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leaves that many spots for
moisture, that much surface area for
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and that many spots for
chlorophyll to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hit it with scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so then all that green comes in your
dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, like half juice is the product.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does juice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that juice ends up in your hash
and it tastes like shit and looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then number two, he says, if you plan
to process the nug, please flush correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: and no spraying or pesticides whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chemicals and nutrients tend to
leach into concentration and lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: unsightly slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's saying flush properly,
flush correctly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he's using unsightly and there's a
lot implied there, especially in a market
[SPEAKER_09]: like Colorado's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've sprayed your plants with just
about anything while they're in flower,
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's processed into a concentrate,
that concentrate's not going to pass
[SPEAKER_09]: testing and make it onto the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people he's talking about,
I think he's talking about these black
[SPEAKER_00]: market street growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, it's unsightly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because most of us in a warehouse
environment know this.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of this is going to make it onto a...
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make concentrates,
think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to spray some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is everybody using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Azimax is probably one of the most popular
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I worked in the dispensary area,
every... I've toured a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and all of them have azimax
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most common spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about something
that azimax is going to do in a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode that I've got written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone's got the azimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure... It's kind of waxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of oily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spray azimax onto your plants at like
probably, I don't know, week two,
[SPEAKER_00]: week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's in the middle of your buds as
your bud grows around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That waxy, oily concentration is still
there and the buds just grow around it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the buds dry and you grind it up and
you run it through an extraction machine
[SPEAKER_00]: and wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see that little layer of
azimax right on top of your concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it float to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have fucking tasted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in rooms that have... I've
sprayed... I didn't know any better when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember back in the day when we did not
know any better, we would spray whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck the dudes, the hydro... I've got
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you read five years later like
this causes immediate blindness if you
[SPEAKER_00]: touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh fuck, I used to spray
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sprayed these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've also smelled them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I did because now I can smell
them and taste them in other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Neem oil is a big one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something a lot of the organic or the
natural people like to use at one point or
[SPEAKER_09]: another.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you use that shit in flour... My
face puckered up a little when you said
[SPEAKER_00]: neem.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's everybody that consumes cannabis at
one point or another has hit a bowl and
[SPEAKER_09]: all they tasted for the next hour was
neem.
[SPEAKER_09]: They might not have known where it was,
but that's incredibly common.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just quit spraying shit that's in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man Joe environment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush correctly and don't spray
bullshit on your plants if you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a general rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use... If you're making
medicine or something you want other
[SPEAKER_00]: people to consume, flush properly and
don't spray shit on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, take proper care of nug and
trim that would be for use in extra
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts, proper cure, care, cleaning,
and basic hygiene of the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: material are critical for quality meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, one thing that I don't see
enough of is people wearing nitrile or
[SPEAKER_00]: rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want all your finger skin in my
concentrates or on my flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're trimming, that shit is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some gloves, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke your skin flakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to smoke your fucking hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, take care of stuff just because it's
going to get turned into hash doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you can trim your trim, your leaves into a
tarp on the floor and have the whole crew
[SPEAKER_00]: walk on them during trim time and then
sweep them up and make hash out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim that into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's somebody's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about... Look at it all as something
that you're going to put into your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're one of them dirty fucking
people that leaves you off the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it as something that a princess
has to put in their mouth because it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be clean products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, cure your shit just because you're
going to blast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was that weird thing at the
beginning of the butane hash days where
[SPEAKER_09]: you made BHO with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You couldn't use the stuff that was trash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember people saying some crazy shit
like, oh, if it's moldy, just blast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew doesn't exist anymore since
we have BHO.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you want to make good concentrates,
you really have to produce bud that's
[SPEAKER_09]: ready to go on a store shelf.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then make concentrates from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of that bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see so many people that fuck up that
last step.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like buying a Lamborghini and
wrecking it in the lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not even off the lot yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wreck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've spent nine weeks flowering and then
you just spend a week harvesting and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just going to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well throw it in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you flush that plant, you can cut it
down and knock off most of the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you plan on blasting the entire
plant, hang it up, let it... Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burping up some Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut it off the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the sticks out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've pretty much got blastable
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really fuck that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe some of the stuff
that I've seen and heard of coming in from
[SPEAKER_00]: like grows coming into extraction labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have found cigarette butts,
scissors, razor blades, forks from lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all kinds of shit in the material.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so bad two years ago when we
started implementing lab testing that a
[SPEAKER_09]: number of extract companies just went out
and bought the 100,000 or 200,000 to
[SPEAKER_09]: 300,000 piece of equipment so that they
could in-house lab test shit as it came
[SPEAKER_09]: in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because some of the stuff they were
processing was so nasty, it was fucking up
[SPEAKER_09]: their machines.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they processed the material for the
first guy in the morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: It dirties up the machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody else that gets run that day is
taking home a piece of that trash that
[SPEAKER_09]: came through in the morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little residual Asimax or whatever
on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now they're testing it all before
it goes into their machinery.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that none of that's possible anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about somebody, another farm
running some stuff and throwing some
[SPEAKER_00]: Asimax in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my farm running this clean
organic product in there and just mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got your Asimax residuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cringe when I see stuff like black
markets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stuff where they're like, just got some
awesome sap and you look at it and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: black and soupy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And God only knows what's in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're so lucky here that we've got
lab testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got some regulation that we can get
away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was more available to the
recreational grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab testing is not as available,
but in the future it will be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the things that I'm going to
hit coming up in this last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of perfect timing,
we're 36 minutes into this podcast and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have not gotten to the main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Soda Pop for the cool
Facebook post.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end he hashtagged that the machine
knows the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supports my claims that trim machines
suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your plants and take care of
the trim and nug if you plan to make
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys good luck out there this
croptober season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your plants made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope none of them got stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that if thieves did take your shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that time of year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We call it croptober.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also call it homie season.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stuff goes missing right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ripper season.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen some social media stuff already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if they took your shit, they're not
your homie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, right now it's getting close to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're growing outdoors in any way,
shape or form, it's smelling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably sleeping out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Half my friends are sleeping outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody that's been out there for six
months knows it's there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just take some deep breaths, relax.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your shit getting stolen is not the worst
thing that could happen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they did take your shit, I hope they
left part of it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they were a cool thief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you had four plants, I hope they
only took one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just unfortunate that we still have
to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody comes to steal the tomatoes in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they stealing cannabis when
cannabis is somebody's cancer medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shitty.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just worth so much in certain places.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like leaving your bank account in the
backyard at some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody that listens to this show would
steal any plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into this email that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email, this dude signed his name,
Dab Smiths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, Hey, what's up, Ross and
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge fan of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've said before, he said, I had a few
questions I thought could be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Michigan and we just passed three
bills pushing us into a seed to sale
[SPEAKER_00]: system based on Colorado system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quickly talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we have a seed to sale
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that is for sale recreational
or medically in the state of Colorado has
[SPEAKER_00]: been grown from seed or a clone underneath
a Colorado marijuana enforcement division
[SPEAKER_00]: camera inside of a Colorado marijuana
enforcement division regulated facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as an optional premises
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that happens in there,
every square fucking inch of this facility
[SPEAKER_00]: is on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it set up to where if you can be
in that building and there is a spot where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not on camera, you have to put
another camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can hide around this little
partition or behind this door,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want another camera in there so that
you cannot hide anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that happens in there is on
camera, which that's where the seed part
[SPEAKER_00]: starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow a seed, it's on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow a clone, it is on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is given an RFID tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call those a med tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to tag every single plant and put
it into a system known as metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they are tagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are accounted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are part of your plant count that
you're allowed to have.
[SPEAKER_09]: When a regular walks into a room,
they've got a tool that they can just hold
[SPEAKER_09]: up and press the button.
[SPEAKER_09]: It tells them exactly how many plants are
in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because of the RFID on those plant
tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is tracked down ridiculously in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as those plants grow, they are now
clones in my computer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put them into bigger pots,
now they have to be clicked into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I move them to another room,
they have to be marked in this little tab
[SPEAKER_00]: on the computer what room they move into.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I move them into flower, I have to
change their room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to change their status and I have
to mark that all the tags are still the
[SPEAKER_00]: same numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything stays on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's harvested, all of the trimmers
are in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is done on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trim is kept in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trash is weighed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the trash is weighed before it's
thrown away so that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything is weighed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut down the plant, put it on a scale,
hand it to the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They separate buds and sticks and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weigh the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weigh the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weigh the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We throw the trash away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trash is documented in the marijuana
enforcement division computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is known as metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is put into specific weight
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packages are documented in a computer
with a tag number on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tag again has an RFID code on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they are put into what's called a
manifest, a transfer manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that transfer manifest has the
vehicle operator's name, driver's license
[SPEAKER_00]: number, license plate number, vehicle make
model description, then you have to type
[SPEAKER_00]: in the exact route that you were
traveling, leaving this street,
[SPEAKER_00]: turning left on this street, right onto
this street to the destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you get there, it is unpacked
and checked on camera by the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's taken to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's put on a shelf all under camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is sold all under this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is recorded and covered and
there's absolutely no room for leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time that anything could happen
is in a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're following marijuana
enforcement division rules, every package
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaves the Grove facility is vacuum
sealed in a vacuum bag with a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement division sticker on it that
has a specific weight written on it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that is also on a paper that
matches that tag number that has the
[SPEAKER_09]: corresponding weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even tell you how many hundreds of
shipments in my day and not one of them
[SPEAKER_09]: was off by anything ever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can't, if they're in those
vacuum sealed bags and I open it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car while I'm driving, there's no way for
me to fucking seal that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is this razor knifed open?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only opportunity really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get caught if you do that
stupid shit.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Highly, highly, highly, highly regulated
is what we're getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the seat to sale system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Michigan is now, that was one of the
three bills they just passed is a seat to
[SPEAKER_09]: sale regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds stringent and it sounds
ridiculous, but when we have problems like
[SPEAKER_00]: we've recently talked about on the show,
there have been batches of concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been made with flowers that were
sprayed with pesticides that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed since each plant was tracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we apply a pesticide,
we write down every tag number that that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide is applied to or a foliar spray
or any type of soil treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can see that everything grown in
facility number 403 extracted by
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction company 402, and there's be
dashes at the end of those, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from that batch was contaminated at plant
tag number 1,6555 through 1,000 whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Releases a list.
[SPEAKER_09]: Retailers check the serial numbers on
their product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, instantly if you're carrying
some tainted product, cannabis or hash or
[SPEAKER_09]: edibles or topicals, you can follow all of
it from origin to retail and back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's absolutely helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it seems really, when you're
doing it, it seems obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, once it took me a couple of
months of working with, but after like a
[SPEAKER_00]: month or two of doing metric every single
day, I was like, oh, this is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes part of your routine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just treat your work day like chess
moves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as soon as you accept that you're good
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would make notes on a little piece
of paper of things that I needed to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: metric as I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would go to the office and just
catch up metric right before lunch and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go back and catch up metric right
before I leave at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when it got down to cutting clones and
doing things that needed a lot of metric
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little cart and I would just take
my MacBook to work and sign into metric
[SPEAKER_00]: right there and just do it on the cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was second nature by the time I was
done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seed to sale system is definitely
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the email
because this is going to be a long damn
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast if I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Michigan, we passed three bills
pushing us into a seed to sale system
[SPEAKER_00]: based on Colorado system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you and white Mike
could touch on the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do I go about finding out
information from the city about how many
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed facilities they will allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also says, what's the biggest
hurdle going from a basement grow to a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse, which I think is more directed
at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he continues to say, I know you have
recently made the switch from soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa and any advice on that transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am planning on running veg bloom and I'm
already in a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you add anything else to the line
as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things you didn't expect
going to such a large scale and any other
[SPEAKER_00]: advice you may think one would need to
know about taking a leap into the big
[SPEAKER_00]: league Thanks again for such a great
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can answer some questions for
me and other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, I'm not sure how you wanted to end
that, but yes, we'll answer your question,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Mike go with the first part
because I've got a lot of stuff to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, lawyer up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get into the cannabis
industry, lawyer up, get a lawyer and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get another lawyer to make sure that that
lawyer is not fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get a lawyer to keep an eye on
your accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get two lawyers and an accountant and make
sure they're all fucking keeping an eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first bit of advice.
[SPEAKER_09]: That should really be like the first half
of like every business school one-on-one
[SPEAKER_09]: class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're a lawyer and don't let
them be too good of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your lawyer and your accountant
don't seem like they like each other
[SPEAKER_00]: because then they can't team up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them embezzling from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep them watching each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's stealing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's stealing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep them like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike, the first question, how do we go
about finding out information from the
[SPEAKER_00]: city about how many licensed facilities
they will allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we hit record, I jumped online,
we jumped online and checked out some of
[SPEAKER_09]: the stuff about your law.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Michigan, local control is part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is from the cannabis,
surprise, surprise reported here in
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: But according to the cannabis,
the local control part in Michigan's law
[SPEAKER_09]: is growers, processors, shippers,
testing facilities and dispensaries could
[SPEAKER_09]: not obtain a state license unless their
local government adopts an authorizing
[SPEAKER_09]: ordinance.
[SPEAKER_09]: Municipalities could cap the number of
licenses within their borders and assess
[SPEAKER_09]: no more than a $5,000 fee per license.
[SPEAKER_09]: A state board would charge application and
renewal fees to cover costs, including for
[SPEAKER_09]: substance abuse programs and law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically what that means is you're
going to need two licenses to open any
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of marijuana business in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're talking about medical marijuana
businesses here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Recreational is not quite legal in
Michigan yet, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if your local area does not create some
sort of licensing process for these
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses, you can't get a state license
to operate in that area.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do you find out what those rules
are in your area?
[SPEAKER_09]: The first step is head to your local
planning and zoning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hop online, spend a few seconds with
Google, figure out where your planning and
[SPEAKER_09]: zoning department is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And while you're there, you're going to
want to look up city council or county
[SPEAKER_09]: commissioner, whichever sort of governing
body decides the land use rules for your
[SPEAKER_09]: area.
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, here in Pueblo, Colorado,
in the city, we have a city council who
[SPEAKER_09]: makes those decisions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in the county of Pueblo,
we have a board of county commissioners.
[SPEAKER_09]: These people are totally separate and have
totally different rules for marijuana
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses because they're totally
separate governmental entities.
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume it's very similar in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_09]: So first step is figure out which
municipality, city, county, whatever you
[SPEAKER_09]: want to have your marijuana businesses in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Head down to planning and zoning or city
council or whatever and ask is your first
[SPEAKER_09]: step.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because this is brand new,
you're likely to get to be met with a
[SPEAKER_09]: confused look, which means you've got some
work ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're lucky, the area you're in has
favorable government officials who saw
[SPEAKER_09]: this coming and have already crafted some
sort of land use code specifying which
[SPEAKER_09]: zoning designations the property for these
businesses have to carry, distances from
[SPEAKER_09]: schools, libraries, churches, those kinds
of rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they haven't gotten that far yet,
you're looking at a year or more of public
[SPEAKER_09]: hearings while these rules get hashed out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I said, you've got some work ahead
of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where I sort of got my activist
credentials in Pueblo was helping Pueblo
[SPEAKER_09]: do all of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you've checked with planning and
zoning to see A, if your area has these
[SPEAKER_09]: rules yet, and if not how they're being
created, the next thing to do is get
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself involved in that conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really easy to do, especially as
these rules are being crafted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever governmental agencies crafting
this rules will take a lot of public
[SPEAKER_09]: comment to get the community's input,
how far they want them from schools,
[SPEAKER_09]: how high the licensing fee should be,
if they want to add any sort of other
[SPEAKER_09]: rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, there's an area in Colorado
that requires marijuana businesses to be
[SPEAKER_09]: 100% energy neutral, which means they
can't consume electricity.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't also generate wrap your head
around that one in a county that doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: allow outdoor growing, but get involved
with these in this conversation now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way you can help nudge or guide
the regulators as they write the rules for
[SPEAKER_09]: your area.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're smart, you'll help them steer
clear of business number caps and things
[SPEAKER_09]: like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really, really, really bad for
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just creates monopolies, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It immediately creates a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It forces the local municipality to do a
bunch of obnoxious things like having a
[SPEAKER_09]: license lottery and some sort of review
process for applicants.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's additionally unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it creates a real legislative and
practical nightmare for the government
[SPEAKER_09]: agency trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet in Colorado, they continue to do
it all over and over again.
[SPEAKER_09]: But just get involved with this
conversation now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in all likelihood, you'll be able to
steer whatever local government agency
[SPEAKER_09]: that's writing these rules into crafting
smart rules for your agencies so that
[SPEAKER_09]: you're not looking at huge licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that they have a cap in the state
rules at five grand.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen it as high as 50 here in
counties and cities.
[SPEAKER_09]: The state only charges five or seven or
10, depending on the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on the size of your license.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've seen individual counties charge
much, much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to need a ton of money,
a lawyer, an accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you said planning and zoning and city
council, should he also join forces with
[SPEAKER_00]: his local marijuana activist groups?
[SPEAKER_09]: That depends on the climate in your area.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go down to planning and zoning and
are greeted by a really friendly person
[SPEAKER_09]: who hands you a printout of the rules
they've already crafted and all you have
[SPEAKER_09]: to do is fill out the application and find
a piece of property that's zoned
[SPEAKER_09]: appropriately and get a rental agreement,
well, congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: You live in a really enlightened area.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's likely to happen is you're
going to be met with a confused look and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're only going to just be creating
these rules now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if that's the case, your best bet
is to start attending county meetings,
[SPEAKER_09]: zoning meetings, just watching how those
meetings take place, getting a feel for
[SPEAKER_09]: the people in charge of those meetings
who's on your city council, who's on your
[SPEAKER_09]: board of county commissioners or your
zoning board.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they like and dislike?
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, it just takes a lot of sitting
and watching.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, watching laws get made is
incredibly boring.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're legalizing marijuana across
the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to write all those laws.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't want really, really messed up
laws written by people who don't
[SPEAKER_09]: understand what we're doing and what we're
working with, stand back and wait for
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody else to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some of the rules that were
proposed here in Colorado during this
[SPEAKER_09]: process were asinine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it took a while for people like myself
to explain to legislatures why it was
[SPEAKER_09]: asinine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because at face value, a lot of them
seemed like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you take it into practice,
like the last episode, we talked about
[SPEAKER_09]: Edibles labeling.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were ready to get rid of all drinks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just we'll get rid of them, period.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's never been a problem anywhere,
but we're going to cut out a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: section of the Edibles industry just for
no reason at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a lot of times they don't know
anything about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their background is in finance and they
were a dentist for 20 years or some shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know anything about mass
production of cannabis, retail rules,
[SPEAKER_09]: what those rules might be for alcohol and
tobacco retailers, why little tweaks to
[SPEAKER_09]: those rules are appropriate for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, getting them to understand all
that can be quite a bit of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably got some fear in them
also.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to go into this knowing that most
of the people you talk to were the hall
[SPEAKER_09]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to be a dick about it, but when you
start going to city government meetings,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're like, that's what happened to all
those people from high school.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just disappeared from my world after
graduation.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got jobs in city government.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where they all went.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeff went on tour.
[SPEAKER_09]: All these people got jobs at their local
zoning department and have worked their
[SPEAKER_09]: way through the ranks of city bureaucracy
for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the people you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not bad people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of them are wonderful, but they don't
really know anything about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know why we consume it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know why it's fun at concerts.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just know it gives them a headache
when they go see popular music.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really the extent of their
education.
[SPEAKER_09]: So getting them to understand that moving
all marijuana production indoors is
[SPEAKER_09]: incredibly bad for the environment,
especially when cannabis can be grown so
[SPEAKER_09]: effectively outdoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: That conversation, we failed at having a
lot of places in Colorado, which is why
[SPEAKER_09]: Pueblo County is so popular with
production facilities right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're loaded.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're one of the few places you can grow
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're one of the few places you can
grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're one of the few places where land
isn't ridiculously expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we've got the trifecta down here,
and that's why we have so many companies
[SPEAKER_09]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's changing the whole landscape
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that there's some money here
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any money here before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell that there's actually
some future for this place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Had our county commissioners followed suit
with Denver and Aurora and Boulder and
[SPEAKER_09]: Longmont and Lakewood and banned outdoor
growing, banned greenhouse growing,
[SPEAKER_09]: pushed it all indoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: The economic recovery we have enjoyed
would have been very different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so in Michigan, I know you guys have
been taking economic hit after economic
[SPEAKER_09]: hit for the last, my whole life,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: This can really be an economic engine for
growth and prosperity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not a tidal wave of money that's
gonna fix everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched the video on Detroit not too
long ago where people were disassembling
[SPEAKER_09]: skyscrapers and selling parts of scrap.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean- Like active skyscrapers or old
skyscrapers?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like old ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as there's still people in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount of recession in Detroit is
significantly different than what we see
[SPEAKER_09]: here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though we've got Pueblo and Detroit
have gone through similar things,
[SPEAKER_09]: the scale is very different.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a state like Michigan, marijuana really
could be two or three or 20 or 30,000
[SPEAKER_09]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could bring it back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now these people aren't all gonna be
making 75,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them are gonna be making 10,
50 an hour, 12, 50 an hour, 14 an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's still thousands of jobs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're still talking about hundreds of
million hundreds of dollars into improving
[SPEAKER_09]: properties and bringing them up to code.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when Jeff starts talking about is what
do you need to know going from greenhouse
[SPEAKER_09]: to warehouse?
[SPEAKER_09]: The improvements that are required in a
lot of the warehouses to get them up to
[SPEAKER_09]: where he's gonna get at, that costs a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that improvement is massive for the
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to upgrade our airflow system a
little bit at Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was getting some estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to connect two rooms,
two sides of a building and just run it
[SPEAKER_00]: through one air conditioning thing and
handle some humidity and some air control
[SPEAKER_00]: through one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes, oh yeah, probably six to
8,000 each side to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just for a small air exchange setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just it's going from the home to the
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he said 8,000 each side, I was like,
oh, this is gonna take a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: The economic boom a state can feel if this
is done correctly, if it's done smartly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to have it done correctly really takes
people willing to do the legwork,
[SPEAKER_09]: to go to city council meetings,
to go to state legislature meetings and
[SPEAKER_09]: make sure that they don't do thousand foot
from everywhere rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember here in Pueblo, the first
proposal I saw for buffer zones,
[SPEAKER_09]: the distance your marijuana business has
to be from other stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were like 25 different businesses on
there, like nursing homes, all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a specific business name because
they specifically seek out adults with
[SPEAKER_09]: developmental disabilities as employees.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that company's kind of niche is
giving that whole segment of the
[SPEAKER_09]: population a great job.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our original legislation had a
thousand feet from their property.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in the middle of all of this,
Colorado redefined what a thousand feet
[SPEAKER_09]: from a school meant.
[SPEAKER_09]: They changed how it's measured halfway
through the game.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wasn't like feet to inches kind of
distance, but it was what they call as the
[SPEAKER_09]: crow flies versus walking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so originally dispensing owners walked
out their front door and took the street
[SPEAKER_09]: on foot version to the nearest school.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then applied that way saying that they
were a thousand three hundred feet from a
[SPEAKER_09]: school.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they changed the rule to ask the
crow flies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it turns out the nearest pieces of
their property lines are only six hundred
[SPEAKER_09]: feet apart because of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was literally the only mass
shutdown of businesses in Colorado is
[SPEAKER_09]: because that rule changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, I mean, for you, when Jeff first
told me this was a question, I was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: dude, that's a whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't do that as part of a thing
because
[SPEAKER_09]: we can't do that as part of a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that as part of a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately for you, this wasn't as
bad when Colorado was doing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: The anti-pop movement is very vocal now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just the DEA and the police and law
enforcement in the prisons and police
[SPEAKER_09]: unions when Colorado was doing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now there are parents groups who are
freaked out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you get into this, mainly you'll
find that the anti-pop groups are just
[SPEAKER_09]: people who didn't have anything in their
world and needed something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And trying to remind us all that in eighth
grade we learned that pot is bad has
[SPEAKER_09]: become their goal in life.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not very good at research or
arguments.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just got a mailer or a flyer in the
mail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're dealing with a nasty one of
these down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the one thing they they really,
really are is vocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you do get involved in this
process in your area, one of the first
[SPEAKER_09]: things you're going to realize is that the
old dude who shows up to every meeting and
[SPEAKER_09]: won't shut up about whatever their topic
is, everybody that's involved in city
[SPEAKER_09]: government knows that asshole's topic
intimately.
[SPEAKER_09]: They know every in and out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're sick of hearing about it for
one reason, because that dude shows up and
[SPEAKER_09]: makes a lot of noise.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what the anti-pop people do.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll rally 35 or 40 church moms.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll show up in force to two or three
hearings.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of a sudden your city doesn't get
to enjoy any of the economic benefits of
[SPEAKER_09]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every marijuana consumer in that
geographic area that wants to participate
[SPEAKER_09]: in the legal market has to drive to the
next county to do so because of who showed
[SPEAKER_09]: up at a meeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You really, really, really need to start
taking a look at this, especially if you
[SPEAKER_09]: want to be part of the industry as an
owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got a chance to get in on the
ground floor right now, if you're willing
[SPEAKER_09]: to put in serious legislative legwork.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my half of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just glanced over a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, we're in an hour and two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost tempted to make this a two-part
question and cut this dude off now and
[SPEAKER_00]: make another episode out of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your half of the question is huge because
there's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we can give them the glance over
if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think we would, there's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he asked like four questions in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to make this a
two-parter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you down to record a little bit more
with me?
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally am.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I could use like a two minute break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you needed a stretch break,
a cigarette break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could use a fresh drink and a couple of
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, this podcast has
gone just over an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather record two episodes out of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike and I are going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have more questions- I'll do this
for you listeners, because we kind of do
[SPEAKER_09]: this on the fly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I twist your arm and make this a
Thursday episode or a Wednesday episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is going to be a Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way they're close together.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, this is more than interesting
enough to do a week teaser.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think our listeners are that
dedicated, but I want to hook them up and
[SPEAKER_09]: do it closer if we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying, a lot of times I try to
do two episodes a week, but I can't commit
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't dedicate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't made the promise.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have trouble getting one of these
together a month now just because we're
[SPEAKER_09]: both busy adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to make sure that these
two episodes come out on a Monday and a
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday, back to back quick like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you like this content that
comes from listeners and listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: generated material, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow Mike on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all we're going to do for
this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's sneaking away to go use the men's
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to grab a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take some dabs and then we're
going to record another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, until next time,
take a fat dab and give your mama a hug
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to send a huge thank you shout out
to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me use their music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout to Kat and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of
the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said last week's episode,
but it'll still be this week because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put these out back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't make you wait too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple, maybe three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is back sitting across the table from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just stepped outside for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike had a couple of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping it quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually 158.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call it 159 to keep the
feed going.
[SPEAKER_00]: 158.5 part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's getting a little bit chilly out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I just hung outside while Mike
had a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting a little bit crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a hoodie while I was out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you outdoor growers, your shit's going
to get purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that time of year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's going to be carrying a jacket
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends that are sleeping outside,
they're outdoor grow, I feel for you right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as comfortable as it was last
week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the heavy bag out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to start a campfire
or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got your dog out there keeping
you warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: No campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: No campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light.
Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that light?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the right kind of light?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right kind of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, hopefully you're warm outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're listening to this while
you're trimming down your outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about croptober.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's depending on where you're living.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're coming down now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what strain you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some flow or some blueberry,
it might be time.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're not coming down while you're
listening to this, you better be flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flushing for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put this train wreck of a podcast
back on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really two minutes and 30 seconds in
and we're already rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of
an episode that we did a few... Actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: we recorded it like an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard it a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an email and it started off with
questions for Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a part two that had
questions about going from a basement grow
[SPEAKER_00]: into a large facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me catch you up on the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read it all the way from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, what's up, Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge fan of the podcast, as I've said
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few questions I thought could be a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Michigan and we just passed three
bills pushing us into a seed to sale
[SPEAKER_00]: system based on Colorado system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you and white Mike
could touch on the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do I go about finding out
information from the city about how many
[SPEAKER_00]: license facilities they will allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: That part we handled on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you listened to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, press pause, go back, listen to
number 158 and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then come back and see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second part of the question,
what we're going to address today,
[SPEAKER_00]: he says, What is the biggest hurdle going
from a basement grow to a warehouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've recently made the switch
from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice on that transition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, I'm planning on using
veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already in the basement, but do you
add anything else to their line as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things you didn't expect
going to a large scale and any other
[SPEAKER_00]: advice you think one would need to know
about taking the leap into the big
[SPEAKER_00]: leagues?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, thanks for such a great
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can answer some questions for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already answered half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the second half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part where I need to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, thanks for doing such a great
job with the first half of this dude's
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really fucking nailed it for him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need further elaboration on any
point, hit me up on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love hearing from all of you,
from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love listener generated content.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an amazing question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had to do a two-part episode to
answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me your emails, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into the question.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I didn't say last episode, thanks again
for the killer question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get two hours worth of
content out of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the biggest hurdle going from a
basement grow to a warehouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to think about
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest things that I noticed
was different was the airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large building, the air doesn't flow
like it does in a small room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the air out in a small
bedroom in a matter of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a small blower, a large room,
you're going to have hot spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have cool spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find humid spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to learn how to
control that temperature and that humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: all throughout a large room.
[SPEAKER_09]: The scale of the increase is where many
legal retailers and production facilities
[SPEAKER_09]: are still problems shooting their
multimillion dollar grows because the
[SPEAKER_09]: difference in scope from a basement grow
or a smaller grow to a huge warehouse is
[SPEAKER_09]: monumental.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good, reliable HVAC company in Colorado
that will come work on a grow and knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing will make you wait
three months just to come give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate because they are so backed up
with cannabis grows right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I had enough money to do anything I
wanted cannabis business-wise,
[SPEAKER_09]: I would build from the ground up because
I've seen what so many companies have had
[SPEAKER_09]: to go through attempting to improve an
existing structure to where it's not
[SPEAKER_09]: giving them problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know so many people that they thought
they had everything under control and then
[SPEAKER_09]: as the season started to change,
the temperature change in that wall was
[SPEAKER_09]: causing major problems in a grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a unique problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: That happened to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your one wall, whichever side gets the
most sun or the least sun, it just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the seasons change in Colorado,
you'll usually see in a grow that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: never been in before, you have to find out
where the powdery mildew is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen when the first winter comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to find out where it's going
to happen because it probably will.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't designed your room
flawlessly on one wall, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get powdery mildew there when the
seasons change.
[SPEAKER_09]: You and I can problem shoot a basement
grow or a bedroom grow in 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_09]: an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_09]: By troubleshoot, I mean find the problems
and suggest easy ways to fix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk into a basement grow and point
out 10 things in 10 seconds that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your grow and make it more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a warehouse grow, part of it's just
putting in the time to get through the
[SPEAKER_09]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get enough heating and cooling,
a lot of people don't aim for enough
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think they're going to need
enough cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they put plenty of cooling or they
don't think about enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to evacuate humidity out of
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know outfits that spent more on AC units
than they did on building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that place.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not one outfit in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that's true for a half dozen or
more.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just happen to know the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The airflow is going to be a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're going to be feeding on a much
larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to build a drip system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be watering by hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you run that drip system,
you're creating more humidity in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you water by hand, there's
going to be more humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a drain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I would definitely look
for if you're moving into a new building,
[SPEAKER_00]: a floor drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treating water is a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treating water, if you're moving into a
warehouse, at the green and healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse, we used about a thousand
gallons of water every other day-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to treat that
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a really nice reverse
osmosis machine because something I
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed was we were using the water that
came from the municipality.
[SPEAKER_09]: The scale is what we're getting at here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're talking about a basement grow,
you're talking about one employee.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about a thousand dollars
worth of equipment.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little warehouse, you multiply those
numbers by a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back into this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using the municipal water from
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the temperature would change,
the smell of the water would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could smell chlorine in it on some days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could smell other things on some days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a simple pH test.
[SPEAKER_00]: On some days, the pH would be seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days, it would be nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be days apart from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would do PPM tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, it'd be really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, it would be really,
really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're feeding cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hard to predict what water
you're going to get tomorrow or the next
[SPEAKER_00]: day or the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: An RO machine would really be really
helpful in a large grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I would highly recommend
because you're going to need clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have more RO water than you think you're
going to need available because if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: too much heat, something goes on.
You're going to need extra water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's anywhere in the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guaranteed there's stuff in your municipal
water that you do not want to feed to your
[SPEAKER_09]: plants through your watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a problem, like bugs or powdery
mildew, you're going to have a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: problem than you have ever thought of
having because hopefully, you're running a
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a large system and you're going
to have plants that are in full flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of flower, and you can't treat
those for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be highly prepared for pests and pathogens
and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be on the lookout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring anybody into that grow unless
it is absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get clones from somewhere,
but when clones come in, quarantine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're treating them so hard for pests and
mold because you don't want to bring any
[SPEAKER_00]: of that stuff in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of facilities that they've
given up trying to treat clones and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're seed only now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a few outfits that have just given
up entirely, and I know a lot of home
[SPEAKER_09]: growers that that's been their policy
since the last time they got a gift clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scheduling and getting everything on track
in a big grow is a challenge in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning unless you're a guy like myself
that is OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to get a good
schedule happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to get veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need clones,
and you're going to need to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that these flowering plants are going to
be done in this amount of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I need this many veg plants to replace
them immediately because you do not want
[SPEAKER_00]: downtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to segue me into something
that I can really rant about personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hugest caveat of going from the
basement to a warehouse grow is often the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between the money person and
the actual grower, or oftentimes there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: middle man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have an investor,
you're going to have an owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to have a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which position you're
planning on taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please get all of those people on the same
page because I see a lot of grows fail
[SPEAKER_00]: because an investor throws down money and
he wants money back in 60 days because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing weed, where's my money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got an owner that's rubbing
his balls to keep him off you for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while, and he's like, give me 120 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the owner will say, how long do you
need to grow this crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the crops that I'm trying to
grow take me, I'm going to say 150 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need 150 days to make this crop happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner of that facility is going to
look you dead in the face and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, I'll see you in 120 days and it
should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're saying to yourself,
these are fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't cut 30 days off of this cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an investor bitching in an
owner, an owner yelling at a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower that wants to do the absolute
best he can for these plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where the passion is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the owner's got to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to return the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got an investor that only
cares about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hardest part of a commercial grow
is getting all of your people on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need your owner, your investor,
your master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need whoever else you've got in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got somebody working the bedroom
and the flower room, those two people need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a meeting every couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an trim crew, your master
grower and your assistant grower and your
[SPEAKER_00]: trim crew leader all need to communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know what plants are coming
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know how long you have to trim
this until there's more plants so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can schedule for the trimmers to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the things that you may
overlook.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so the scale and the scope are
so much more complicated than a basement
[SPEAKER_09]: grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, with a basement grow, you're
getting ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: You check out your plants every couple of
days for a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they get to where you want them,
you just start harvesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you call a buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you make a little plant and have two
friends coming over.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're talking about an industrial
scale, you're talking about like 15 or 20
[SPEAKER_09]: people that need to be scheduled,
paid, W2, trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe two or three people could run...
One or two people can run a hundred light
[SPEAKER_00]: grows efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two or three people... Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes time to trim,
then you need a small trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need five or six people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you need that trim crew
manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that assistant grower now becomes
also the trim crew manager, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need somebody that can delegate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a director that can direct the
facility, that can direct the employees,
[SPEAKER_00]: that knows about the plants, that knows
about people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need, like I said in the last
episode, a lawyer and an accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some things that you're
definitely going to need in a larger grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that you didn't think as much about in the
other grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shit goes wrong every day in a
larger grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large scale grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of times investors don't necessarily
know any of that, which is where a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: headaches and a lot of partnerships break
up is the money man doesn't know anything
[SPEAKER_09]: about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: They doesn't realize that something so
simple is when we were doing trimmer
[SPEAKER_09]: interviews, we walked like a dude through
the grow and we think he gave us drips.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why this crop is a third smaller
than it should be.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's stuff that comes up because you're
dealing with plant growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're dealing with a live plant in a
medium where mistakes can mean millions in
[SPEAKER_09]: lost revenue or delays.
[SPEAKER_09]: We really can't get it out enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: The scope is so much different.
[SPEAKER_09]: The attitude and the skill sets are
different.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the biggest traits for a basement
grower is secrecy.
[SPEAKER_09]: The ability to hide and stay hidden.
[SPEAKER_09]: That keeps people with shotguns away from
your door, whether they be law enforcement
[SPEAKER_09]: or rippers.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the biggest skill sets you
can have as a basement grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: As a legal marijuana business owner,
you need to be very out front,
[SPEAKER_09]: loud and proud about what you do,
how you do it, and the fact that you love
[SPEAKER_09]: to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love to follow the rules and I make sure
all of my employees love to follow the
[SPEAKER_09]: rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to become your mantra and you
need to get used to saying it in front of
[SPEAKER_09]: TV cameras, especially if you want to be
one of the first marijuana business owners
[SPEAKER_00]: in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we have somebody that's known
as a compliance officer and his only job
[SPEAKER_00]: is to make sure that you're following all
of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the MED, the Marijuana
Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets emails from them every day saying
that you know that this is a new rule,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a new rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his job to go, whether it's the
retail or the grow or the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, it's his job to get the
employees together and say, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has to oversee that that happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rule changes like that are frequent here
in Colorado and until nationwide,
[SPEAKER_09]: we really get legalization handed out or
hammered out.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be common in your area too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, I'm sure that we did an
entire episode on going from a basement
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to a large scale grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that we did an entire
episode on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave that in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a link to that in the show
notes or if you go to the website,
[SPEAKER_00]: iregeneticscolorado.com and scroll through
the shows, I'm sure you'll be able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot recall the episode number right
now and I do not want to scroll through
[SPEAKER_00]: old episodes while we're recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole episode about moving from a
basement grower to a large scale grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we haven't really
hit that you have available now that
[SPEAKER_09]: wasn't available to us when we started
this is you can come to Colorado now and
[SPEAKER_09]: hire a consultant or go visit a couple of
legal businesses and see how they do it
[SPEAKER_09]: and get an idea of what's going to be
required of you and where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a number of people out here in
Colorado have been hired to travel out to
[SPEAKER_09]: other states and help people navigate some
of the things like planning out warehouse
[SPEAKER_09]: grows.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the logistics that go into these
things will blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount of cooling that's required for
a one-story warehouse grow is typically
[SPEAKER_09]: greater than a 30-story office building.
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount of equipment that's necessary
is just insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Learning how to maintain all of that
equipment.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about pot growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want to grow pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount of information that needs to be
learned and adapted to is monumental.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I quickly learned is
I'm not just a pot grower anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to build drip systems with
PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to work on pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to work on air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to work on dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know how to work on the security
camera system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know how to build shit that I never
thought I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all because I went and helped
with a giant commercial facility and I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned a ton of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need such a varied skill set because
little things that don't have anything to
[SPEAKER_09]: do with growing marijuana can affect your
legal ability to do so.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you see a camera down in the grow and
you ignore it, you might get hit with a
[SPEAKER_09]: compliance violation because that camera
was down for an extra half day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your business shut down.
Quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got more parts of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to harp on the one part for
too long because the last episode got long
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just say harp on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez, how old am I getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said, I know you've recently made
the switch from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice on that transition?
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I'm planning on running Veg
Bloom and I'm already in a basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do you add anything else to the Veg
Bloom line as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a multi-part question
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice on that transition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use an easy cloner and I take my clones
from the easy cloner and I put them into
[SPEAKER_00]: solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solo cups have got holes in the bottom
of them so that they can drain plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: water and the water doesn't get stuck in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually fill the cups with an aerated
soil, something like Fox Farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: either Ocean Forest or the happy frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put the clones into there and
then I water them with my desired nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did so this time, but I used cocoa
instead of the aerated soil and 50% of my
[SPEAKER_00]: clones died.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking hated going into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa seems to have compressed and
smothered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not get a chance to get their
legs and they got crushed and killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought on that is put your clones
into soil if that's what you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: because they did not like the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into cups of dirt, put those cups of
dirt into the cocoa in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've learned because my plants
were really, really pissed off.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go dirt clones to cocoa plants
easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, they're just driving right in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't mind the transition once those
roots strengthen up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the weight of the water in that cocoa
compressed the cocoa real tight on these
[SPEAKER_00]: new roots and they just got crushed in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can water a whole heck of a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed more frequently is what I
think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't water a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed a heck of a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was running soil, I would feed
maybe twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, every time I am watering the plants,
they are getting nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three, maybe four times a week,
these plants are getting nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't show any signs of burn and they
are growing vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the cocoa not holding your nuts as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa, it doesn't hold on at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients just slide right out of
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you don't get as much burn and you
can feed more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll eat what it wants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Better for your plants, but not your
wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe in the end it'll pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking if it's going to eat that
much, there's going to be that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: weight that'll make up for it,
which isn't a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to do some math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'm thinking, I don't know if
I'm convinced on a hundred percent cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may start doing a 50% soil-less mix,
like a honestly not an expensive soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like roots organic or maybe even
tupper or the Fox farm ocean forest
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't hurt my feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 50% mix with the soil-less mix and
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the cocoa in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a couple of people that started
doing that a while ago and they all seem
[SPEAKER_09]: to rave about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I'm going to try that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next I'm going to run, I'll run one light
with the cocoa, one light with the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and then one light with the cocoa soil mix
and we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I feel about the soil
to cocoa switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I've noticed if I over water,
they take really long to dry out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will kind of slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that I could, yeah, I thought I
could water the shit out of them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa, but I've noticed that I want some
aeration in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I over water them, they really start to
get stagnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants really like that aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that right when they start to
dry out is when they really take off with
[SPEAKER_00]: the most explosive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting kind of dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've only ever seen one good aeroponic
system in motion and I was blown away with
[SPEAKER_09]: this dude's timelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part of his question,
he said, I'm planning on running Veg
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, do you add anything else
to their line as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I've got a screenshot here of a
conversation I had with a rep from Veg
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, this is what we are
recommended to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said four to five grams of base
nutrient per gallon in veg, five grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the HD or the RO or the
dirty, whichever one they selected for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you had a consultation with them
and had your water checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get your water tested, send them
water test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will recommend a base nutrient for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But four to five grams of base per veg or
per gallon in veg, five grams per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: in your flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, a half of gram per gallon of
plus life once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their rooting inoculate,
the plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a gram per gallon of plus life once a
week through veg and flour, and then taper
[SPEAKER_00]: that off in late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like around week four or five,
you can start pulling that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, shine starting in week
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the beginning of week three,
add shine, put one gram, a one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: grams per gallon of water is what he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shine starting in week three,
one gram to two grams per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of increase that a
little bit as time goes on from what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week three, do a gram to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week four, increase it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week five, increase it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six and seven, increase it a little bit,
and then start flushing from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, push foliar feed every
five to six days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I would cut out the push foliar
feed, maybe spray it one time at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of week five, and then pull off
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, the push foliar to spray 50
milliliters per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you've got a small crop,
just mix up a half gallon and put 25 mils
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that pHing that water before
you spray it may help you, but be careful
[SPEAKER_00]: what you use to pH, because you don't want
to go killing off the live... There's
[SPEAKER_00]: sisilic acid, there's calcium,
and there's secant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful what you're using to adjust
the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you asked if I add anything to that
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I put a little bit of osin-28 in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to add some potassium silicates to
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that gives the plants more vigor
and makes them a little bit more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once about every once a week,
once every 10 days-ish, I'll hit them with
[SPEAKER_00]: either hybrids or carboload, just to speed
up some carbohydrates in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: put a little bit of a boost in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I add to the veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too expensive that way,
and it is highly efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll put some shine on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make them beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I add to the veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also said you're already there in a
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things you didn't expect
going into such a large scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expected to put out a specific
amount of cannabis in a specific amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and I didn't know that there would
be obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect that there would be a
problem every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk into a large commercial
grow, when I would train new people,
[SPEAKER_00]: we trained a few new guys, and they said,
so what's the first thing we do when we
[SPEAKER_00]: get in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everyone's excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we got to do is find what
fucked up last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, there's so many moving
parts that something in here just broke.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's funny how- And that's the size
and scope thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was hitting that earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: In any grow, you need to keep an eye on
the moving parts, your timer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your numbers, your plugs, your pumps,
your hoses, connections, all of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bigger you grow, the more those
equipment checks eat up into your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're talking about a hundred light
or a 500 light massive warehouse,
[SPEAKER_09]: checking to make sure none of your drip
system plugs have come loose and are
[SPEAKER_09]: spraying water towards your ballast wall.
[SPEAKER_09]: That takes half a day sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent, honestly, the first half of my
shift when I would walk into the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first hour would just be making sure
that none of the cloners are clogged,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the sprinkler system is clogged,
none of the pumps are clogged,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the breakers have flipped,
all of the fans are on, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifiers are running and none of the
filters were clogged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would seriously spend an hour checking
all of that equipment just like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a text message back from a buddy of
mine maybe a month ago that read,
[SPEAKER_09]: can't talk, half the lights didn't come on
this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just that two sentence way to
let me know he can't talk right now and
[SPEAKER_09]: he's going to be busy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Until he figures this shit out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got a half million dollars and the
fire's getting closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really neat in our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run multimillion dollar grow facilities
that are responsible for, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: bragging, on Facebook, the owner of the
facility I was growing for posted one time
[SPEAKER_00]: that I pulled 320 something and a fraction
pounds of cannabis from 85 lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is three point something pounds per
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember where the hell I was
headed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that much product being grown,
300 and something pounds at somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 18 and $2,200 a pound,
approximately $2,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 300 of them times $2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produced that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we rely on like 10 and $12 timers that
could fuck everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it really funny that we've got like
this $8 timer from Lowe's that makes all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this get fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that one timer fucks up, the whole
facility does not get water for a day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in a basement, your timer screws up.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't notice it for three days.
[SPEAKER_09]: One grower's out, you know, 6,000,
8,000, depending on how bad the problem
[SPEAKER_09]: got before it got found.
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing happens in an industrial grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone's out several million and
everybody getting fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole dispensary that now has to
go buy retail weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, and take this a step further.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's 300 or 65 days in a year and a
shitload of them are fucking holidays.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to be with your home,
with your family.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody's got to be at the grow every day
to make sure all your lights went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started at Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pumps are spraying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm no longer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if everybody listens to every
episode, but I no longer work at Green and
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not involved in a large scale
production facility at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pursuing my own endeavors right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was at Green and Healthy
Wellness, for the first crop, I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: take a day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first harvest was, we were in
flower for nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon G went for 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a little bit of veg
time before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not take a day off for 79 or 84-ish
days because somebody had to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I did not expect,
but I was willing to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't be even tangentially involved
with the legal industry before the lazy
[SPEAKER_09]: stoner stereotype.
[SPEAKER_09]: The legal industry in Colorado,
we did a billion in sales last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do like 1.2 this year,
maybe more.
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount of days, like 12, 15 hour days
that people around the state put in to
[SPEAKER_09]: make that true is just astronomical.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I spend a billion dollars in my
lifetime?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to buy a country and people are
running.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could do it in like six hours on hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could do it in four minutes on drum
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I come to that party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the drum kit I'd build.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I can't decide which color,
but just buy them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get one of every, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you make that step from gray
market or the basement up into the legal
[SPEAKER_09]: industry, everything changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: In ways that you can't predict or imagine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you guys literally listen to this
so lucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know this going in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We learned this shit the hard way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I got to jump in and talk about
an ad, something I did not expect that was
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming, harvesting, drying,
and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need space for however much bud you've
got growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that much room for hanging buds,
basically, because you can't just crush it
[SPEAKER_00]: all together because it's going to get
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a climate controlled room for
drying and curing that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I totally did not plan
properly for when I was at Green and
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen people try to put a football
field size grow room into a bathroom size
[SPEAKER_09]: drying area and it's like, you're not
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air is going to get stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the humidity is stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need somewhere for the freshly cut
buds to be, for the older buds to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a drying and curing hanging
trimming system that is sufficient for
[SPEAKER_00]: your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you work on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're doing any size grow,
the best thing you can do to ensure
[SPEAKER_09]: success is to plan upfront.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're talking about the size and
scope in the legal industry, that's
[SPEAKER_09]: astronomically important.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen little oversights lead to
multi-million dollar fuck ups and
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses collapsing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just silly, stupid decisions or
little things that people overlook.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cooling thing, I've seen multi-million
dollar grows sit idle half the year
[SPEAKER_09]: because there isn't physically enough
cooling on site to run during the hottest
[SPEAKER_09]: months of the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: The business just needs to make another
300 grand before they can buy an air
[SPEAKER_09]: conditioner big enough to cool their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's like having a dope,
like a Ferrari or a rocket or a Tesla,
[SPEAKER_00]: but missing parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to keep working.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen other grows just say,
fuck it and grow when it's way too hot and
[SPEAKER_09]: put out a super airy product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they just have it all blasted
into hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited that the winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get free air cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just filter that air that comes in,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring in ice crystals
and fungus from outside, but filter that
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_09]: The temperature swing and the giant
concrete wall that you didn't think about
[SPEAKER_09]: once while you were planning, causing
massive powdery milt and mold growth
[SPEAKER_09]: because of the temperature swing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how many people didn't see that
coming in their original plans?
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you heat a foot and a half
thick concrete wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved into one house that had a basement
with one concrete exterior wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first time that I grew in that
basement in the winter, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: White rhino plant, like a five ounce
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a frosted Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got all funked up with powdery hildu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched another guy, what he thought
were the best plants in the harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we finally got back to them,
the section of wall that they were up
[SPEAKER_09]: against was ice cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were, I mean, it was the craziest
looking pink mold I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, just foulness.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was because of the temperature
swing.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you multiply that, I mean,
that was like maybe a $400 loss to that
[SPEAKER_09]: grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if that was in an industrial setting,
it'd be $400,000.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have just kept going right down
that row.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a lot of things that you can
look out for and you can expect
[SPEAKER_00]: to see in the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to fix and just put some glue on
it and hope it doesn't break again because
[SPEAKER_00]: you still got work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants need to be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're getting paid what you
deserve to be paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's some shit in the grow that
can be done today, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Never in the grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, little things that you can get
away with at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sometimes for weeks at a time,
you can get away with it at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not fly in an industrial setting.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just so much less room for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are going to stack up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think, I've got eight
hours worth of work to do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll knock that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do eight hours worth of work
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're doing eight hours worth of
work today, something's going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's prepared for the level of work at
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to, you're going to
have to go and clean up something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got nine hours worth of
work to do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to say, I'm not going to
get this last part done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now tomorrow you've got nine hours worth
of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else is going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to call.
[SPEAKER_00]: A piece of equipment is going to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to take a poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to take a little extra
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to go to the store
and pick up a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your nine hour day just turned into a
10 hour day and you don't even get a lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: break and now you're hungry and grouchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you go home and try to take
care of your plants, they're going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit and it's just going to keep
catching up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's some shit you can do today,
do it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweep that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray whatever you got to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up that dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be looking out for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look out for mildew every day and just be
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you some Method 7 so you don't go
blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably one of the best things I
could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good sunglasses and sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Method 7s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your skin covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers a whole bunch,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy asked a whole bunch of great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: We basically gave you like the $5,000
consult fee in an episode and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send donations to my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I think that's all that we've got for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we handled that for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want more information on any part
of that, there was a lot of information
[SPEAKER_09]: and I know this applies to a lot more than
just the guy asking the questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: So feel free to shoot us for the questions
that the email Jeff keeps giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear, I love generating,
I love creating listener-generated
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know I'm giving you what you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you went to the restaurant and
you ordered exactly what you wanted and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to whip that up like the chef and
bring it out to you and serve it hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fresh for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me email
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to get in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check that email very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It jingles in my pocket when you send me
an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, tell everyone how they can find you
on social media so that they can go stalk
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for
Sensible Cannabis Laws or on Twitter at
[SPEAKER_09]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you come up with that, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been curious.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've literally had it since 15.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where the 15 comes from.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nemo is just no one and I liked that when
I was 15 and then punk because I was 15
[SPEAKER_09]: and I thought it was cute because you were
a little punk when you were 15.
[SPEAKER_09]: Six years later, Finding Nemo comes out
and I was like, meh.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just never got around to changing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I went to create a Twitter handle,
it was like, do you want to use the
[SPEAKER_09]: hotmail account you've had since you were
15?
[SPEAKER_09]: I clicked sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're 159 episodes in and I'm
stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemopunk15, follow me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at GFYH Podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find me at RastaJeff420.

Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be really cool if you follow me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Iree UnderscoreGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about 20,000 and they deleted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took me down, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it because now none of my,
no, I can't say none, but my followers are
[SPEAKER_00]: not bots and I'm not following a bunch of
bullshit accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of got to refresh or restart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more, I get more likes now than I
did before.
[SPEAKER_09]: I found a silver lining to that nasty
little cloud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow me on Instagram, you guys.

[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for listening to the bonus episode,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate your loyalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sure do, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my ninja Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a medical need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they call me from
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed, weed, I love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the mouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just smoke is tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow from your heart podcast,
your source for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he opened it, you guys,
it was just like, I made a little pop
[SPEAKER_00]: noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the mic picked it up,
but you could hear it and you could feel
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all kinds of shit came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he squeezed a bunch of stuff out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, he got so much stuff out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could feel almost as soon as he cut
it open, I could feel relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just feel the pressure just come
off of my skin and off my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, it felt so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he stuck a bunch of gauze inside of
there, a bunch of wadding to suck up all
[SPEAKER_00]: the pus and goo that would be coming out
of my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he wrapped it up for a little
bit, or put some medicine on there and
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me to change that in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 24 hours later, I had to take off the
wrapping that he put on it and I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that gauzey stuff out of my finger,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the funkiest experiences
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of shit tucked into my
finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I put more medicine on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, JB helped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to JB for helping me do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She put some medicine on my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wrapped it up again and been
going about my business and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: re-wrapping it and putting medicine on it
about every 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking really good now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, it's been, let's see, I'm going to
count days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been four or five days and it's
basically fine by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a little bit of scabbing on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't bleed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they put me on these antibiotics,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These antibiotics make me feel so
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make me nauseous as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give me some stomach problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be around when I take
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For like two hours after I take them,
I'm just miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My finger doesn't hurt anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got a few more of the
antibiotics to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole fucking situation will be over
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my guidance to you guys, wear some
rubber gloves when you're working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden or be sure to wash your hands
really, really well with some
[SPEAKER_00]: antibacterial soap because I didn't do
either one of those apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wear gloves unless I'm getting
into some shit that I know is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure that working in the
gardens did not help with this infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't blame it on gardening,
but I'm like 95% sure that this funky shit
[SPEAKER_00]: under my fingernail came from working in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wear some gloves, cut your fingernails,
take care of your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me, like I do have dreadlocks
and I grow weed, but I am kind of OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of a clean dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wash my hands constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing that I'm the dude that got a
fingernail infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it can happen to me, it can happen
to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys wash your hands, wear some
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finger's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them at first just to cut it off
because it hurts so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, just cut it at the fucking
knuckle, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a couple shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it sound like these shots,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, these shots really hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please keep your hand very still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy was like holding, the doctor
was holding my hand in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, please don't wiggle because I don't
want to hurt you with this needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stay still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to hurt a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he stuck that needle in me,
I was like, oh dude, why did you hype me
[SPEAKER_00]: up on how bad that was going to hurt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that didn't fucking hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he had, everybody had me more scared
than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why'd you do that to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just barely poked and kind of burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It itched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wanted to reach over and scratch
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm scratching my hand right now,
just thinking about the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to get to
the point of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a purpose today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the season, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is harvest time in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of California is probably working
through their harvest, but I got an email
[SPEAKER_00]: from a listener and he asked us,
oh, this phone is trying to make me update
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to update.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the worst timing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iPhone wants me to update to the new
operating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, happy croptober.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, happy croptober, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to skip his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, my name is blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'm a long time listener and
have used so much of your information here
[SPEAKER_00]: legally in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you repost your curing episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured tis the season and I'm sure
people could use a curing refresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely going to give you a curing
refresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to repost the old episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that'd be cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go ahead and redo a
fresh episode on how to cure your freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that though, there is a
second half to this email that was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just written to me that I don't think
needs to be read on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll respond to the email personally,
but on the air, let me say that I am glad
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could be there to help you when
things are rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I truly appreciate the email like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry for your troubles,
but I'm glad that I could be there to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you out the little bit that I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend asked us to do a drawing and
curing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my throat's already clogged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I could use a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for one
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sip on some frosty cold Dr.
Pepper, and I'm going to take a fad dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, we're going to do a
quick lesson on drying and curing your
[SPEAKER_00]: freshly harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am freshly
medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am freshly hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about drying and curing your
freshly harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to something that is super
important that I know I talk about a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I find it to be really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 to 14 days before you plan on
harvesting your plants, flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need is clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're watering your plants anyway,
or they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about two weeks before harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't predict it that well,
10 days is cool, but try to go 10 full
[SPEAKER_00]: days at minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather go 10 to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 is what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in cocoa, 10 days is plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in some soil, soilless mix,
you're going to want to go 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you got to do, the first day that
you decide to flush, just fill that pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with, get some, if you really want to pH
the water, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a small crop, pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using a large crop,
like I run seven gallon pots, so it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of water to flush my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pH all of that water to be honest
with you, to tell you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, just fill up your reservoir
and water your plant heavily, a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where you're getting a little extra
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've got saucers underneath your
plants, water it until there's runoff in
[SPEAKER_00]: those saucers for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some extra more than usual,
because you're trying to wash that water
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the next 10 to 14 days,
don't feed it anything but clean water,
[SPEAKER_00]: just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to pH it, go ahead,
but just give it water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean those plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make your plants burn
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to smoke better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your ashes will be nice and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your joints will burn more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever gone to the dispensary and
bought weed and you grind it up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grinder and you start smoking it and your
ashes burn and they're kind of black and
[SPEAKER_00]: the joint doesn't burn right and it tastes
a little funky?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because that cannabis was probably
not flushed properly and it still got
[SPEAKER_00]: funky shit in it that you don't really
want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could have been a lot better had it
been flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also probably could have been better
had it been trimmed and cured,
[SPEAKER_00]: dried and cured properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so frustrating that people will
spend so long on plants and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't flush properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get 14 days of not having to spend
money on nutrients and it's just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to water anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water heavily, let them dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get a little bit dry,
you'll see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the leaves start going and you can
see them, do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water the shit out of them and do that for
the next 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them water them, dry them,
water them, dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to get at least four
good flush cycles in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the first day, the big heavy one on
the first day of the two week cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe Monday, Thursday, Monday and
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's four good waters that you can get
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to actually let the plants
dry out a little bit before I harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right before you harvest, just kind of
let them chill out, let them dry a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a few days before harvest,
maybe two or three days before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go in there and take off all of
the large leaves, the leaves that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to end up being thrown away or that
are in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got a large petiole and I can
get to them and they don't have resin on
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I will cut those leaves off now
while the plants are standing and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and those leaves are sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut all those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes harvesting so much easier when
it comes down to cutting down the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have all those leaves hanging
in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already gotten rid of them and
you're a step ahead of yourself because
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest can get overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one light, if you've got
four lights, if you've got 10 lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will get overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with that one light, that one pound
of weed is going to take you, if it's your
[SPEAKER_00]: first harvest, you're going to be sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut off those extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to be in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to end up on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to be just fine
without those leaves for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of the growers that does the
extended dark period, like 24 or 48 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of darkness before harvest, chop all these
extra leaves off right before you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark phase and it will really increase
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what I'm talking about,
you guys, a lot of people, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and this is up to you and it's up
to your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more up to the plants you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain strains love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains fucking hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like blueberry and flow really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some silver haze, varietal, I tried it
with, hated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey doesn't seem to approve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what a lot of people do, they will take
a plant and 24 to 48 hours before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will put it in total darkness and let
it sit in the darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant, this puts the plant on
panic mode and it basically makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: finish more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kind of bulk up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start using the last of its energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you do if the sun didn't come
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would kind of freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's whole purpose in life is to
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's goal is to get pollinated,
make seeds and die so that those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: fall on the ground and grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wants to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What its job is to do that is to swell up,
to get bigger so that it can receive more
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I better get some pollen soon
because I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts swelling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts getting bigger and you'll get a
little more density and a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain how true the resin
production is, but I've seen more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it in there for like 36,
48 hours, you'll get a little production,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more indica dominant strains will like
this better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take off the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw in the dark if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that in a large cultivation
facility because we're running a perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've just always got the 12-12
happening because it's easier that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I prefer the 12-12 over the 11-13 that
we've talked about on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about running your lights on
11 on and 13 off because it does show a
[SPEAKER_00]: little better phenotypical expression in a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will also save you, I guess,
if you're running for 63 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nine-week flower cycle, that's 63 hours
of lights that you're going to save that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to pay for electricity,
cooling, and also your gear doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: used that extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to save that much mileage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do that, that works too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want those in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants stay in the dark if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have little plants, you can chop
down the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have larger plants, it's probably
easier to cut it down in sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, I honestly use a coat hanger
and I will take a large plant and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: go from the top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start from the top and work my way
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do, I go from the top and I
usually try to cut off about maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between eight and 12-inch long
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take the top cola and I'll go down
to where I can find the first little
[SPEAKER_00]: branch of nodes that I think will support
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cut below that to where I can use
that branching as its own hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cut the bud and then it will hang
it upside down on the coat hanger that I
[SPEAKER_00]: plan to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hang that coat hanger somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a drying area that's got little
racks for a coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang it wherever works best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the temperature and the
humidity here in just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cut your buds, you hang them on a
coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You continue to work your way down the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a couple of V's sticking
off and you'll start seeing these little
[SPEAKER_00]: V's intersections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just come naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you chop one, hang it up, chop another
one, hang it up until you got your hanger
[SPEAKER_00]: full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave plenty of space on these hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only put, let's see, one, two,
three, four, maybe put like seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, maybe not a whole lot of stuff,
stuff together on these hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want air to be able to get between
your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they're going to dry properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put them on those hangers and hang them
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about where to hang the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to talk about wet
trimming and dry trimming because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ideally hang these plants,
any room that is approximately 65 to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to have approximately 45 to
55% humidity in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a dehumidifier or you may
need a humidifier in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that you may need to
properly dry and cure this product to be
[SPEAKER_00]: top shelf, 100% grade A dry and cured
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, you need a
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets so dry here so quickly that our
buds dry in like four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: People make fun of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call our dispensary weed the Colorado
crunch because it is crunchy by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets trimmed up by a trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets put in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets sent to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets put in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jar gets open and closed all day,
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time it gets to you guys,
it is just super crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to prevent that is to dry it nice
and slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will retain some of that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll retain some of that stickiness and
it'll still be dense and flavorful and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll still burn properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want your drying area to be 65 to
75 degrees, 45 to 55% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need it dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light degrades trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light breaks down THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is not what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you would like to have a fan in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to leave that old air
sitting on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to at least move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can have a blower blowing air out
of the room and exchanging the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: having fresh air coming in and old air
going out, that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we don't all have that type
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a closet or whatever,
make sure you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water that comes out of your buds is
water that will go into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just going to be trapped in the
closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to raise the humidity in
your closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to come out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open that door occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more buds you have tucked in the
space, the more moisture there will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more water you fed the plants right
before harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more moisture there will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're getting rid of the
moisture in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a good idea, you guys, would be a
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put a carbon filter and a
blower in your drying area, it would
[SPEAKER_00]: really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would minimize the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would help keep you discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to make
concentrates out of their buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a carbon filter would also help you
keep dust and contaminants out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I see a lot of people do,
they actually use the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a hydro hut or a
small room, you can use that room as your
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and carrying space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should already have a blower in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should already have climate controls
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that have actually purchased
specific three by three or five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tents and they don't put a light in
it, but they do put the blower up top and
[SPEAKER_00]: they put a little fan in there and then
they just hang the plants upside down in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got one that's one hut that's
being harvested all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a perpetual growth where like
every two or four weeks, one of their huts
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down and then it goes into that hut,
which is actually part of their flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into this other hut, which is
their drying hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those grow huts are good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a room that's very well
controlled if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that's not always possible
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we would talk about wet trimming
and dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've chopped down your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it on these coat hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it hanging up in a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can decide, do I want to wet trim
this stuff or do I want to dry trim it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are benefits to both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a hell of a mess and it takes a
long time to wet trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think wet trimming takes longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to do a little bit neater
of a trim, but in my opinion, I am better
[SPEAKER_00]: at a dry trim and I think it's more time
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wet trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take those buds that are hanging on the
hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them off the hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave them on the hanger or leave them on
the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut the buds off the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trim up all those leaves,
all those funky leaves that are sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim them real close to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they dry, it's going to look even
tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little tiny pieces you can't get to,
those will sink into the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it dries up, you won't be able to
tell they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them back on the hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang them up in your dry area and leave
them there until the sticks snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to do a dry trim,
those plants that you've cut down and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got them on the hanger,
just leave them in your drying area until
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticks snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the sticks snap, that's when we catch
up with your wet trim and dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep saying, when the sticks snap,
and I'm sure some people are saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've either been wet trimmed to where
now you've just got beautiful branches
[SPEAKER_00]: with beautiful buds hanging off of them,
hanging on a hanger in your climate
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled area, or you've got these furry
looking plants with just the little leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: left on them because earlier at
pre-harvest, we cut off all the big
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got these plants and they've just
got little fuzzy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a haircut hanging off of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are hanging up in your dry area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, every about 12 hours, I would
recommend go to those plants and pick a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch and just give it a bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at first, you're going to feel those
plants just bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to bend, and it's going
to be real flexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, you'll notice that those
branches become a little more brittle and
[SPEAKER_00]: a little harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, those branches are going to
snap when you bend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thicker ones are going to take a
little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thinner ones are going to go a little
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe check two or three buds every time
you check when it gets close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry too much at the beginning,
but once you get closer, start paying more
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to this different size buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you feel those stems pop,
once you bend it and it goes click or pop
[SPEAKER_00]: or crunch, you will know it when you feel
it the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, that's what he meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got trimmed buds that are
already trimmed, that's when it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop those buds off of the sticks and we'll
start the curing process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got buds that were going to be
dry trimmed, now is the time to dry trim
[SPEAKER_00]: those, and we'll talk about that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging on the hanger and they're
a little bit furry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just take a branch off the hanger
and you can cut these buds off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks because they are about to go into
the curing bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about hanging
them up anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the buds pop, it is fine to take them
off the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your buds, the stems pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take those down and if it's easier
for you to trim it while it's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stick, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's easier for you to trim it after
you cut it off the stick, go for it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, although I am not your trim boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working for someone else,
you got to do it how they tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow their rules, especially if they're
paying you, especially if they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow their rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the leader of that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to adjust to their shit,
but check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they come to your house to help you
grow, you get to make the rules also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leader of the grow gets to make the
trim rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to make the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I have not mentioned,
almost this entire process, wear rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that at the beginning of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time when you're in the garden,
put on rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that shit in your hands and
the plants don't want your hands on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're wearing gloves and you cut
your buds and they're cut off the sticks
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're on the sticks and they're
fairly dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either use scissors or I use my
thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I will take basically a stick
with buds on it and I will just take my
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb and kind of just twiddle my thumb
around these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just make a little up and down motion
and I knock the leaves right off the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: without disturbing the bud too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll catch onto what I mean once you do
it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hold the bud almost like a video game
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm looking at my hands and use
your thumbs just to knock off the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find where the perfect angle to use
your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little thumbnail in my right hand
that I use so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use it even through a glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are fairly dry at this
point and the leaves are already crispy
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've been hanging up for so
long that you're just going ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking off those crispy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need scissors, get scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and cut off all those funky
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell what needs to come
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you just want clean looking buds
that aren't leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please trim your buds, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can save all, if you're wet
trimming or dry trimming, you can save all
[SPEAKER_00]: of your material and you can make
concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot recommend anybody to make their
own BHO if they're not experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know somebody that is a
qualified expert in making butane honey
[SPEAKER_00]: oil, you can make some BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make bubble hash out of it,
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make edibles, that's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make some topicals,
if you want to put it in coconut oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do all of that with your trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your dry buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dry trimming them with your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those are dry, once the buds are all
trimmed, I feel like the buds that we wet
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed earlier, that we just cut off the
sticks in the last part I talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these dry trimmed buds that we just
trimmed with our thumbs, I think we're at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same point with those in the same
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our two characters have caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now either way, you've got a pile of
beautifully trimmed, and maybe you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back and hand trim those other buds
that you did before also a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they've dried, you may notice
some stuff you missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go back and clip them up a
little bit, get in there with some
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you got a pile of beautifully
trimmed, perfectly grown buds right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: just where the stick snapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is where the curing process
actually begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we're 25 minutes into the
episode, but I wanted to get you here
[SPEAKER_00]: properly because you can't get your black
belt until you got all the belts in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to talk about curing
this perfectly dried and trimmed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not referred to any notes in this
whole episode, and I am not going to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: up any notes to actually tell you this
part about why we want to cure our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's basically my understanding of why
curing slowly is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the main part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another reason to it also,
but mainly chlorophyll tastes like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is a part of your plants that
makes them green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get rid of as much chlorophyll
as we can from the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way that you can get rid of
chlorophyll, the only way it can evaporate
[SPEAKER_00]: is by evaporating with moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is the only way it can go away,
but it's got to break down before it can
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate with moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to happen slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we try to cure slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another thing that happens is the
THC transfers from, or it changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it transforms from THC to THCA is my
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by dropping a water molecule,
which is what happens when the water
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly evaporates, it becomes much more
psychoactive and much more available to us
[SPEAKER_00]: when we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I said that wrong, I would love to
hear your correction because that is just
[SPEAKER_00]: off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is my little mental library of
science of why we cure cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly the reason I cure cannabis,
because it makes it taste better,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes it burn better, and it gets me
higher, and it just makes it better
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want a basic reason or a science
reason, that is why we want to cure our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis properly and slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your flush phase done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your pre-harvest done where you
chopped off all those extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we either wet trim them or we cut off
all the leaves and now they're hanging up
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're pretty, or we dry trim them,
which we let them hang for a while and
[SPEAKER_00]: they looked ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the stems cracked,
but the buds were not brittle,
[SPEAKER_00]: you still want those buds nice and moist
so they're fluffy and sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's what we're aiming for,
fluffy and sticky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got those cleaned up and now we've
got these pile or this pile of beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you grew, you got this beautiful
pile of lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems were popping beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get some glass jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want like either cur or ball glass
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the larger ones with the wide
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put, just gently drop the buds
into the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pack them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drop buds into the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them sit on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it up about 75 to 90% of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to stuff them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it only halfway full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it like 75 to 90% of the way
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to put the lid on that jar
and repeat, put all your buds in jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep going until you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have a lot of jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you get tired of filling jars
with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill all your jars with buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put those jars in a cool,
dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the same environment,
similar to the environment that we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in while they were drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're in a jar, but we still want
to keep them cool and dry and we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still science happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep them dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm kind of weird and I have a lot of
time to dedicate to my buds and my
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go back about two hours later
and open that jar for just a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, maybe five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the air to move around in that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it fluff around and then I close
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll come back about four hours later
and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then before I go to bed, I will actually
dump out all of the buds out of the jar
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will rearrange them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put them back in the jar and
I'll leave the jar open for a good three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four or five minutes because I want
fresh air around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want any stagnant spot where they've
been pressed together, where they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: sweating on each other, I want to give
them some breathing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any mold to happen inside
that jar is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll crack it open at like two hours
and then four hours and then six hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll try to go to bed for a few hours
and ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first thing I'm going to do when I
wake up is go crack open those jars and
[SPEAKER_00]: smell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, they're going to smell wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to smell like damp weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting a hay smell or an
ammonia smell, you're done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You left it closed for too long or you put
it in there too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it super wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's super wet, leave it open a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some of that water come out or open it
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want mold starting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open up the jar like I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four hours, six hours, eight hours,
12 hours, and then start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more it dries, the more slowly,
the more less frequently you can open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to be opening that jar once
or twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it burping the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to burp that jar once or twice
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after about five to seven days,
you're going to notice the buds are dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're still spongy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll squeeze them and they'll kind of
compress and then they'll fluff back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll break them open in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a little bit of moisture
still, but they'll smell real dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have a really good smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke it, it's going to burn
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lock them into that jar and leave it
in there and only open it once a day after
[SPEAKER_00]: the first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're getting where they're
smokable, just leave them in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: only open that jar once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you take out,
if you think you're going to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to smoke seven grams of
weed a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out seven grams for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in your head stash jar and leave
the rest in the cure jar so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave it sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every day or other day,
go pull out how much you're going to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next couple of days and leave the
rest of that stuff in there to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still damp, but they're dry-ing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want plenty of moisture in there,
but you don't want them too moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're juicy, you don't want to put
them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're kind of, as soon as those
stems pop, you should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in the jar, seal that jar up,
put it in a dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every, just increase your
timeframe and pay attention to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got multiple jars, experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open one up every four hours and see what
it's like, and then leave a couple of them
[SPEAKER_00]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go too long with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ever want to go, like right
away, I would say check them every four to
[SPEAKER_00]: six hours in the beginning and then
increase that time until you go every 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To judge how often your jars need to be
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to give you timeframes,
but I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to mess up your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you have different temperatures,
if you have different humidity problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you may, if you leave it closed too
long, you may cause a mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every art, there's some trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to fuck up and try not to make
errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my best advice to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to mess up a little bit,
but don't mess up a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to mess up once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't learn how to ride that bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool until you crashed a couple of
times and then he learned what you could
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my, my quick crash course on how
to dry and cure your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like once your cannabis is properly
dried and cured, it can be stored for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some weed for three to six months
before I've stored weed for a year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep it in the proper conditions
and the proper environment, different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains will keep for different amount of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some stuff that I kept in a
refrigerator in the back for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hid some weed from myself in a freezer
and I forgot about it and I found it when
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved out of that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weed tasted really terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it in the freezer did something
weird to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a little bit ago, I gave a
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a man with a whole bunch of
passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the show is called Grow From
Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I definitely need a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed my lesson on how to
cure cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I wrap up the show, I want to send
my love to all of the people affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to send a huge thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to all of the people who helped
put out those fires and also all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: support involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Law enforcement, people that volunteered
bringing the firefighters water and food,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that participated in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart goes out to all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my heart goes out to all of the
people that lost their homes and their
[SPEAKER_00]: property and were affected by that.

[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had horns and yeah, it looked like a
Viking sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Logan and Cody hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Lydia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abigail looked adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinsey looked adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'm just going to rattle on a bunch
of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everyone at freaking the
Heady Halloween party.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we do that again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into the main topic of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more thing I have to talk
about before I get into the main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a new mic cover on this microphone,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to replace the microphone covers
on these mics so that not everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: spitting into the same thing and rubbing
their face on the same shit for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just gave myself a fresh new one and
it stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like shoe polish or something
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, I keep sniffing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, what do I have to do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to give a shout out to my friends
at thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a lot of people have been asking
me, of course, I am I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed, I bred the grateful dog,
the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm pretty much known for the
Arise is what's been going on this real
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made Arise F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got cascade available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I am I read genetics and a lot of
people know that and they ask me for
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are local in Colorado and you can
find me, maybe we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cannot ship seeds to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my friends at the Dankteam,
they can ship you seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thedankteam.com check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got I read genetics products in
stock right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got head stomper.

[SPEAKER_00]: They probably have some Black Cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably have some Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have, I'm not sure what else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise you what else they may
have because they only got a few packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have some Dubwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what else is left over there

[SPEAKER_00]: I fully endorse thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, let's get into the main
topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing I want to talk about,
I was on a forum the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do read the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I troll around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not use a name that anybody would
recognize me by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't find me on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also in a bunch of Facebook groups,
but I've had to check out of a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Facebook groups because honestly,
I see so I apologize for all the throat
[SPEAKER_00]: clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I was taking some fat dabs of
some live resonant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just got me all clogged up,
but we'll deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get through a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll quit right about the time the show
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a bunch of bullshit in Facebook
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I see people recommending the
shittiest advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go look at the person that gave
that advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at their pictures of their grow and
I can see why their grow looks the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: does and why they're giving the advice
that they are giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of frustrates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to leave a bunch of Facebook
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in a lot of them, but I do go
troll around and browse around the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lately, a topic I've seen more than
once or twice is people were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to determine flowering times of new
seeds and new clones that they've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: that they don't have any information on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody got some bag seed and they
don't know how long to let that bag seed
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, or maybe somebody was gifted a
clone and they don't know anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: the clone from the friend that gave it to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were like, hey, Ross DeGeoff,
how do I determine how long to let these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants flower so that I don't fuck up my
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, I'm going to get some water
here and fix up my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to take a couple more
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we're going to talk
about how to determine flowering time of
[SPEAKER_00]: new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised we would talk about ways to
determine flowering time of new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you got some seeds and you don't
know how long those seeds are supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you had a bunch of packs of seeds
and these got mixed up or mislabeled or
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't labeled at all, or maybe they came
out of a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got seeds that you're running
and you have no idea what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to know how long to
let those plants flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your buddy gave you clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you bought clones at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you cut clones and you don't know
which clone that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to determine how long to let that
plant flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously the easiest way to do that
would to be flower that plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then around week seven or eight,
maybe eight or nine, I would say about
[SPEAKER_00]: week seven, get in there and start looking
at that plant with a loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a magnifier of some sort of a
magnifying glass, some sort of an eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need at least a 60 to 100 times
magnifying glass to look at these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see the trichomes that are on
your buds and look in a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: places on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just look in one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I use hooks up to my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a, let me see, I can go right
here on my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll remind me the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Dinoscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Dinoscope, a little,
it's a scope that hooks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a magnifying scope that hooks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a USB port.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes right into my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works with a Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works with a Windows machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it on a Mac, so I promise it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bitch to get it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I downloaded the driver and got
it working, it works beautifully every
[SPEAKER_00]: time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take screenshots of what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this little scope, I basically,
I can take, I take my chair because it
[SPEAKER_00]: rolls and has wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put the MacBook on the chair because
I'm clumsy and I like to drop shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I leave the MacBook on the chair and I
roll it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use the scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice long cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use that scope to go find the
spot that I want on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I look at the screen and I can
see if the trichomes are amber or if the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes are clear or if they're milky or
if they're busted, ruptured open and got
[SPEAKER_00]: shit dripping out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the scope I've got, I can see bug
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is bug shit in my plants,
I can see any insect in the world with
[SPEAKER_00]: this scope that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to pull a leaf off randomly and
look at the underside of the leaf and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for eggs, looks for bugs,
look for bug shit, look for signs of bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you need if you can't get that
type of a thing for your computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sell the 420 scope is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they call it the dope scope or the
420 scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one sold at the grow store that is
made by Hydrofarm, which is the one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the 100X little scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a AA battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It folds, it may take two batteries,
but it folds, it folds together real
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you unfold it, it lights up and
then you can see through it real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I really like, but get yourself a
scope so that you can look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes at least 60X, 100X magnification
is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most obvious way to tell when
plants are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: When within your view, you're probably
going to see a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to count them,
but you want about 25 to 30% of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 to 30% of those, you want them turning
amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to kind of look like the
color, like maybe you dipped them in Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepper, or maybe they got a little,
they're just, you could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns the amber orangish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start off clear, then they'll get
milky and then they get like a silvery
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the silver, that's when they
start turning amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when 30% of your trichomes are amber,
that's usually when you want to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: most strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go a little early, you can go a
little late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that huge of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people way overstressed the
harvest window.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a production facility, we say this
strain gets this many days and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting it the fuck down because we have
another crop coming up right behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weed comes out pretty fabulous in
most of the production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just pick something like 60 days or
70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say 63 days because that's nine
full weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the strains we're running
nowadays, nine weeks is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk a little more because this
scope, the looking at the trichomes is
[SPEAKER_00]: really going to help you out, but you're
going to need to know a little earlier in
[SPEAKER_00]: the game when to harvest because you're
going to need to flush your plants about
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 14 days before you start cutting
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heavily stress flushing your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free and you've got to water the
plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not just pour a bunch of water in
there and clean the plants out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some ways to determine
how long those plants are going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to figure out how indica or
sativa dominant those plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a huge indicator of that is leaf shape
and size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaf has really long slender
fingers, it's probably sativa dominant and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to lead more toward the nine
to 10 week range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants have big fat broad leaves,
if they're real wide, if the wider the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, probably the shorter the flowering
period is something that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not always true, but it's usually a
good thing to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got good wide leaves,
you're looking at eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got a eight or nine week
plant, the first time you run it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend going nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not try that extra week to see what
happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get more bulk right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get more resin right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may harden up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may do a lot of good shit in that last
one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to over-ripen too much,
but don't worry about a little
[SPEAKER_00]: over-ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that huge of a game, especially
if it's your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I wrote down that I
wanted to wait a little while to mention,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is hopefully not your last time
running this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your first time running this
strain, which means you can fuck it up
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have another time and another
time and another time after that to run
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully if this is a good genetic,
a good cultivator, and you can keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: around, you're going to be running it a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just your test run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your first state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaf size and leaf shape will give you
a big hint on how long those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an eight or nine week plant,
like I just said, like the eight or nine
[SPEAKER_00]: week indica, let it go nine weeks because
you want it to go to full maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant with long skinny
leaves, that's a nine to 10 week plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend letting that plant go 10
weeks the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see what the potential of that
plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those sativa plants really do
magical shit toward the end of their
[SPEAKER_00]: growth phase or at the end of their
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bulk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They resin up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really put on some flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get better at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably swelling up because they
want to be bred to, and you're not giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just getting bigger and bigger
and stickier and fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it's better to let those
sativa strains go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like an 11 week sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't scare me to run a 77 day sativa
dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower it when it's real short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready to have some sticks and supports
available and get that sucker going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to grow something that
takes 77 days or even maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually get more weight and everybody
loves that good sativa buzz, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's growing those shorter indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing a heady sativa,
you're going to stand out from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical users are going to appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational users are going to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to help everybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic leaf size is a good indicator
of how long your strain may take from the
[SPEAKER_00]: very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's real broad, you're looking at
eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some skinny leaves,
go nine or 10 weeks, maybe even a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is if you start flushing a
little bit too early, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start flushing too late,
that's when you start overdoing things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got these plants that are
going to end up taking 13 or 14 weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already started flushing to be
prepared for week 11, you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to start looking a
little ragged.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn a little bit yellow,
but they'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a really long sativa,
something that I should mention,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new grower and you're growing
a long sativa longer than 11 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be lucky if by the end of that
grow, that plant has any big leaves left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants like to, they're finicky and
they will lose a lot of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look like shit, but you'll have
amazing medicine still because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy and a plant that goes that long is
meant to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of experienced growers have a hard
time with a longer flowering plant because
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeding regimen is kind of confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not sure when to phase certain
nutrients out and when to phase certain
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in because everything happens at
a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're all taught about these nine
week plants, everybody, all the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that sell you stuff,
most of the stuff you see online,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're recommending feeding,
they're basing that on about an eight to
[SPEAKER_00]: nine week flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them don't even give you
enough time to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most tell you to flush for one week
because they want you to keep pumping
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking product into your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point to all of this is that you
can't really over flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared to flush, flush like
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plants look like they want
longer, let them go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell if they want to go longer by
using the scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the only way you can
get in there and tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, something that will give you a hint
of how long the plants are going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: is the basic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: My words are hard to say today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic structure of your plants,
how tall they get, how quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much they branch out, how bushy the
plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it growing straight up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant's going straight up and not
making a lot of side branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably got yourself a sativa
dominant plant that's going to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little longer to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to keep going straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that is growing
really long, lanky branches, and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: going really, really fast, that plant may
take a little longer to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant is staying short and stocky
and real squatty and just getting wider
[SPEAKER_00]: and wider as it grows, you've probably got
an indica dominant plant, which is also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to put that trait
together with your leaf size and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: put those two together and let those two
things kind of give you hints of how much
[SPEAKER_00]: indica and how much sativa are in those
plants and how long you should let them
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got seeds and the breeder pack
says that they're done in eight to nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, I recommend you let them go nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even let them go a little bit longer
if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let stuff go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like things to go nine, 10 or 11 weeks
just because it's easier to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of strains that I run.
[SPEAKER_00]: 63 days is perfect for most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically ways to figure out
flowering times of new seeds and new
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the trichomes if you've got a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can hook your scope up to your
computer, I recommend you check in three
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check at the top of the plant,
that big top bud, check that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check in the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know how you got the top and if you
didn't do any topping, you got a top and
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's buds that come up right
underneath that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part of the crown, the next part
of the bouquet, check some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check like right around that ring there
and then go down a little bit further in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and check down there and see how
the difference is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be really amber down at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be really clear at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to harvest one about 30% of the
total trichomes have started to show
[SPEAKER_00]: amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of looks like you got a little
bit of Dr. Pepper on them or a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of root beer or something and they're just
starting to turn a little bit brownish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait too long, they all start
turning that color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the kind of the plants lose
their flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut them a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut them sooner, they taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut them a little bit later,
they probably get heavier and more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you want to balance on
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are focused on getting as much
as they can from each light or each square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot or each square meter or each table,
however you're growing nowadays and
[SPEAKER_00]: however you're doing the measurement for
your own business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people want to let it go that
extra few days and add on that extra bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, they just get more potent in
my opinion as you let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, that's mostly ways to kind of
predetermine how long to let your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I wrote down a couple
of more notes that I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was inspired to rant on because of
this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I get that far, I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me sound weird when I say that I
need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to take a dab with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were in a safe place where you
can smoke, start getting a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the lid off of some Golden Goat
Shatter from TR Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Golden Goat Shatter is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little left because I really
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep coming up to the table where the
enail is and I'm like, I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little dab of that Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just get a little dab of it and I
take a dab and I get the flavor on my
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I take just such a little dab that it
doesn't really get me high because I take
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of dabs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a lot of big dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be like, shit, I'm going to take
another little dab and I'll take another
[SPEAKER_00]: little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after like two or three of those,
I'll be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take a big dab and I'll
take a big dab that I should have just
[SPEAKER_00]: started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I end up really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gram of Golden Goat Shatter has
not lasted very long at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job to whoever grew the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a really good job to our friends
at TR Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just straight shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about different consistencies of
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a little paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of glass wrapped in parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that sharp because it's more like
Jolly Ranchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you had a sheet of Jolly
Rancher, it would just be snappy like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to fold it back up so that I
can put this away.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the hash onto the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the hash put away, putting it
back in my childproof child safe
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like keeping it in that container
because it's labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of the flavors over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got me a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat up the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm smoking on a quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some different nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you see me using the
e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever watched me on Instagram,
it's a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made out of titanium and it's got a
cord attached to it and actually attaches
[SPEAKER_00]: to a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that box keeps the nail at the
appropriate temperature for taking dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not using that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is right here next to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turned on, but I want to use this rig
that I won.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a normal bowl,
like a pipe bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically just a little dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quartz dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pinky deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a thimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a thimble, you guys,
but it's quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's got a little piece that
goes into the rig and it goes into the rig
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of like where a bong bowl would
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course I'm using the rig I won
from Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pumpkin looking rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a little pumpkin on the back,
which is the coolest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to heat the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to hear me probably
while I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of compression going on here,
but I don't think it'll cut this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while I heat it, make sure you check
out zadankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a fresh drop of irie genetics
in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check them out for
feminized and regular cannabis seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys are in just a couple
of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab of this Golden
Goat and then we will get on with this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you dabbing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're heating the nail right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nails got to cool because I just way
overheated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cleaning off some funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll let the nail cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, let's dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels cool now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bigger than I needed for a podcast,
but what could go wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to sit here and talk into a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent work to my friends at TR
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Golden Goat Shatter is a maze balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head will quit spinning here in just a
couple of seconds and we're going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: on with the parts that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad I wrote them down because I would
have forgotten by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take one last drink here and then
we'll get on with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I hope you took a fat dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're dabbing with me while you're
listening to the show, send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me at GFYH Podcast on Twitter,
at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know that you're smoking with
me and I'd love to know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to the notes that I wrote
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down that phenotype variations
will take different times to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means if you buy a package of seeds,
not every seed in that package is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take the same amount of time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get one phenotype that takes nine
weeks and you may get one phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: takes 10 weeks to flower out of the same
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason for that, I'll explain a
little bit why.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes to do, when I talk about F1 and
F2 breeding and F3 and F4, when you make
[SPEAKER_00]: an F1, it's got a very wide variety of
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring out traits from the mother
plant and the father plant that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using, the female and the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the girl plant that received the pollen
and the male plant that threw pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits are going to show,
but also the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever female you used, the male and
female used for that are going to show up
[SPEAKER_00]: in your F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever you used for the male,
the male and female used to make that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to show up in your F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see grandma,
you're going to see grandpa, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also going to see grandma and
grandpa on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're also going to see mommy
and you're also going to see daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have a lot of different
phenotypes popping up from some F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get one that takes eight weeks,
you may get one that takes 10 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make those F1s, there's a lot
of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do as breeders, we find the
most desirable female that you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: out of all of your seeds, out of the F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the one that is whatever you're
looking for, the best stink or the best
[SPEAKER_00]: growth or the best resin, you want the
best all-around girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to take pollen from the
male from the same generation and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen onto that girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds that come from there will be
called F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2s will be a little bit more stabilized,
meaning you're not going to see as much
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of the grandparents pop up
in the seeds, but you're going to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit closer to the mommy and daddy,
and you're going to start narrowing it
[SPEAKER_00]: down a little bit more closely to what
you're trying to make with that seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something interesting that happens with an
F2 cross is called transgressive
[SPEAKER_00]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually see the kids outperform the
parents is generally what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll also go the other way also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see weaker traits also,
but we call those as breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see if you put a gigantic male
and a gigantic female, and the male makes
[SPEAKER_00]: super stank and the female makes super
resin, you put them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just may make the super hulk on your
F2s because you're going to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: transgressive segregation come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly in the F2 generation is where I
find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I would find my favorite F2,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The best looking girl of that F2 that's
got the traits I'm going after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it was very similar to the F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You found the one that looked like you
were going after, and then you go find
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that looks like that,
that's an F2 or that's improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hit it with the pollen from
the F2 male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to find a male and a female,
and then you hit the female with the male
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those seeds come out,
you've now made F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I'm getting at is every time you
do that, if you do it correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you have to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep a bag of seeds from the
old ones and go back and re-hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it correctly, when you go
through each time, you're going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that strain more stable and more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll start off with like five
different phenotypes and you breed it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now hopefully you just worked it down
to like three solid phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you breed it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got two solid phenotypes to
where when you grow these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're 50-50 going to get this one or this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's going to be kind of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully you can breed it down
to where by the time you get to F5,
[SPEAKER_00]: which takes a long time, you guys,
that is years of breeding and years of
[SPEAKER_00]: developing, because you got to find the
males and the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes you don't find what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you finish a crop and you just start
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually searched through,
I'd say 250 seeds to find in a rise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw away a good portion of the
females that popped up because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: what I needed at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time you get to the F5,
you'll be growing out these seeds and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will look like clones if you do it
correctly, five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think F5 is about where they'll come out
really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: F6 will look like clones, but I wouldn't
want to take it that far because then
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody else could breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be whatever you bred to it
would come out looking like that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd just be real dominant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time you breed to it,
if you do it correctly, it makes it more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm getting at is a lot of the
breeders on the market right now are
[SPEAKER_00]: selling you F1s, which is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage Green sells F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite brands to buy is
Gage Green Genetics because I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: variation that comes in the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see a lot of neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had the honor of being a tester
for Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see a lot of great shit come
out of their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to test a lot of great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love F1s because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get an F1 that takes eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get an F1 that takes nine weeks
from the same exact pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to cut that one down early and
change your feeding regimen and have two
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants that you've got to feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you just want to let them all go 60
days, 64 days, 56 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to decide that stuff, but that's a
decision you've got to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can tell early on in flower that
one has kind of taken off and getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit taller than the others,
I mean, you may have some thinking to do
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the beginning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different seeds are the same seed pack,
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have different flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love searching through seed packs
and finding the phenotypes because
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what you're working with,
you may find some really great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also find some ridiculous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the same pack, I found completely
purple buds that were short and compact
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants make purple, bright purple
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've also had plants that make
tall, velvety, bright green buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't decide which phenotype to
keep, so I kept them both and I called
[SPEAKER_00]: them just different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenohunting is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect some variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, something I wrote down is different
flowering times in different rooms and
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I gave you clones, if I gave you
clones and I gave one of your other
[SPEAKER_00]: friends clones, and I gave a couple other
guys clones and you guys all took it to
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room, you may see that your room
wants these plants to flower in 58 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be perfectly finished in 58 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I give somebody else plants,
they may need 63 days if we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: right down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So environmental can have a lot to do with
it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, indoors and outdoors, you're going
to see huge differences in different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buds are going to look completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're growing them in California,
if we're growing them in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: altitudes make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental factors like that will play
a huge difference in your flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've gone on for a long enough,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 32 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm going to wrap up the
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for
