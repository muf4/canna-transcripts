friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of stuff to ramble
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, let's jump right
into the email portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came to us from a person named
Sam and it says, you can use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes things a lot easier for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can just say this came from Sam
and it says, I'm a relatively new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm a disabled veteran with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few years ago, I began discovering
that cannabis is an amazing medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: is much healthier than alternative to
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, Sam, thank you for your
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate what you've done for the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what that's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably different PTSD, but it still
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bro, thank you for your service and
thank you for the support on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you're growing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, also, I'm glad you're
using cannabis instead of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I too am a, I'm an alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had alcohol in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not tempted by alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't desire, crave or need alcohol,
but there was a time in my life when
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol was a serious crutch and I was not
the best person I could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: To people around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't responsible with my, uh,
my words, my actions, my health,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, my physical or mental wellbeing were
not important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come a long way since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And life is much better without that
poison in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, wasn't the easiest thing to
quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get rid of friends and lifestyle
changes and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the quit drinking alcohol
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to sympathize with you and say that
I know how that feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really grateful you've joined us
on team cannabis and we've gotten away
[SPEAKER_00]: from team alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I live in a cannabis unfriendly state,
so I can't afford to continue purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: free market cannabis after researching for
almost a year and finally getting my
[SPEAKER_00]: courage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted my first seeds allegedly in the
winter of 2018, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you've stepped up and taken
responsibility for your own medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've used your podcast extensively
to do my research and I've learned a great
[SPEAKER_00]: deal from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: For putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going, it's a, it's a given a
receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full exchange is what I'm saying
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a give and take, and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I still listen regularly
regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some, and I have since made
grow friends in my state through your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of my friends on the
discord server for helping out new
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, old friends, making new friends,
connecting the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a cool place over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says cannabis as a medicine is a very
well-known topic, but I also wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention the therapeutic aspects of the
cannabis growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep reading, but I already want
to say, I fully agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my garden has become a haven for
me that I use to manage my stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me something to research and
learn about when I'm feeling lost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps me to know that I'm part of a
whole community of other home growers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that many of them are veterans as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have come as, as I have come to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that whole statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garden should be your haven,
your safe space, your moment of Zen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was deeply immersed in the commercial
cannabis industry since COVID happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have basically backed out of all of my
commercial cannabis contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not working with any facilities right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to any big places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been more in love with growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal garden has not looked this
good in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was focused on a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was focused on production, schedules,
numbers, weights, potency reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was forgetting the thing that I preach
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still doing that, but that was like
seventh or eighth on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Sam here is growing from his
heart because this plant, this grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: is his Zen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his new playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the place where he could just go and
be himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when I go in my garden,
I put earbuds in and whatever I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to, that's what I got in my
ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn off the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the phone on case the daughter,
but I don't look like if my daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: calls, I'll answer her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's about the only one I'm going to
answer in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my moment of Zen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants need my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That garden is relying on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it feels so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my quiet space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's beautiful in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a snowy day outside, it's fucking
nice in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a hot day outside, beautiful in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always about 78, 79 degrees in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always just the right humidity in
there, just depending on what phase we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in, depending on which room I'm in,
but it's never too extreme in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got my earbuds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either got Joey Diaz yelling at me or
Christa Stefano telling me a dirty joke or
[SPEAKER_00]: fish blaring in my ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just dead silent in there
and it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can mess with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can give me any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing I talk about and
think about is don't think about bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been arguing with somebody,
if you fucking had a fight in traffic,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your neighbor's been being a dick,
if there's something on your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't carry that into the grow room with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're going to put that on the
plants and they're going to be stressed
[SPEAKER_00]: out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I go in there, I make it a point
to just close the door behind me and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the bullshit out there, all the stuff out
here in reality and Babylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets left out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in my grow is good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: John love.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing from my wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing from my ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing for Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share it with Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put some money in my wallet after I
grow, but that wasn't the intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention is to see this beautiful
plant, this amazing product go from point
[SPEAKER_00]: zero to point harvested, dried,
cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then either I get to consume it or one
of my friends gets to consume it or a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis can, consumer gets to
consume it, which is all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all medical cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of us gets to consume that and we're
going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I feel good, but when I
smoke, I feel even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I don't feel good and I
smoke, then I can feel good and then even
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant is very therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be, uh, it shouldn't be thought
of as a commodity, as a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be working all the way from the
beginning to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be building you up and making
you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why I walked away from the,
large scale commercial industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that, but I'm at a point where
it was getting more stressful than it was
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling rewarding and just having my
personal grow my personal business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, there's more passion in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back to growing from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant I touch is grown with full
love because I could touch every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can address every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to tell somebody go water
those all water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will hope they all get watered by
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back to growing pure with love from my
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the love and enjoyment now,
which I think will make all the products
[SPEAKER_00]: better as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get back into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, don't think about your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about how chicks are going to
like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about the drum set or the
guitar or the sneakers or the car you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video games you're going to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sell that product, don't think
about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it's like a meditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you start off with the seed that
doesn't have, it's got life in this little
[SPEAKER_00]: ball and you brought it all the way to
fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to harvest it and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weeks and weeks of nurturing and
meditation and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to spend with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while you're doing that, you're also
meeting this whole group of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think, well, I wonder if my plants are
doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to the internet just to compare
your plants to others or to get advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you find this guy Rasta Jeff,
and then you realize he's approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make friends with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you realize he's got a whole
group of people that hang out with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and made him a discord server and you can
chat with everybody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then not only do you have these
plants, that are, uh, Zen meditative,
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic, and then rewarding,
but then you make friends in a community
[SPEAKER_00]: that are also therapeutic, rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having friends is very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're social creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love having friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does build a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in the garden, the cannabis plant,
the cannabis community is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys already knew that I'm rambling,
but this message meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of get far from the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes we forget our roots,
forget our goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go back and remind myself and
you guys that, um, we're growing medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: to nourish ourselves, our bodies,
our minds, our spirits, however you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all three from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my body feels better when I smoke,
my mind feels better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I use it to Rasta far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it for meditation, use it for
enjoyment, uh, mind, body, spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is feeling better from
consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to remember to grow from our
hearts and not let this plant be a
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity, be a profit, be a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we have commercial facilities
and it is, but go back to your roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: fall in love with this plant again,
like I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never lost my love, but I mean,
now that I've given up the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, I've got more time to really love
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not thinking about time clocks
and employees and schedules and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: deliveries and manifests and fucking
metric numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean like the metric system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, metric, the marijuana enforcement
tracking and regulation, something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use here in Colorado and many other
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the worst damn programs ever
designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes people want to punch
themselves in the face repeatedly over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to mess with that because
I'm not in the commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: More time to love the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, you got me rambling, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for that kombucha burp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the microphone didn't pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even going to edit cause I'm human.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says there are times when my mental
state is in the dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing I look forward to is
trimming or watering or making edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, that is a lot of why I quit
consuming alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to grow and also drinking and
I would go out and get shitty drunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: you forget that night that you got shit to
do in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get shitty drunk and you wake up
and you go throw up and you think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to poop some blood and go back to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you realize, should I got a
garden to go take care of and you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: go play in the grow room hung over?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would much rather grow cannabis sober,
not hung over.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let's get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I said sober, but trust me,
there are dabs and blunts and joints and
[SPEAKER_00]: bong rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting drunk anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be in a grow room drunk,
be under grow lights hung over.
[SPEAKER_00]: No F in thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that contributed a lot to me being a
non alcohol consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having those beautiful plants in there to
wake up to it's like having pets that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to shit on the floor and run
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my plants have never shit on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've had plenty of dog shit right on
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, when the mental state is in the
dumps, sometimes knowing that those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on me, uh, it really does help me
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I seem like an upbeat, positive,
happy, go lucky dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a traumatic brain injury that
sometimes, uh, there are some dark dumpy
[SPEAKER_00]: days for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in the garden for a couple of hours,
I'll go in there thinking, I fucking hate
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll come out being like,
I'm going to call some friends and hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause life is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garden is very therapeutic spending
time with all that living stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very therapeutic, but don't,
don't forget to get some real nature
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize when I started growing
that it would be a tool for me in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a tool in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you didn't mention that I think
you'll discover next, uh, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that now that you're taking good care
of these plants and feeding the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully, the next thing that will fall
in line is you'll start taking better care
[SPEAKER_00]: of yourself physically, health wise,
what you consume, what you eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'll start thinking about the
products you eat better, but not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: things you eat, but where they came from,
how they were made, how they were sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be, you'll get more aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get woke because you're
growing weed and it's going to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already getting a mental boost from
this, which is giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spiritual boost from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you're going to get is a
physical learning lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to realize why do I spend so
much time measuring precise millimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters for products to feed my
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes time for my dinner,
I slap fucking butter and fucking cheese,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of shit in a pan and eat it like
I'm fucking going to live through
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start thinking, well, maybe if I
give myself the appropriate shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'll thrive like my plants do and it
all clicking you one day and you'll go,
[SPEAKER_00]: huh, that's why I felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was just eating fucking all the
wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the next thing you're going to
realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when it comes to your cannabis
adventure, I know this is a really off
[SPEAKER_00]: topic kind of a message, but you guys,
I really feel this is the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start learning about cannabis,
you get that connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, I'm feeding my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should feed myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it happen, especially in commercial
growers, because they're in the grow all
[SPEAKER_00]: day, bust an ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to work harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to eat more and they see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just see the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm in there talking about how I eat
well, and maybe that inspires them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's your next move, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great for your mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my therapist and I have even
discovered that oftentimes when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking and caring for my mental health,
I'm lacking and taking care of my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that how it's a reflection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the way you do something is the way
you do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that mental state starts going
fucking haywire, the garden starts showing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really reflects the whole life starts
looking like it's unraveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go, hi, everything's out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go clean up the garden, start cleaning
up your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You start having better conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mind is more open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start actually wanting to go places
because your brain feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be around people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will spark that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my grow area has become sort of a
metaphor in my life that I can use for
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring as a measuring stick for taking
care of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my friend, if that garden starts
getting out of control, you got to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out to a friend and say, Hey, why am I
doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe just reach inside of yourself and
say, what am I lacking?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I fucking up on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I hating the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I hiding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I being a rebel?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sometimes calling a friend isn't the
best thing to do when you're in the dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just drag them down too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know how to get yourself out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in that grow, take care of business and
feel the pride of the grow then smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: fat one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with all of that to say
learning how to grow from your podcast has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a life changing experience for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, this message was life changing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get messages like this frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of messages, but they never
stop warning me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never stop filling me with pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never stop making me feel good about
what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, knowing that I'm helping you out with
your PTSD, knowing that I, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just me, you, um, my guidance,
my advice has led you to help yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: with your PTSD and get your mental health
on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this sort of stuff is like grow
nutrients for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave me a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave me some recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep me going for a few more episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you're ever wondering,
ever in the dumps, bro, and you need
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to talk to, I'm a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of shit going on,
but if you ever messaged and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a fucking dark day and need a
friend, I'll bring you some fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes to just about everybody out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell me I'm having a dark day and
shit's weird, we'll hang out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot more messages in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure, uh, to cover as much
as I can in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from my friend,
Zachary, you what up Zachary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes, I've got a great question
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow your competitors seeds for
either quality control standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: calling bullshit or just plain fun?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short answer is yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I love to grow my competitors seeds,
but the thing is I'm not going to call
[SPEAKER_00]: them competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call them, uh, colleagues,
my friends, uh, my breeding bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find them to be competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to fucking make sales and do
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a client or a customer came to me and
they said, Hey, I want this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They list off a few details and that
strain is not in my menu, which it
[SPEAKER_00]: probably is because I have a vast menu
with a lot of things and I know it pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you say I want something and I
don't have it, I'll recommend something
[SPEAKER_00]: from another breeder because that is my
job as a responsible grower, as a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible community leader, just as a
fucking polite person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and people have seen me do it and
they've been like, bro, that person would
[SPEAKER_00]: have bought seeds from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could be like, yeah, they would have
bought seeds, but they would not have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten what they wanted and they would
have wasted their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at harvest time, they would have been
like, man, fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold me the wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, they went and got the seeds they
wanted from one of my friends who's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a colleague.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in the same gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went and got the seeds they wanted
from somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew them and now they made two
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, damn, these seeds are fucking
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that guy Rasta Jeff
recommended me those.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have taken my a hundred bucks and
fucked me and just gave me something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, he said, go over there and
visit Duke diamond or go visit ethos or
[SPEAKER_00]: miss Jill, because they've got what you're
asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't, I find that to be the way
to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not my competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We message each other on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk, we see each other at all of the
events we travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're all doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live and learn with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are weird rival reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't talk to each other and,
uh, I'd rather just not be friends with
[SPEAKER_00]: some people, but I don't got no bickering,
no hate or no nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk shit about anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk shit about anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have hatred for any other breeder
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't like me, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the beef is over in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking too old for that dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not high school is what I think I'm
getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm done with all the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got nothing but love and respect
coming from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I do grow out their stuff because
we're all what, like that's where seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I keep growing all of my stuff,
I'm just going to be growing my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to introduce other things into
the garden or I bottleneck my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where else is other stuff going to come
from other breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I do breed and grow and test run
other breeder stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm fucking amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I paid money for this shit and
other people are paying money for this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a fucking, the whole
threat of hate speech on the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: internet about this person after paying
good money for these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go and bash anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to say that fucking anything I
say, if I were to say that seed company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't want to make up numbers
because there's probably a seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: called that right now, the fucking Mac
book seed company sold me seeds and they
[SPEAKER_00]: sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't do me any good to go online
and say Mac book seed company sold me
[SPEAKER_00]: herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just looks like I'm trying to big up
my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no need to bash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do get a keeper, when I do get a
champion, I'm not afraid to share that
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, recently I grew the Jack, the ripper
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Jack, the ripper seeds,
uh, shout out to sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all of the, uh, team TGA team
green Avengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, shout out to the people keeping the
name alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I grew some sub cool stuff because
sub cool was one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, it's weird as a 40 year old guy
to talk about your heroes, but without sub
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and TGA genetics, I wouldn't be Irene
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff would just be some random
fucking basement grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably you would have never heard of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a struggling ass musician or a fake
comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a standup comic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, without sub cool and TGA,
I wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when sub cool passed away, rest in
peace, subby, big respect, nothing but
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when sub passed away, it was my duty
to make some crosses in honor of sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought the, uh, I didn't buy,
I was given, honestly, I was gifted some
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack, the ripper seeds from a member of
TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the person who gave those to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they don't need any controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to start all the emails,
but I got some TGA seeds from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found my keepers and I bred to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that's a prime example of growing,
uh, people would consider TGA a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitor, but that was a friend,
a colleague, a partner, um, a teammate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in the green team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want the same for the customer,
the client, the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you guys to get a successful seed,
grow a successful plant, have a happy
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, a successful outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I know you're asking if I grow out
competitor seeds and I'm focusing more on
[SPEAKER_00]: the word competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mr. Soul said at one time,
like, we're all musicians and we're all in
[SPEAKER_00]: different bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, uh, you like reggae,
maybe you like country music, maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: like fucking pop hits from the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're into fucking Norwegian death
metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a breeder out there that offers
something for you that you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, every breeder just develops their
own following.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get their own click, their own niche,
their own certain type of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about the vibe that they
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, I do love to grow other
seeds from other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not for calling bullshit or QC
standards, just because I like to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see like what they've got to
offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a breeder say, Hey, I've got this
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Oh, I've been watching you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know those two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of curious what that's going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll buy a pack and run it just for fun,
just to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll buy a pack and give it to a
friend and let them run it just to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does because I'm that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionately curious, especially when
it comes to cannabis, but also I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bunch of rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got a friend with some open
space, you know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out for running seedlings for me and
finding us some keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just throw seedlings to other people
and they run shit for me to find us stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go visit and check out what
they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I help them pick keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we disagree, which means I
get one keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the other cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take one home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both got what we wanted, but we got two
different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got growing stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling on that part, but yeah,
bro, I love growing other seed breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I find stuff for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm growing the, uh, chem daily chem
right now, which is chem D to I 95 from,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, geez, uh, that one's from JJ from top
dog, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez, I almost forgot who that shit was
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking get lost, but I'm growing that
one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from seed and it is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been bred too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's where that came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about everything I've got came from a
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually all plants came from a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the platinum tangy that I grow,
that was a seed from garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they, somebody else found that,
but I mean, that came from garden of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and the strawberry starburst are the
strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to make strawberry starburst was a
seed that started off as a Crockett seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired the cloner to commercial grow,
but in the long run, they're all seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all started from a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling like a motherfucker on that
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the answer is yes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do grow other people's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start my seeds and their seeds
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare germ rates, compare growth rates,
just see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of reasons to do them
mainly because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I get some new shit to
breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next email I've got is going to take
way too long for this show.
