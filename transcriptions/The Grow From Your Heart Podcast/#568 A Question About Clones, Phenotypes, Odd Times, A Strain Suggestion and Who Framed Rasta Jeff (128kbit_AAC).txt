[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff and it's time for episode 568 of the

[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of Fortissimo full
spectrum extract from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of crescendo and HSB.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HSB is Han Solo burger on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as 98 octane
dumpster and funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crack this open, it smells like a
hot bar trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound like a pleasant
description, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some hot bar trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the other one in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: 98 octane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the specific octane,
but I definitely get a funky gassy feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the description of 98 octane dumpster
and funk is completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a garlicky dumpster fire
and I fucking love it on the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it contains 64.93% THC and
non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show it to the camera there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice chunky diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough Terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at green dot
labs for the tremendous Fortissimo full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
clone cutters and Paul and Chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of messages from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the message portion of
the show, let's do some shout outs to a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of the folks who support the show on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it easy for my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, really thank you for all of the
continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be updating those Patreon tiers
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a few more options, make it a little
bit easier for you guys to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on on that page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that I will make some
adjustments, but anyway, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shout out to the Fortissimo for
getting me rambly at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously nice and chattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the Patreon
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, before we get there,
I've got an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost skipped a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says update right here on my page.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I spoke about
grafting and I said that I believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: when we do grafting, and I said I have no
science behind this, I said I've got no
[SPEAKER_00]: actual experience in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this was my belief and my
assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that if we graft two plants
together, eventually over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: those genetics will intermingle or meld or
shift somehow to where that is one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the genetics will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcome, the flowers, the fruits of
that plant will be different over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people disagreed with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people said that that was not a
thing, that the genetics will stay true to
[SPEAKER_00]: each branch of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you carefully label it, you'll know
what it is forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had another listener actually tag
me in an article and send me a link to an
[SPEAKER_00]: article where it showed evidence of a
plant changing its genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant used was a tobacco plant,
but it did show that some genes did move
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my buddy Big Huff for
tagging me in an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pointing out the fact that I may have
been correct the first time in my
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption and believing that if you graft
a plant over time, eventually those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics could and possibly will mingle or
meld or whatever the scientific word is
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am being honest and open that I do not
have the scientific education or
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology for this scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my grower knowledge mind,
I feel like those genetics would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut off, if I cut off your arm,
if we traded arms, cut off, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go with, we're going to do left leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, if I had to lose a limb,
I would choose my left leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a drummer thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut off our left legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get my left leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get your left leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to walk funny because I'm six,
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got long ass legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't have legs as long as
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to walk funny over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your leg and my leg, which is we've
traded, I don't know what to call these
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, but our new legs are going to
adapt and adjust to our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be your leg anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be my leg anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may still have your genes in it and my
genes in it, but it's going to become
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be part of my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 20 years from now, if we're still
alive, we won't even, we'll still know
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've got a leg transplant because
it's fucking one's way longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our bodies will go, that's my leg now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be completely adjusted to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our genetics will have melded in and
meshed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll forget that that's somebody else's
leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body will go, that's my leg now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're the only function just like
your leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take me too seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you gave me a new arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those genetics that make it cherry
Cush and those genetics that make it
[SPEAKER_00]: purple haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will, you'll somehow you're not
breeding, but you're going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry haze sort of a thing out of that on
accident in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody has posted an article that
says that did happen with different
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals of tobacco plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first assumption and belief has been
shown to have been accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that stirred up more controversy
because I look forward to hearing your
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback and your input on that update.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I said that I feel like grafting
will cause genetics to move, I may have
[SPEAKER_00]: been right in my original assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the short answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short version of that long ramble now
is the part when we're going to jump into
[SPEAKER_00]: the Patreon messages on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, at this time, this is not
another false start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually going to get into the
Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one comes from our friend tree
star Meadow, who may have for may have
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I forgot who he was, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not forget who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing but love and support and
respect for you and appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta, Jeff tree star Meadow
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the guy who framed the orange gasm for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an amazing gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke briefly about it here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend tree star sent me a beautiful
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of artwork going on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inside of that frame is a framed
package of orange gasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that that orange gasm made his
life easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thanked me for making my life
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has no idea that the orange gasm has
made my life easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made my life better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been my number one seller lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been paying the bill, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been my hit song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been the one making my company soar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big thanks and big respect and big
appreciation for the gift of the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: gasm framed package.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I was listening to your
podcast today and I felt it was high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got on Patreon and became a supporter of
you and also the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend tree star signed up to support
myself and the DGC on Patreon today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming from the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They appreciate it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say it goes without saying
you've been a tremendous help in making me
[SPEAKER_00]: a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only right that I support you
financially after all you've done for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend my weekdays alone, building and
shipping squares and rectangles from a
[SPEAKER_00]: small industrial warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the voices of Rasta Jeff,
Scotty Guru and the dude that keep me
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love knowing that I'm keeping you
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I have a good hint at what you
do all day because you sent me a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm glad that we were able to keep
you sane because that type of a job would
[SPEAKER_00]: drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some sort of variation,
some sort of chaos in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that we're able to keep you
sane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for noticing that you've
gotten a vast education from me and made
[SPEAKER_00]: you a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that I made you a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love financial support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes life better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just knowing that somebody out there
is enjoying their garden more,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a more successful outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the show was about in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should keep moving because I am fucking
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, even though we've never met,
I feel like a hangout with you guys all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to learn and laugh concurrently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it is worth my $10 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a lot of podcasts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite podcasts, maybe
possibly one of my, it's one of my top
[SPEAKER_00]: five favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of my favorite podcasts actually
have been disrupted lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Church of What's Happening Now with
Joey Diaz is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey Diaz has moved back to New Jersey
because there's no point in being in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have his producer anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would listen to Uncle Joey on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot like you guys listen to me and I
felt like I'm friends with Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked some concentrates with Joey
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around Joey, hung out with Joey,
but it was like keeping up with my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: every day via that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that podcast ended, I miss Uncle
Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting part of my entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A part of my life is missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID didn't really hit me too hard until
all of my entertainment started going
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I know Uncle Joey and I
feel like I miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand exactly where you're
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other podcast that disappeared on me
is the fighter and the kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a T-Fat K fan, you understand
what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss seeing that old gay owl on the
other couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a T-Fat K fan, you
understand exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss Callan on that red couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the other guys on the red couches
just doesn't do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss my bro Callan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand exactly what you mean
about hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consume a lot of podcasts, so I feel the
exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually, since I hit a certain tier
on my Patreon, I have gone and started
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to other podcasts that I
enjoy because I felt that it was time to
[SPEAKER_00]: give back the karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for throwing me 10 bucks and
throwing the Dude Grows crew 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually contributed to Mike's Patreon
because Mike comes on my show and helps me
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured it was my responsibility to
contribute to White Mike's Patreon and say
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I contributed to Joey Diaz,
of course, and the fighter and the kid,
[SPEAKER_00]: or not the fighter and the kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rejected my fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I revoked it because I didn't like what
they gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the King of the Sting, they get a
couple bucks from me, but I did go do some
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions because you guys are hooking
me up so fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track here, at least a
little tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm glad you loved your frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure you received the
note was included with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The note meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole package was beautiful and meant
a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that my mom was going to be showing
up in my house later that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left the framed package and the note
laying on the table where I knew she would
[SPEAKER_00]: walk by and just curiously pick it up and
read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was left out there inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't invading space or anything by
reading that I left it there to be read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she told me later, she's like,
whoever wrote that is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really sweet thing for someone to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she even felt like the look on her
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see the sincerity that she felt
your note.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt every word of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't realize exactly how many
lives I've touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your thank you note did go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm building a new office space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying that for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed some plants to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my office was a grow room for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things that breeders do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to rebuild the office space and
that will definitely go in a spot where I
[SPEAKER_00]: look frequently because I want to see that
and be reminded of that quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get its own dedicated little
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off to take a fat dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we're able to travel,
I'll give my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They signed it with their real name and
then tree star Meadow, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that package that you
sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will always mean a lot to me while
you're off traveling and giving your mom a
[SPEAKER_00]: hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you come take a dab with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could travel, we could do some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come take a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting you tree star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get way off track in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this choo choo train on the
rails just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great Patreon question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a series of questions that
comes from our friend Wyatt herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I took your
Patreon advice on your podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sending you a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to check that my $7 and 10 cent
level is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I would be included in the shout
outs, I love your show brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best podcast by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first message from Wyatt
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did receive your contribution and the $7
and 10 cent level is exactly what you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Wyatt herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you did get a shout out at the
start of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't, it's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write them down at the start of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to do about 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did get a shout out at the start of
this one, try to give about nine to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: shout outs, depending on how long your
names are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the shout outs fall into
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to throw down 10, $7 and 10 cents
on the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I write down 10 or 12 of them at
the start of each episode to throw out
[SPEAKER_00]: your Patreon did make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's showing too many people's names
reading through the paper up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but your Patreon message did make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do get a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, shout out to Wyatt herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes also a request and a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind good, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you watched that Danny carry drum
video?
[SPEAKER_00]: Numa asked you on your Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you weren't a big tool fan,
but every time you talk about drums,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about how you must watch the solo
at six minutes and 30 seconds in is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time signature is nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four counts ain't happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, watch it for the craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is cannabis related content in this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I am a huge musician, a huge music
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing the drum since I was 14
or 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how old I am by now,
I've been playing for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can count odd times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get a good feel for shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people sent me that exact
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That video must've gotten popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must've been trending or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the same day that I said something
about the drums because three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: people sent me that video within a three
or four day time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also somebody that means a lot to me as a
huge tool fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I thought it would be time to give
that song a listen and learn it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the idea of this song,
but I don't have all of the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: memorized and comfortably figured out,
but I know I can count it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the time signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just comfortably flowing with that is
going to take me a minute, but I can do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I'll be able to play the whole
thing all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't be a too big of a deal in a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be knocking that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a year, but it's only gonna
take me a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just get to play a little bit and
practice on that just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, it's a fun song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys, this is not cannabis
related, but it was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so many people sent me that,
that video all like within a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is a sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you asked me, Hey, have you tried
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm going to go fucking
try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I listened to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down the exact date of the first
time I attempted to play it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got that written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the 4th of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that means by, I don't know,
six months from now, I should have some
[SPEAKER_00]: solid progress on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like a long time,
but it is a monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a monster of a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of fun or to be a
lot of exercise as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, four accounts ain't happening about
drum solo in the middle is all four,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a camouflaged for the different
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of it is five and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, one, two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five with a couple of one twos right in
the middle of there to fuck up the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do have questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what are the options for us deep in
prohibition land to buy legit clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always wanted to grow a real deal
cut, but I have no idea who to trust or if
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff online is credible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in, I'm not even going to say your
state because I don't want to give any
[SPEAKER_00]: hints of where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, since you're talking about being in
prohibition land, I'm in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the local scene is basically
non-existent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can try the trade game,
but I'm not extremely handy in forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't hear much about the online
clone sales at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the clone game can be a risky game.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only, if you don't know other growers,
if there's not a growing community in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, if you don't know anybody,
you're going to have to rely on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to rely on forums or
social media or something that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost guarantee you, you're going
to get spider mites, powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, uh, some sort of fungus gnats or
some sort of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those always come free with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just part of doing business when it
comes to getting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't recommend, if you don't have a
trusted reliable source, I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend doing it unless you're really
desperate and hardworking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend doing it unless you're
really desperate and hardworking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't look like a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be a good seller, but you've got
to trust the seller and the sender.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is going to end up coming to
you in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they label it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So where it doesn't look like it's a
fucking clone, did they package it safely
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it doesn't look like it's a
clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to set yourself up to get
in trouble from somebody, you don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know who's careless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of vet people, uh,
learn how they do business, see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: how they do one thing is how they do all
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're sloppy in one aspect,
they're going to be sloppy when they send
[SPEAKER_00]: you shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do business with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can put you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else to say for,
damn, I stuttered hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even going to edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else to tell you or to
say when it comes to getting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, the forums and shit are
going to be your best bet, but who knows
[SPEAKER_00]: if those people are even going to send you
what you ask for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for somebody to fake you
and say they've got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good way to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know you're looking for granddaddy
purple clones, I've got granddaddy purple
[SPEAKER_00]: clones suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for lemon haze clones,
I know I've got lemon haze clones
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how some people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful when it comes to clone
shopping online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have much advice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say find some grower friends and
trade cuts directly with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get those cuts, put them into
quarantine, treat them like they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them for about two weeks in another
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can treat them every third day with
different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe combinations of pesticides,
pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them with the fungicide,
get rid of all the problems that they
[SPEAKER_00]: could come with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, clones come with free
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat them for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of better advice while
I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want real deal cuts, I think the
best way to do it is to shop for S1 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cuts that you're hot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically why I made golden goat
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat was a really popular cut when
I started kind of coming up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding game and making seeds to give out
in bulk quantities to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat was the big hot shit in my
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reversed the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intention was I can't send clones out
to everybody, but I can get seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get S1 seeds, that is as close
as you're going to get to getting a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: of a certain cultivar without running the
risk of having a clone mailed to you
[SPEAKER_00]: without that clone not being what you're
told it is without getting the bugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that come with the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think seeds are going to be the
closest option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, S1 seeds are self seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you take a cultivar,
you treat it with a solution, take the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from that plant and put it on
another clone of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've used two girl plants, you treated
one with some magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are going to make feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got S1 feminized seeds,
no adulteration of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be as close as you can find
to that strain without getting a dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: clone or without out crossing it or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have good advice on getting
legit clones, buying legit clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to buy stuff like that
online, be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to trust the seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to trust the shipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put yourself in a lot of positions
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the clone, is it
contaminated, infected, infested,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is it even indeed what you are told
it's labeled as?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you get some feminized
S1 seeds from a reliable breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a reliable seed seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I do recommend seedsherenow.com
and use coupon code GFYH10 while you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some blueberry cookies,
S1s, I've made those available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want golden goat, feminized seeds,
the S1s are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both available at seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can help you find some S1s,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep sitting on this big dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see me keep in, keep reaching
behind me, trying to get this dread out
[SPEAKER_00]: from under me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's driving me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of your worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, uh, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving my iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four of your strains in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and I couldn't be happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know which four you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to see photos of those
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running four strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know which four you've got
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you couldn't be happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My product is making you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, here's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think I could get a blue raspberry
truffle Fino from a bebop seed since they
[SPEAKER_00]: have the two strain combos and he means
the two same parents, or will the sex of
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents limit what traits they can
express?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the story here is blue raspberry
truffle is an arise to blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an arise male pollinated a blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bebop is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed blueberry cookies to make
pollen and pollinated my female arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to find vast differences
because the male was completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female arise and the male arise are
different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was using, if they were both reversed
and done that way, you'd find more common
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes and you'd be more likely to
find the blue raspberry truffle in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I used the female arise that
kind of takes away from the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the blue raspberry, you'll still find
it, but it's not the same male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different plant in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the female, which will carry
different traits, but it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a possibility because you've still
got those two flavors in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also you're going to see more of the
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you're going to find the
more of the male kind of carries the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and the shape a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you're going to see
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see more of the blueberry
cookie shape and less of the arise shape
[SPEAKER_00]: in that plant is what I think you're going
to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible, but since I used the
arise number four female and not the King
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon male, you're going to see
differences because those are two
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from the same line, the same
progeny, but they're, they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they were selected for different
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible, uh, with the two strain
combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you'd be, if you want the blue
raspberry truffle, you'd be better off
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyatt herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the end of your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more message to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if anybody else out there would
like to join the Patreon and get your
[SPEAKER_00]: question moved up to the top, it is
patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I will answer your questions via
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Patreon is the way to move your
message right up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from a long time Patreon
supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Mr. Glenn Gironi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, Jeff, you can obviously use
my name if this makes it to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good because when I hold up the
message, your name shows up real big
[SPEAKER_00]: through the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to Glenn Gironi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as I approached the first two rooms of
my commercial grow coming to the final
[SPEAKER_00]: date, I'm wondering whether or not to
flush with pHed RO water or just regular
[SPEAKER_00]: RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I add my newts and my pH is right
on the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I would prefer not to add pH down
to water if it is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO is what we have to use due to small
amounts of aluminum of aluminum in the
[SPEAKER_00]: well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend Glenn Gironi is coming up on
their, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, the first two rooms of their
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on the first harvest in
your commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's wondering if he should flush with
pHed or not pHed RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's using reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he says without adjusting the pH,
it comes out at 6.9 to 7.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just about neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's wondering if he should adjust the pH
to 5.9 to 6.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally he adds newts and the pH is right
on the money at 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now he doesn't want to add pH down
to the water if it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, wants to know if it will be okay to
flush with the current RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're flushing, we are basically
trying to rinse out the medium that is
[SPEAKER_00]: holding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to get the soil, the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to rinse that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing left for the plant to
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using RO water, RO water will
stop the plant from uptaking more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the water is pHed, it is able to
uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is at the wrong pH, it can't uptake
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to eat anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't find a reason to pH the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to make that plant
cannibalize itself and stop eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically just want to get water
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water on your normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I want to clear up as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, when we're flushing, feed,
uh, clean water for two weeks until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean water every day for two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure Glenn Geroni is smart enough
here for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for some people that were confused
when they were listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is water on your normal
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to harvest in 14 days
today, water tells you that you're going
to harvest in 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to harvest in 14 days until
you get about 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for that plant to dry until it's
thirsty again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then water until you get 20% runoff with
just clean, plain water that will flush
[SPEAKER_00]: out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not mean fucking drown the plant
every day until it's running off 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't get time to flush it four days
into the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to blame it on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it heavily till you get 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even a little extra dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get three, five times of that,
depending on how often you water your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get three to five good fucking
flushes out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will make your plants burn well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that can go into a
flushing conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to flush out?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff you're trying to flush
out has actually been turned into buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you actually flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't remove the stuff from the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning, still reading,
still digging into that controversy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we just want to clean the soil so the
plants will quit eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that not adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants aren't going to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to drink still.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get water, but they're
not going to uptake any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't find it necessary to adjust the
pH of the water at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make it a lot easier in
your commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to save you a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to save you money on a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't have to put the pen in there
and stir it around and try to get it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question says, what feminized
genetics does irie genetics offer that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend for a commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can create whatever environment each
particular cultivar needs with no
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wanting quality first and quantity
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'll get both with the strain I'm
going to recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so what do you suggest I run of yours
in my commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I'm going to strongly
recommend orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gasum orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gasum is the fucking winner in a
commercial grow for feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts out good fat harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take super long to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got mad bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like delicious oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates just smell like fucking
orange candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll suck up a lot of nutrients though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to feed the shit out of it,
but it can take abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take all kinds of rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room is too hot, too cold,
too humid, too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heavily strongly, highly recommend
orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gasum from my feminine feminize lineup for
your commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so then it also says there are picks
up attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said not to brag, but I am fucking
killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were killing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw your photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will testify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come so far in four years and a large
amount of my personal development has been
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired by your episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am seeing a trend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are telling me lately that
they are becoming better growers because
[SPEAKER_00]: of my episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing the show for about six
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means people have been listening for
four to six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's been listening for four years
or at least growing for four years and is
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing personal development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys inspire me to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be a better grower, a better
speaker, a better podcaster, because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a bigger audience, a better show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to stay on top of my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always got to be the sensei,
but I'm still learning all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys inspire me to have personal
development as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that perfect dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I prefer to learn more from
someone else's mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what you're providing to
growers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homie from Glenn Jerome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about all the success I've
had, there are a lot of failures that came
[SPEAKER_00]: with that success, but it's how you deal
with those failures that make you
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fall off that horse nine times,
you get on that horse nine fucking times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10th time you won't fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably fallen down 15 times and
gotten up fucking 15 times you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how it goes.
