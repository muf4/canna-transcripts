[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and it's time for episode 591 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this show off by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Bounce
Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Headbanger and Secret
Kush Mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
sour, gas, and pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this concentrate on the
podcast before, I'm a big fan of the sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy, pine flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think those flavors and aromas are
always accompanied by a really nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 68.17% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the Bounce Live
Batter.

iregenetics, all things Rasta Jeff at
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show where we work
our way into Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I talked about
changing our timer for daylight savings
[SPEAKER_00]: time and I asked for feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of great messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose three of them for today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, when it comes to
daylight savings time, I personally change
[SPEAKER_00]: my life and my schedule and continue on
with the regular 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once my flowering plants have
finished, I changed the cycle back to my
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, I would change the timer and
the night hour hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would extend the dark period for one
hour that day or night before to
[SPEAKER_00]: compensate for daylight savings time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it just feels better for me to allow
them to continue as scheduled and change
[SPEAKER_00]: my routine for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is probably the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say the last thing these
plants need is more stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans care about daylight savings time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants most likely think it is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is a human construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is an invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is imaginary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that, but then think about
payday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't pay you for your time,
you're going to be bitchy about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But time is imaginary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't care what the clock says.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are worried about did the sun
come up and did the sun go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they know what time it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all they are worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing they need is more stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we did invent time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a human construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants probably think that daylight
savings time is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say a special thank you shout
out to our buddy J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening and thank you for
sending me an update about your daylight
[SPEAKER_00]: savings time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got another message right in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from our friend Michael S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says I just let it ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up my light cycle with daylight
savings time in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a person that is planning and
thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says even with the hour time change,
I can still get in there before I leave in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning before the lights go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's back on when I get home from
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said that the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get in there and work on them
before you leave for work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's back on when you get home from
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, are you gone for 12 hours at work?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be growing at work also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Michael S.
[SPEAKER_00]: for also adjusting to the plants and
keeping the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a theme happening here in these
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from El Herbalife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a trend here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three out of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people adjust their lives to the
schedule of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't adjust their plants to the
schedule of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of shows the passion in these
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I admit that I forgot about
daylight savings time, but I changed my
[SPEAKER_00]: damn alarm to wake up an hour earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great podcast, great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the positive vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it ire brother from El Herbalogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lerbalogue, El Herbalogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will keep up the positive vibe and
the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will for sure keep it ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to our buddy Herbalogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big shout out to everybody who sent me
a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I only read three of them on
today's podcast, but I saw a theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is adjusting their life to the
plants, not adjusting the plants to their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shows some dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some commitment to our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way into some fresh content
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question that comes from our
friend Flavor Maker, a longtime listener,
[SPEAKER_00]: a longtime supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Flavor Maker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question goes, I've got a grow
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an LED, I've got a T5 LED two bar
sun blaze light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a, it's an LED T5 light,
which sounds like it's a combo light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an LED, a T5 LED bulb in a sun blaze
two bar fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two of these LED T5 bulbs and
a sun blaze fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of words for just one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, in germination week one
to two, how high overhead do people
[SPEAKER_00]: average?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here is how high above the
plants in weeks one and two would I hang
[SPEAKER_00]: my T5 LED two bar sun blaze light?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, are bleaching and burning issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be recovery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I alter the outcome by stressing them
at birth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I definitely see variations
among three different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel embarrassed asking this,
but we all get better on micro topics like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never be embarrassed to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably made the mistake that I can
prevent you from making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably seen somebody make the
mistake that you're about to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never be afraid to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stupidest question is the one you
didn't ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that mistake you made was a
stupid mistake because you didn't ask the
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dabs are working you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I learned the smallest changes
can have huge adverse outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something you do today, you're not
going to see the outcome for seven to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't get to actually see the
real outcome for maybe nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, small things do have huge
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says from soil density, light and
environmental, all things have a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, feel free to share or just help
with the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm doing both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share and I'm going to help
you with your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know much about the T5 LED
sunblaze lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had to do some research on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I read and everything that
makes sense to me says to keep that light
[SPEAKER_00]: between 12 and 24 inches above your
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things said 18 inches is
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things said 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some said go as high as 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between 12 and 24 seems ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 18 inches makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do, put your light 18 to 24
inches above your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing that's about here from the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 or 24 inches above the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want this, so give yourself a couple
inches for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to raise that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, 18 to 24 inches above the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the plant look like it wants more
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it lifting up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves go up, if they're praying,
it may want more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves start curling, and going
down, it may be getting too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves get droopy, it has had
enough light and it wants a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably raise that light up and
give it a little bit less PPFD,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit less U-moles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't be a bad idea for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing you have to do is watch the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that light above the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch how the plant responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your hand right above the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just touch the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave your hand there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel like your hand is getting a
burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel uncomfortable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel like a sunburn?
[SPEAKER_00]: If your hand doesn't want to stay there,
either does the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can leave your hand there and be
like, yeah, that's fine, the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to watch the plant though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, that plant may say,
hey, I've had enough of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to raise that light or turn
it down, or I'm going to react to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing it will do, the leaves
will start to claw down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of being nice and turgid and they
have that almost a taco, almost a canoe
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're just right, they'll start to
droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you give them too much light,
they'll droop even.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll claw a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you give them too much light,
they'll droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll claw down and then they will
droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is saying, hey, I've had way too much
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most obvious signs you may see
is leaf twisting, but that is a sign of
[SPEAKER_00]: way too much light, way too intense,
which I don't think you'll get from these
[SPEAKER_00]: little two bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice to you is to start about 24
inches above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly raise it down to about 18 inches
and pay attention to the plants as they
[SPEAKER_00]: get bigger, as they get more stout,
they'll be able to photosynthesize more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll want and they'll be able to take
more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lower that light down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go past 12 inches from everything I
read because that is when you will
[SPEAKER_00]: experience the next thing you talked
about, burning and bleaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: These LED lights do have the potential to
burn and bleach our plants if we get them
[SPEAKER_00]: too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that 12 inch distance at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus a little bit higher while the plants
are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that will keep you safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I have not used these
specific lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I talk about on the show is
firsthand experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to research this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you secondhand advice using
logic and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got for you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says anyway, oh, I think I wrapped it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use this or just help with
the questions above.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 to 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start about 24, work it down to
18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go closer than those 12 inches
because on my research, that is where we
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting the burning, the bleaching,
and the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor Maker, I want to thank you for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how your plants are looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a follow-up, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how high above that canopy
you've got the plants and how it's working
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are responding negatively,
raise or lower that fucking light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant could be an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love gauges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all that stuff, but the main thing
about this is watching the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a relationship with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you're going to make a
relationship work is by watching the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a relationship with and
adjusting to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can message me and say, Hey,
what would I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could give you advice and tell you
what to do, but you have to watch how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant responds to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm wrong, I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant may want something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meters may say, put it, when you get a
meter, when you get equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're always recommended ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the growers, myself, the podcast,
the internet, we've all got recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant may say, fuck your recommended
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a pH of nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's not ever going to want a pH of
nine, but maybe there's one plant out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that thrives, one cannabis plant
that wants that pH of nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what the meters say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what the internet says?
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant wants something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a weird dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to eat and drink random shit that
most people probably wouldn't enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drink a gang of kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people would say, I don't want that
much kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe your plants are weirdos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're anomalies just like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got to feed them a little bit
differently, adjust them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rambled long enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a new email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, yo Rasta Jeff, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you mentioned at one time to
increase the lights on time toward the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increase the lights on time is how I
should have read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase the lights on time toward the end
of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind me asking, could you
please give me another rundown on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the last stages of flowering and I
want to try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for all of your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm such a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're a better grower from
listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you took my advice and you
actually used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're improving and I'm glad
you're seeing improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm growing a rise for the third
run and I look forward to purchasing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been smoking for eight months
now because I've been on probation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see pictures of your arise and I
can't wait to smoke with you when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: off of probation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that's about to end now and I'll
be able to smoke all of the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I'm excited for that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Regay in my
head and he signed it with love and
[SPEAKER_00]: respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about this, but let me
read another one because I had two people
[SPEAKER_00]: send me basically the same question and
I'm going to cover the one answer with
[SPEAKER_00]: both of these emails with one answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, thanks for the grow
knowledge and the positive vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting week eight of flower in
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tracks are starting to become cloudy
on the do grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned flipping back to 18 six
from 1212 during the last week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it will increase Terps smell and
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they list a little bit about their
gross setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been, I have a weaker light
and it seems I'm about a week behind on
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering compared to the recommended
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a breeder recommends eight weeks,
they always mean nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight weeks is a good selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always expect nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say the trikes are telling
me they have about a week to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought about going to the 18 six
light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also plan to revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I wanted to add this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I also wanted to revedge a few
smaller plant branches and take clones
[SPEAKER_00]: after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the 18 six schedule have a negative
effect on the clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, peace, love and good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their names
said, but shout out to our friend Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two messages about basically the
same thing with a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say turn the timer back on to 18
six at the end of flower, that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: completely absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had these plants on 1212 for eight
or nine weeks at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saying turn the timer back to 18
hours on and six hours off for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: seven to 10 days of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why would I want to do that to our
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about what makes our plants
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes our plants grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing that makes our plants
happen, the main source of energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that photon energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use that light for life energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think by turning the lights on for
the last seven to 10 days of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: we give them more light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the plants beef up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get bulkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of ripen up a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I think the harvest weight is
heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving them more light hours per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving them six more hours per day
for seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to 60 more hours of light time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of growth at the end of the
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the plants we grow bulk up right
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say don't cut these too early because
that lasts two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks is when it really packs on the
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we turn that light cycle on to 18.6
during that same bulking period,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get a lot of light energy and they're
able to beef up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are going to say, aren't they
going to, something's going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to revedge or they're going
to start to have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not because in seven to 10
days, we're going to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start flushing the same
time that we do this light change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start flushing, change the light back to
18.6 and pay close attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and pay attention to the top
buds of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you see new nubby weird growth
coming out of their harvest, that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: first sign of revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to cut that plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't see that for 12 to 14
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will take 16, 17 days to show
you any signs of revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that last seven,
10, 14 days, throw it on 18.6 and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will really beef up at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the part about Terps, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: The part about Terps and what else does it
increase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that comes with the 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not why I do, or that's not why I
do the 18-6, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I do the 18-6 is for denser
buds, bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically makes them beef up and they
also ripen up more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting more white, they just
ripen more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it has anything to do with
aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Terps in aroma and flavor can be
increased by harvesting after a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have an extremely long
dark period, but if you do a 12-hour dark
[SPEAKER_00]: period, a lot of people like to throw the
plants in a 24-hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you can develop more Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daylight, the sun, the light,
our bright lights, they break down the
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants produce more Terpings in the
dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can catch them right before they
start photosynthesizing, that is when the
[SPEAKER_00]: most Terps are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the idea behind cutting them
down in the dark after an extended dark
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the Terps come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you may have crossed two
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, that is what I think you got that
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 18-6 is more for density, more for
faster ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I do fully encourage, and that is
a trick that I kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known that for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us in the growing industry have
known that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just keep it under our belts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't talk a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, it's a trick that I can use
to speed up rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get more breeding projects going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, the last 7 to 10, maybe 14 days,
you can turn your light timer back on for
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 hours on and 6 hours off, and it will
increase the performance of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a better harvest weight,
you'll get denser buds, and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: ripen up a little bit more quickly under
that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should be flushing at that time
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they do show you any signs of reveg
too early, chop them down immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there was another part to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said I want to reveg a few smaller
branches and take clones after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the 18-6 schedule have a negative
effect on the clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the 18-6 schedule will have a
wonderful effect on your reveg and your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving yourself a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, people harvest their
plants, and they leave a couple of buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they say, now I'm going to reveg
these buds, and they put it back under 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours or 18-6 of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already 10 days ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant has been under 18-6 of light
for 7, 10, maybe 14 days before you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested most of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you took off the big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just left a couple of little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave like 3 or 4, maybe 5 thumb-sized
buds at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need to reveg, and they're
already having a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already 7 to 10, 14 days into the
reveg process.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we reveg is just by turning the lights
back on to a vegetative cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: patiently waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've already started that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about time to cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll harvest almost everything,
like I said before, leave 3 to 5 little
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb-sized nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to start feeding a
high-nitrogen diet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to your vegetative diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll trigger those plants to go back
into the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start spitting out weird
dill-looking leaves, like leaves like a
[SPEAKER_00]: dill plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really strange-looking
leaves for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be claw-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have variegations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one day, it'll spit out a new shoot
that looks like just a fucking baby clone
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel like you've been blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look at it, and you'll go,
ah, it's got this brand-new shoot coming
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe wait for two or three of those to
happen, and clone those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a clone out of that shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that shoot root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that shoot is rooted, pot it,
grow it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take clones from that plant and use that
one as your clone donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now work with those new clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kind of grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let all those hormones get kind of
realigned before we start running that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut a clone of it, grow out that clone,
then use that clone as your new clone
[SPEAKER_00]: donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may slow you down a little bit,
but in my opinion, that's the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve the genetics, keep them healthy,
and not experience any sort of loss or
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation or the words that we don't use
because they're not real anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full podcast episode on the
word that I'm not going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you both.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is starting to skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, thank you for being
patient with me while I hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank my buddy Zach and my buddy
Regay in my head, both for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do encourage that 18.6 at the end
of flower that will bulk up and beef up
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop, and it will set you on the path
for success for revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing that we would do in a
revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just cutting down part of the plant
when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the rest of it there to grow for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in a couple of weeks, you'll have
fresh shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks from there, you'll have brand
new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to thank you guys both
for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to some sort of an update
from both of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this work for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice a fatter harvest weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice a denser bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice that things finished up a
little bit more quickly for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you.
