[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 839 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got another great episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds, hang out with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do once again want to cordially invite
you to join us at the Dude Grows Growers
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: June 1st in La Porte, Colorado,
the Dude Grows crew is hosting the Dude
[SPEAKER_01]: Grows Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire DGC crew will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Airy Army will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all look forward to meeting you at
the Dude Grows Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check dgccup.com for all of
the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: As this episode comes out, that event is
only two weeks away, so it is very close
[SPEAKER_01]: to being sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you get those tickets today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you show up to the Dude Grows Cup
wearing an Airy Genetics or Airy Army
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt, hoodie or hat, I will give you a
free gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you stop by the booth and say
hello and pick up that free gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you're not wearing any Airy gear,
Airy merch, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please come to the booth and say hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to meet me, shake my hand,
say hello, share pictures of your grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: share some flowers that you grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to meet all of my friends at
the Dude Grows Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop by the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have a big booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop by and say hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to meeting everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes my booth will be very busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a lot of people in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stand in that line for a couple of minutes
or simply come back when there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd and introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never too busy to shake hands,
to meet the Airy Army, to meet the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm there for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't message me the day after or the week
after saying, hey, bro, I saw you at the
[SPEAKER_01]: DGC Cup, wanted to say hi, but you looked
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am never too busy to shake your hand,
give you a fist bump, give you a hug,
[SPEAKER_01]: take a picture, smell your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop by, introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said a moment ago, there may be a
line, it may be busy, but if I see
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody standing there and they're
starting to look anxious, like they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to meet me, like they want to talk to me,
I do pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do try to speed up the line and try to
get people coming and going so I can meet
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel like you're bothering me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be more upset if you do not
introduce yourself and tell me later that
[SPEAKER_01]: you chickened out, that you were too shy
than I would be if you just walk up,
[SPEAKER_01]: interrupt people, be awkward, come say
hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meet me, shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm there for, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to meet everybody in the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we will have a bunch of great
merchandise at the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop by the booth, see what we've got,
check out the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a lot of the classic things
and there will be some surprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that is the dude Groves crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next piece of advertising I've got
before we jump into the question,
[SPEAKER_01]: answer portion of the show is there is
currently a sale happening on iredirect
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the entire month of May, I will be
blowing out regular seed packs on
[SPEAKER_01]: iredirect.com for ridiculous pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a 10 pack of Lightripper
regular seeds for $10 right now at
[SPEAKER_01]: iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great steals and deals
on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: For current pricing and inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that is all of the advertising
for the start of the show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work our way into the pet peeve
portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure most of you understand what a pet
peeve is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pet peeve is something that just simply
drives you crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to focus on grow room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I see in a grow room,
whether it's a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a private grow, maybe I saw
it online or perhaps it could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community pet peeve, something
that just simply simply drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been encouraging you, the listeners
and viewers, to send in your pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can email me at growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply put the word pet peeve in the
subject line so I can find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do read your pet peeve here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds off of iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's pet peeve came from my friend
Patio Toker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy, Patio Toker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been around for quite a while,
so it's great to get an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: send you a coupon code for free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patio Toker's pet peeve says, my pet peeve
is undefoliated plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking plants that have never been
touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that is a very valid pet peeve,
and what he means is defoliation is when
[SPEAKER_01]: you go in and take off some of the larger
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost demand it be done in a commercial
grow environment when there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: foliage, a lot of leaf happening in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that taking off those leaves can
mitigate a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Patio Toker's big pet peeve is that he
does not like plants that have not been
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That big 70s bush of a plant with all
those leaves growing in there simply
[SPEAKER_01]: drives you crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, let me tell you a little bit of a
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently ran a grow room, and in that
grow I was struggling to keep the humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not going to buy a humidifier for
one grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a short grow process at a weird
part of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had switched equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had switched the way that I was running
my ducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was struggling to keep the humidity
right in this grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: My smart idea was to defoliate less than I
usually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left the leaves on those plants to allow
them to transpire and put moisture into
[SPEAKER_01]: the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those leaves were releasing more
moisture into my environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to the humidity because I
actually needed that in that grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time you are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that 70s bush, all that extra
foliage, all those leaves are good
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good place for bugs to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blocks light from your bud sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is great reason to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this situation, my room was getting
so dry that I just chose to leave a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of leaves on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it brought it up just a few
percent just to keep that room where I
[SPEAKER_01]: needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could water heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water in the plants would raise the
humidity just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of that evaporation from the
plants helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also all those leaves letting out
all that water from the stoma,
[SPEAKER_01]: that definitely helped me increase the
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do understand that a lot of times
that could be not visually appealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not best for the growth of
the room in most environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: in most occasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this one time in my grow space,
I tried a trick and it did exactly what I
[SPEAKER_01]: needed done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes these pet peeves are going to
be subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we've got to think about,
and this goes for the Internet and advice
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Internet as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see advice, if you see some
guidance, that may work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a certain situation, in a certain
environment, in a certain room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't always know what all the
situations in somebody's grow space may
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was struggling to keep my humidity up
because I had readjusted my ducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd made some changes and I was not going
to buy a humidifier simply for it was
[SPEAKER_01]: about 40 days worth of growth that I would
have needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That humidifier wasn't going to spend the
money on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm economical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my idea did work.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm getting at is there's more than
one way to skin a cat and sometimes the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we see in a grow that look
like a problem are actually a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to be open minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be kind of a MacGyver in a
grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be able to adjust and adapt
and you've got to be very open minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I would have been super stubborn
and said, no, I have to defoliate because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the way I operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually would have fucked up that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it did much better because I left
a bunch of leaf on those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my dude, patio toker, 75 or 85 percent
of the time, I do agree with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliate those damn plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But occasionally, like in my instance,
those leaves contributed to a little extra
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity and allowed me to increase the
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall VPD in the room was improved
because of that extra 70s bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, I'm still going to send you a
free pack of seeds even though I don't 100
[SPEAKER_01]: percent agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a great peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that it's subjective and I like
being able to talk about things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly disagree on, although we do agree
85 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude, check your email
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to work our way into the
question and answer portion of today's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is called iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is i-r-i-e-genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: iRe, it's a patois or a Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_01]: iRe means to feel the best you can feel,
to feel blessed, to feel at ease.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many ways I could use to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever been sitting maybe on the beach?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably at the beach, just a little bit
of sun coming down on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking out at the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're watching the waves crash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of breeze moving your
hair, but it's not uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nice, a nice breeze just moving
the hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got your lady with you,
your dude with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got your dog with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's your best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps it's your child with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're all by your damn self,
but maybe you're out there smoking a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a joint and you just got
this feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything just feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing could bother you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's feeling i-r-e.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel at ease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel peaceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching the ocean do its waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling the breeze in my hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the sunshine on my skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking a little spliff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some love next to me no matter who
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the feeling of being i-r-e.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when there's music playing and you're
at a concert and you got your hands up and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's vibing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the feeling of feeling i-r-e.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I choose the word i-r-e.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read to represent my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much better than feeling
i-r-e.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So i-r-e genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got off on a good ramble there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to that website i-r-e genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a list of tabs on the top of that
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs says grow help.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need grow help, click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give you the opportunity to ask us a
grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your question from that grow
help tab here on the podcast, I will send
[SPEAKER_01]: you a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
at i-r-e direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's first question came from a person
who wants to be called Ganjaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the party Ganjaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: By your real name, I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been around for a while,
so thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question says, hey Rasta Jeff,
I hope you are having a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, just like I said, everything i-r-e.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I am messaging here to ask about
your breeding setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice for a tour one day on
YouTube if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really enjoy showing you guys
my garden and my plants and my setups and
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but I'm sure you've noticed,
or maybe you haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have definitely noticed and YouTube
notices, every time I show a ganja plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in one of my videos, YouTube takes down my
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm allowed to show you my face,
my shirt, and this fucking curtain behind
[SPEAKER_01]: me, but that's about all you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I put plants up on the screen,
YouTube takes my video down immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they send me a community
guideline strike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I get too many of those,
they take away the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, I am not comfortable
showing my grow spaces or plants on this
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a very good topping video about
topping our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a plant on the table and showed you
where to top it and YouTube took that
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got a couple thousand views and then
YouTube took it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I took that top and showed you how
to make a clone out of it in another
[SPEAKER_01]: video.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube took that one down also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two videos I've attempted to
bring plants into the studio and do
[SPEAKER_01]: hands-on work with them and then YouTube
took it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, I'm not comfortable
doing a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a Patreon-only bonus or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's not anything that I've
got lined up, but it's a good idea now
[SPEAKER_01]: that I just said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rasta Jeff, when you're editing this,
write down the idea of doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon-only grow room tour episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't edit that part out so the people can
hear about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that a tour would be cool one day
if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it, but maybe on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm looking to start breeding my
own genetics so that I can keep strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that are no longer being produced and sold
and make my crosses of my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preservation is key, especially with the
possibility of the DEA changing scheduling
[SPEAKER_01]: on our favorite planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be much harder to acquire seeds in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk about that as time goes on as
things change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've promised to keep you updated on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I've got a few questions on the
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have come to the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, I do enjoy breeding questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, do you keep your male plants of
different strains in the same tent and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of your female plants in one tent in a
separate room, or can you keep them in one
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom altogether with no worries of
pollen since they are in veg?
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them father plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the boys that I have selected are
fathers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the female plants I've selected are
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mothers and fathers are all kept in the
same space during their mother and father
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just where I keep the plants just
to have the genetics on storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my stable, my preserve, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to keep all of those plants in
the same room, in the same space,
[SPEAKER_01]: because like you said, they are in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not have any pollen present until
several days into flower unless you make a
[SPEAKER_01]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes your male plants, if they get
root bound, if they don't get enough
[SPEAKER_01]: light, if they get underfed, if they just
start getting pissy in general for any
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, sometimes those plants will be
begin to go into flower and start dumping
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen for no reason, but you should see
that way ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can keep your father and mother
plants and your veg plants and your clones
[SPEAKER_01]: and your seedlings, for that matter,
basically all in the mother room and the
[SPEAKER_01]: father room and the stable, if you will,
keep them all in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend 18, at least 18 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly do 19 on and 5 off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the more, like I said a
moment ago, some of the more sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant plants, the more tropical
varietals, the haze varietals,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those will try to flower if you
give them too much dark time, if they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit root bound, if they're getting
underfed, if they get overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes those plants, just a few things,
will trigger those boys to try to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot have that happen because once
they start going into flower, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to turn a male back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once he gets started, he really wants to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will keep those on 19 hours on and 5
hours off in my mother area to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy growth and prevent those plants
from going into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can keep all those plants in the
same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would adjust that timer to 19 on 5 off
and then feed these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to need a heavy vegetative
diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically need just the grow bottle
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got that base nutrient,
the grow A, grow B, that's probably what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may need, I would feed them microbes,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may need a few other things based on
how big and how old they are, but keep an
[SPEAKER_01]: eye on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real easy to feed mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a basic vegetative nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking about that light
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to go 19 hours on and 5 off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I will reduce the intensity of
the light in my mother area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need these plants growing super
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need them getting really big very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need them to simply be healthy and
exist so that when I do need cuts,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are there and available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of turn the lights down a little
bit on these plants to slow the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed if I've got the plant,
the lights boosted up all the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: they grow too quickly for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to top them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to defoliate them too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just simply reduce the lights and they
grow beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow just fine for the way that I
need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there is another part to this
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, do you keep males?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, do you keep males of the same
strains in the same tent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because there is no pollen at this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you start making pollen,
everything must be separated, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, can you still grow a seedless
crop in the same house when breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely don't want to pollinate and
seed my medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And okay, so we're going to talk about
that first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding in a location where you're also
growing and hoping to have since Amelia
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have figured this art out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclosure, we could talk about it
now because it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to have a grow in my office is
right over there where I edit this show is
[SPEAKER_01]: just a room over on the other side of that
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That used to be a grow space on the other
in that office where you guys all see me
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out on discord and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That used to be a grow space with two five
by five tents and a three by three tent in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd put the boy plants in the three by
three and then use both five by fives on
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: One ran nine a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: to nine p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one ran nine p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: to nine a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I could maximize the electricity
in that room but not have to do any
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrades to the electrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a thousand watt light running at all
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a little 400 light running
from my boy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that boy he only had to be on
certain hours so he would take a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every 12 hours tent A would be on and
then every 12 hours tent B would be on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was always running a thousand watt
light in there but only one at a time
[SPEAKER_01]: running two flowering cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very very efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that room I was breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of your favorite strains that I made
came from that room in there when it used
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a grow space anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to I had to make some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys I was trying to the numbers got
changed here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to be allowed to grow so many more
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we cannot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a wasted grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn it into an office.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was a grow space up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That room had pollen in it all the
freaking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another grow space that is was in
the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was directly below that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another room basically a mirror of
that office in the basement of the house
[SPEAKER_01]: they were in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was where my main grow space was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to breed plants upstairs in
those two tents and not contaminate and
[SPEAKER_01]: seed the grow that I had downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it took a few tricks to figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing that I learned and
here's a golden piece of advice if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: a breeder if you're thinking about
breeding this is going to be one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes and this is going to be one of
the things you want to write write down or
[SPEAKER_01]: record or take a note of.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I really found important
that really helped me out breeding seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and growing sensi crops in the same house
is timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it's about is timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant upstairs dumping
pollen don't have other plants downstairs
[SPEAKER_01]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have those in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you chop down that male plant
and clean up the pollen put that other
[SPEAKER_01]: room downstairs in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've only got pollen around for about 21
days if you do it properly maybe maybe up
[SPEAKER_01]: to 25 28 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't need pollen around for
that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of your plants are going to get hit
by pollen by day 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would recommend have your
breeding room get your breeding room
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put those plants don't have another room
in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me back up a step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest your sensi milia room the room you
don't want seeds in harvest it right
[SPEAKER_01]: before you harvest that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have another room in flower
that you want to breed or in veg that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to breed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So harvest your seedless crop while you've
got another room vegging that you plan to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you harvest flip that other
crop to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In about 14 days you'll start seeing the
boys about 21 days you'll chuck pollen by
[SPEAKER_01]: day 25 28 pollen has been chucked cut down
that male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have another room in veg
downstairs already that is ready to flower
[SPEAKER_01]: by the time that crop gets about 30 45
days in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then flip the other room as long as these
plants downstairs are not in flower if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in veg they cannot receive
pollens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no stress no worries no fear no
risk of pollinating that crop as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: it stays in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't have both of them in flower
at the same time but it's just a very
[SPEAKER_01]: short juggle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would do a flower crop with no seeds
in one room and then a seeded crop in one
[SPEAKER_01]: room right after that and then back to
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do flower seed flower seed and as long
as you clean up properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between runs you won't have any
contamination so it's all about setting
[SPEAKER_01]: the rhythm have this room in the one you
want to seed have it in veg while your
[SPEAKER_01]: flower room is growing harvest your
flowers put your breeding crop into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately cut more clones for your other
flowering room and get that filled up and
[SPEAKER_01]: have it in veg pollinate the breeding room
clean up by clean up I mean cut down that
[SPEAKER_01]: boy plant sweep up all the pollen then
spray everything with water water
[SPEAKER_01]: deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get a I use a pump sprayer it's a deck
spray it holds two gallons of water I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just fill that bad bitch up with water I
actually may put push in there from
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic research it's a veg bloom
product it's called push it's a foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: application it's a great product put that
push in there shake that up spray every
[SPEAKER_01]: single plant also spray the walls spray
everything down just to kill any pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: that may be in that room I'll do that a
couple of times I'll go in there and spray
[SPEAKER_01]: water a couple of times just to make sure
I've deactivated all of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now once I'm confident that all of the
pollen is cleaned up put that other room
[SPEAKER_01]: into flower now those seeds will finish
while your other room is starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower you can harvest your seeds and then
your other senti crop will finish and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will be seedless if you do it properly and
time it properly it's all about timing
[SPEAKER_01]: that is how I make it happen that's how I
made this house produced a lot of flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of seeds at the same time
unfortunately since the new stupid rules
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado I can't do that I've got to
either make seeds at one time or run a
[SPEAKER_01]: regular crop at one time or use other
houses and facilities which is seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the trick but I'm very limited here so
we're not doing all that multiple room
[SPEAKER_01]: shit anymore it's all about that rhythm
just don't have your senti crop in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: while you've got pollen in the air and
everything should work beautifully now if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do insist on having that male plant in
flower while you've got a crop in another
[SPEAKER_01]: room like I said before water deactivates
pollen try to keep everything as far apart
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible try to have so one thing I
recommend is if you can set it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: your ducting wherever the male plants are
kept have that or where your pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: room is have that ventilation go out of
your grow facility if you can duck that
[SPEAKER_01]: outside you may end up pollinating the
outdoor people's grow if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: careful but try to I use a carbon filter
so I'm thinking most of my shits getting
[SPEAKER_01]: caught in the filter but try to duck that
pollen out so that you don't accidentally
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminate the other rooms inside your
grow facility water deactivates everything
[SPEAKER_01]: if you leave that pollen room try to I've
got dreadlocks dude so there's pollen in
[SPEAKER_01]: my dreads I'm sure of it but try to wrap
your dreads up in a hat try to wear a hat
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can change clothes if you could
take a shower I recommend that before
[SPEAKER_01]: going from room to room but water will
deactivate that pollen if you need to go
[SPEAKER_01]: from room to room I would say go spray the
senti room with water then go do your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in the pollen room then carry that
water with you and when you go back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the other room spray it again spray
yourself water will be your best friend in
[SPEAKER_01]: that situation so I think that's the best
I can answer you for that one I told you
[SPEAKER_01]: how I did it it's all about that rhythm
don't have the seedless crop in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: when there's pollen and only have the
pollen plants or the pollinated plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower when you're ready to pollinate them
it seems to be the easiest way to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more though it says can you use
multiple males at once in the same house I
[SPEAKER_01]: would not do that do not use multiple
males just separate your breeding projects
[SPEAKER_01]: just time them out properly it doesn't
take as much time as you're thinking it
[SPEAKER_01]: does to breed seeds you can chuck pollen
and get that male out of there in 30 days
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just need to let those seeds
finish up get the next male in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: crop going in another room and move them
up there as soon as you harvest and that
[SPEAKER_01]: would work beautifully but I do not
recommend two males at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna have a maury povich situation
that pollen is going to cross and get on
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants it's not gonna work the
way that you want it to who knows who the
[SPEAKER_01]: baby daddy is at that point it turns into
a spring break situation what precautions
[SPEAKER_01]: would you take to make sure you don't
transfer pollen between tents water water
[SPEAKER_01]: water water and proper ventilation is the
answer is a different bedroom needed
[SPEAKER_01]: entirely I would do it in a completely
different bedroom I honestly did it in
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different sections of the house
upstairs and downstairs put a nice barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: between there they were actually like I
said before the rooms were directly on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of and below each other and the stairs are
at the opposite into the house so I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: go all the way from one end to the other
then all the way back down to the other so
[SPEAKER_01]: for pollen to travel with me there it was
possible but it was much more unlikely
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was such a distance is a
different bedroom needed yes I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: so and showering and changing clothes that
is obvious I think you should definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: do that to not move that pollen around but
like I'm saying like the main thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: make this work here is just don't have
plants you don't want seeded in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: when there's pollen because the pistols
are what receive pollen also too late into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower the plants won't receive pollen
either once the pistols are all weathered
[SPEAKER_01]: up and dry and brown those plants are past
their estrous past their sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive stage they cannot receive
pollen at that point so you could throw
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen at that point also and not have to
worry about those plants let me make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it the end of it says also what
happened to Jack the Ripper nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to Jack the Ripper I've still got
a good Jack the Ripper male I've got two
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack the Ripper females they're just
taking a little break I've been honestly
[SPEAKER_01]: regular seeds do not sell making reg seeds
right now doesn't seem to be a very wise
[SPEAKER_01]: move for the market for the business
because 90% of my seed sales are feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds so making the Jack the Ripper seeds
again or more crosses of that they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: probably most likely sit there on the
shelf which is why reg seeds are on sale
[SPEAKER_01]: on I redirect right now for ten or twenty
dollars a pack you can get a ten pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds for ten dollars at I redirect go
take advantage of that sale I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: breathe life into the regular seed market
let people know that reg seeds are awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: are popular are viable they should not be
afraid which is really funny because ten
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago we had to do the same thing with
FEM seeds everybody thought FEMs were
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic they were afraid of them we
educated the masses and now that's all
[SPEAKER_01]: that sells people forgot about the regs
but Jack the Ripper is still around
[SPEAKER_01]: ripping jacking chilling it's in the grow
space I've got a mom I've got two moms I
[SPEAKER_01]: got a dude in there they may do work in
the future but right now they're taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: break and I'm focused on the feminized
seeds I've got a couple of great FEM
[SPEAKER_01]: projects coming up I'm gonna make more
golden goat crosses there will be great
[SPEAKER_01]: grateful dog crosses but I've got a new
plant that is gorgeous I haven't talked
[SPEAKER_01]: too much about it it needs to be bred with
so that is going to be a project in the
[SPEAKER_01]: near future I am saying too much already
let's move on this one says I really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate the advice this will be super
helpful I wish you the best my dude
[SPEAKER_01]: ganjaman thank you for a good question I
love talking about breeding I love talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about pollen so this was a great question
for both of us my dude make sure you check
[SPEAKER_01]: your inbox because you've got a coupon
code for a free pack of seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: ireadirect.com alright I'm not sure how
long we've been going but we're gonna jump
[SPEAKER_01]: into one more message anyway this one is
going to be a fun one this one also came
[SPEAKER_01]: from the grow help tab on ireagenetics.com
this one came from somebody who wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: be called Tilly the question is do you
think it's worth it to try popping bag
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and hope to cross each other and
make new genetics alright that's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good question that's a multi-part question
there you were kind of putting the cart
[SPEAKER_01]: before the horse with this breeding part
but bag seed what is a bag seed let's talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about that briefly what is a bag seed bag
seed is any seed that came from your bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed let's say you got a bag of purple
skittle dicks right because purple skittle
[SPEAKER_01]: dicks is gonna be the new popular strain
you got this big bag of purple skittle
[SPEAKER_01]: dicks right you find seeds in there those
are bag seed many people are going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got purple skittle dick seed but
guess what you don't because who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: what that seed came from we know that the
feed female portion of that plant was
[SPEAKER_01]: purple skittle dicks who was the pollen
donor who the baby daddy this is a maury
[SPEAKER_01]: povich situation we don't know if that
plant was self pollinated we don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant was pollinated by an intersex
plant we don't know if it was pollinated
[SPEAKER_01]: by a regular plant we don't know who the
baby daddy was so that is simply labeled
[SPEAKER_01]: bag seed it came from a bag now are those
worth growing the answer to that is fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah dude grow that bag seed that could be
the most amazing plant on the planet or
[SPEAKER_01]: also it could be pure garbage some of the
most popular strains on the planet came
[SPEAKER_01]: from bag seed maybe you've heard of a
little cross called chem dog there's chem
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 chem D there's chem OG there's others
more that I can't fucking think of off the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of my head but the chem dog lineage
all of the chem dog lines came from bag
[SPEAKER_01]: seed a guy bought a bag of weed there were
13 seeds in it he grew some of those from
[SPEAKER_01]: there came that chem 91 the chem sister
the chem D all of the major famous chem
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals came from bag seed so you may
have the next amazing line also Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies is believed to have come from a
cherry pie bag seed it was a bag of cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: pie with the seed in there I'm gonna throw
out my theory I think it was a men Paki
[SPEAKER_01]: citral Kush that pollinated that cherry
pie just from some stories that I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is what made the Girl Scout
cookies we will never know but technically
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl Scout cookies from what we know was
bag seed also gorilla glue and golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: were accidents which are technically bag
seed they weren't meant to happen it was
[SPEAKER_01]: an accident accidental breeding project
somebody's pollen got away in their grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room they found seeds in their weed those
two strains are two of the most popular
[SPEAKER_01]: strains on the market so I would
definitely grow out those bag seed do not
[SPEAKER_01]: sell them trade them or give them away and
if you do give them to anybody make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that grower knows that what they've got is
not a reputable tested seed they have got
[SPEAKER_01]: bag seeds you could produce intersex
plants you could produce crazy fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: mutants we don't know what's gonna come
from that so be very open if you give that
[SPEAKER_01]: to anybody I recommend you grow it you may
have like I keep saying you may have the
[SPEAKER_01]: next Girl Scout cookies you could have the
next a Mac one on your hands who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: what you've got in there now until you've
grown this plant several times you've beat
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit out of it you have stress tested
it maybe you've let a couple of friends
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it in different environments I would
not breed with this plant until you have
[SPEAKER_01]: fully investigated this plant's potential
is it intersex if it shows any intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: traits do not breed with it if it shows
you mutations or problems do not breed
[SPEAKER_01]: with it the entire point of breeding is to
improve this plant the entire point of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding is to make plant a and plant B
and put them together and make a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that is better than both of those plants
if that is not possible if that is not the
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome abandon that project don't put a
crappy hermaphroditic plant into a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding project that is not setting
yourself up for success that is setting
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself up for failure and not doing a
service to the community or our plants so
[SPEAKER_01]: let me get back to the notes and get
myself back on track is it worth trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: pop bag seeds the answer is fuck yeah dude
pop those grow them get a clone who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: what you've got but in hopes to cross each
other and make new genetics I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: breed to anything unless I have thoroughly
stress tested it grown it several times
[SPEAKER_01]: identified its weaknesses its pros its
cons find out what pisses it off find out
[SPEAKER_01]: what makes it happy most importantly find
out if there are any intersex traits and
[SPEAKER_01]: then most importantly is there a reason to
breed with these plants are you just
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding them because you've got them I
got a boy I got a girl they gonna fuck or
[SPEAKER_01]: do you see traits in this plant is there a
reason is there a structure vigor flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma color leaf shape flowering time
trichome density internodal spacing
[SPEAKER_01]: potency pathogen resistance pest
resistance drought resistance are there
[SPEAKER_01]: pros and cons to these plants are there
reasons to make this plant worth breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: or are you just making them fuck because
you got them that's what I want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: all right I think I have answered this
question pretty thoroughly my friend Tilly
