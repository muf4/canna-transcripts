dot com all right that should wrap up all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the business part of this podcast let's
move our way into the fun part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode i've been doing i'm not sure if
it's been an experiment on myself or if
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been noticing something about myself
but i noticed that last week i could smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and not get the buzz i desired
i could smoke all the concentrates i could
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke all the flowers i ate some edibles
and i was just not achieving the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: medication or the buzz level that i was
trying to achieve and i was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated with it i was just smoking more
i thought maybe i need to take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a break but then this week i don't
know what's going on but things have
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced themselves out this week all i
have to do is take a little tiny itty
[SPEAKER_00]: bitty little dab and i feel like i'm just
completely wrecked i'm getting so lit off
[SPEAKER_00]: of my dabs i'm making up for the excessive
consumption last week and i'm saving some
[SPEAKER_00]: this week just because when i do smoke i'm
getting extra lit so my question to you is
[SPEAKER_00]: do you go through phases where sometimes
you can look at your dabs and catch a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz or other times when you can smoke all
of the dabs and not even get a buzz at all
[SPEAKER_00]: is that just me is that something
seasonally is that something with my diet
[SPEAKER_00]: something with my mood something with
blood sugar brain chemistry who knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on but i want to know is it
just me does that sort of stuff happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: you also send me a message grow from your
heart at hotmail.com or hit me on twitter
[SPEAKER_00]: or social media let me know am i the only
one going through this weird phenomena of
[SPEAKER_00]: where sometimes i can buy a few grams of
concentrates and they'll last me a week
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sometimes i could buy the same
amount of concentrates and it will last me
[SPEAKER_00]: a day is it just me or do you do that also
let me know because man last week i smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: double what i normally smoke and this week
i'm smoking half of what i normally smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and i really notice a huge difference but
i'm not doing anything differently diet
[SPEAKER_00]: wise or life or physically wise it's just
seems to be the only difference is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: colder now and that doesn't really i don't
think that makes a difference it is super
[SPEAKER_00]: cold today hasn't been so cold i don't
know if that makes any sense all right
[SPEAKER_00]: where do we go from there all right let's
segue into our next topic i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something i think will be fun to talk
about my question to you is are you doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden that are completely useless because
they are it's a habit and they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: why they're actually doing the steps that
they are doing we spend a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: money energy and effort on our garden and
we hope to have a beautiful outcome if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can streamline the amount of time we spend
in there the amount of money and the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of energy that we have to put into
that garden and still get a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome i think that helps us out one of
my job is a jobs as a consultant is to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to your commercial facility walk around
for a day view your grow your employees
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants and see what's happening and
then it is my job to make that grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: proficient if it's better production less
cost i'm there to increase productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: and save money so there are several ways
you could probably do that in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm not at your growth so i don't know
what's going on but the next time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in there think about it are the moves and
steps that i'm making are they necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: think about from the minute you open the
door to that grow to when you start mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrients to when you check your ph
to where you do everything in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: when you touch the plants when you
whatever you're doing is there a rhyme and
[SPEAKER_00]: a reason for it think about why am i doing
the action i am doing right now what does
[SPEAKER_00]: this do to my plants what does it do to my
plants right now later today tomorrow in
[SPEAKER_00]: three days and seven days and two weeks in
the long run before harvest time think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the full outcome of everything you
were doing to those plants keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that the things you do to your plants
today may not show you results or benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: very soon it may be two three five seven
days it could be two weeks five weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks down the line before you see the
results go you should do this and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing that in your grow maybe your
style has changed maybe your room has
[SPEAKER_00]: changed maybe your equipment changed that
thing i told you might not even be
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary anymore my grow evolves and
changes probably more quickly than a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people because i have a lot more input
and also more experience i'm not as afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: to experiment and maybe kill a couple of
plants that's another thing i should talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about don't get so trapped into your
routine that you're afraid to try new
[SPEAKER_00]: things be able to maybe risk a plant or
two and that's how you learn and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: expand and how you improve if you don't
take risks you will not get better so what
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm saying is are you doing things in your
grow because it's a habit because you
[SPEAKER_00]: learned it from somebody a long time ago
and you've just been doing it or does
[SPEAKER_00]: every step of your grow have a purpose a
rhyme a reason and a method why are you
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that if you can eliminate that step
and save yourself some time don't do it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can eliminate a product or a step
that'll save you money that's beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: right away we all like saving more money
you can buy yourself more things but try
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a reason for everything you were
doing in that grow if i were there
[SPEAKER_00]: watching you and i said hey bro why did
you do that you should have a solid reason
[SPEAKER_00]: if i did that because of this no i just i
do that every time i've been doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: for years okay why do you do that every
time why have you been doing that for
[SPEAKER_00]: years what is your reason for the actions
you are taking every action has an equal
[SPEAKER_00]: and opposite reaction are you getting a
benefit are you messing up your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you doing let's think about
everything we're doing in there and i want
[SPEAKER_00]: to give a big shout out to my dogs because
this part of the show is inspired by my
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs let me tell you a funny short story
here i got into a relationship with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lovely lady she had two puppies when you
get out of the shower at that house those
[SPEAKER_00]: two puppies they're not puppies are small
terrier dogs they're adult small terriers
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get out of the shower those two
terriers love to lick your feet when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are wet they just want to lick your ankles
in your feet when you're wet recently we
[SPEAKER_00]: got another dog probably close to a year
ago we got another dog that dog has
[SPEAKER_00]: learned that he likes to lick feet also
the dog has no idea why he likes to lick
[SPEAKER_00]: feet he doesn't know what it does he
doesn't know what he's doing but he knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that every time i get out of the shower he
really wants to come into the bathroom and
[SPEAKER_00]: lick my feet he learned it from tika who
guess what learned it from the dog that
[SPEAKER_00]: was previous to that one who has since
passed away a dog taught another dog
[SPEAKER_00]: something and now that dog has taught
another dog something and that dog thinks
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a way of life that is something is
required and it has absolutely no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why that is a requirement of its life i
thought it was silly to learn that one dog
[SPEAKER_00]: taught another dog and that dog taught
another dog and that third dog has no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: why he's doing it the first dog probably
doesn't either but i was like that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: people in their grow rooms people are just
doing shit because they saw that dog do it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that dog did it and now guess
what that dog's gonna do it too and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even know why so shout out to the
dogs they definitely inspired that portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the podcast are you being a silly dog
or is there a reason for you to be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the crazy shit that you're doing in your
grow all right let's do move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: because that was a fun silly subject i
really did enjoy that one all right now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's jump into my next topic i was
recently at a friend's grow and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about how they have switched to
amended soil and they're doing a living
[SPEAKER_00]: organic amended soil so that they don't
have to feed bottled nutrients they went
[SPEAKER_00]: on to talk about how their bottled
nutrient required them to do too much work
[SPEAKER_00]: so i just kept listening and let them kind
of talk they revealed to me that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: taking each bottle and filling a container
with water and adding the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage of that nutrient to the five gallon
bucket mixing it up pouring that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants then they would take the next
bottle that was recommended mix that into
[SPEAKER_00]: a five gallon bucket and pour some of that
into each plant so this person was under
[SPEAKER_00]: the impression that their base nutrient
the cal mag bottle the booster bottle the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme bottle all had to be mixed
separately into containers of water then
[SPEAKER_00]: fed to the plants if you were doing that
that is a lot of extra work i hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: made sense the way i explained it there
are several bottles in your feed regimen i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know which company you chose some
people are under the impression that each
[SPEAKER_00]: of those bottles needs to be mixed into
its own container of water and fed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that is not the case let me teach
you how i recommend mixing your bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients if you do choose to use bottled
nutrients this will work for reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis water this will work for tap water
this is just my basic advice and method of
[SPEAKER_00]: how i recommend you mix your bottled
nutrients i'm going to start with a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket here just a lowes bucket a
home depot bucket whatever five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket you've got that's what i'm going to
talk about using for my starting container
[SPEAKER_00]: so i've got my five gallon bucket i fill
it about 80 to 90 percent of the way with
[SPEAKER_00]: water i need some mixing space i don't
want to spill this shit everywhere i leave
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an inch inch and a half at the top
so that i've got some work in room so i
[SPEAKER_00]: fill my bucket with water now i add my
nutrients one nutrient at a time by the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended dosage what you're going to
feed it is up to you i would start off
[SPEAKER_00]: with maybe 50 percent of the recommended
dosage on the bottle maybe 70 you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need 100 of what they recommend
you'll really be pushing your plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: is another podcast we'll talk about at
another time but select your bottles that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to feed understand how much
of each bottle you need to feed now i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to stay we're going to we're
going to start with one bottle measure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how much you're going to use i'm going to
say 10 mils per five gallon container so
[SPEAKER_00]: you put your 10 milliliters in your
measuring device and you pour that into
[SPEAKER_00]: the five gallon container now you get the
next bottle and before you pour any bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: always shake it that's something that i
should mention grab the bottle shake it
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it pour it into your five gallon
container now the next bottle we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to you might want to clean out your your
measuring container that's always a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea wipe that out give it a quick wipe
with a paper towel or a rag make that
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh and clean grab your next bottle
shake it up let's just say we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do 10 more milliliters of this product
measure out 10 milliliters close your
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle back up pour that 10 milliliters
into the same five gallon bucket we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put all of our products into the
same five gallon bucket of water i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much water you need to water your
entire crop or your room or this run or
[SPEAKER_00]: this light or whatever but mix up the
appropriate amount of water and we can put
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the nutrients into that water at
one time we don't have to mix up separate
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels for every product that is highly
unnecessary that is a lot of extra work i
[SPEAKER_00]: realize now that a couple of people were
mixing that way so they were mixing if
[SPEAKER_00]: there were six bottles in the product
lineup they were mixing six buckets of
[SPEAKER_00]: water and then trying to feed a little bit
of each bucket to each plant that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a struggle that's a lot of extra
thinking carrying mixing working that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: phing that's a big pain in the ass so get
your bucket fill it with water get your
[SPEAKER_00]: first nutrient i recommend and this is
just a suggestion or recommendation i
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you start with your silicates
first get your silicate bottle shake that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up measure out the amount that you
need pour it into your five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: container and stir it counterclockwise
that's my recommendation stir it
[SPEAKER_00]: counterclockwise get it a good spin make
sure it's nice and mixed in there then i
[SPEAKER_00]: would use my base nutrient would be net
next clean out my measuring container find
[SPEAKER_00]: my base nutrient bottle give it a good
solid shake so nothing's at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all mixed up real well measure out
the amount that i need probably somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 25 and 50 milliliters possibly 100
milliliters if you're using a botanic care
[SPEAKER_00]: product pour that into your five gallon
container your silicates are in there now
[SPEAKER_00]: your base nutrients are in there once
again give it a stir give it a good solid
[SPEAKER_00]: stir so that it's going to keep on
stirring so that when we add our next
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle which i would recommend at this
point will probably be that bottle of cal
[SPEAKER_00]: mag find the clean out your measuring
container find your bottle of cal mag
[SPEAKER_00]: measure out the appropriate amount close
your bottle back up pour that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon container it's still spinning
from when he stirred it up real hard a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute ago still spinning so just rely on
that spin keep it going then i would add
[SPEAKER_00]: the boosters then the enzymes and then i
would do the microbes last some people
[SPEAKER_00]: will tell you to ph your water after you
add your microbes and some people will say
[SPEAKER_00]: to ph your water before you add microbes
i've had success with both methods so get
[SPEAKER_00]: the water stirred up add your potassium
silicate or your silicate nutrients then
[SPEAKER_00]: your base nutrients then all of your
add-ins your cal mag your bloom boosters
[SPEAKER_00]: your enzymes and then i would recommend
probably the microbes last and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the ph before or after those
microbes let's talk about that after
[SPEAKER_00]: you've mixed in all of your nutrients
everything you're going to put in there
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a good mix make sure everything is
mixed in really well stir it
[SPEAKER_00]: counterclockwise then when you're done
give it just a couple of good clockwise
[SPEAKER_00]: stirs to mix everything in real nice there
then we want to adjust the ph if we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to this is where i recommend a high
quality ph pen i use a blue lab pen and i
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate it probably every 10 days i
should do it once a week i hit it about
[SPEAKER_00]: every 10 days two weeks to be honest with
you calibrate the ph pen then dunk that ph
[SPEAKER_00]: pen right into your five gallon bucket of
water of your solution is what now that is
[SPEAKER_00]: and measure the ph of that we want that ph
to be somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5 that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be the acceptable range i like
6.4 myself i really think 6.4 is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: spot for the ph the way you're going to
change that if it's too high if you put
[SPEAKER_00]: your ph meter in there and it says
anything above 6.5 you need a bottle of ph
[SPEAKER_00]: down and put a couple of drops of ph down
stir it and measure that ph again go slow
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ph up or down products because it
only takes a little tiny bit to ruin the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire mix you can go too high or too low
very very quickly also i recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: wear gloves and eye protection when you
are using the ph up and or ph down
[SPEAKER_00]: products also don't mix those if you've
put too much ph down in there i wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend putting ph up in there to fix
that only use one of those products at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time that will cause that could
potentially cause you problems depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on the nutrients that you are using so we
have filled our bucket we have put our
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium silicates in there we stir it
put our base newts give it a stir cow mag
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a stir every other nutrient maybe
give it a stir between them unless you can
[SPEAKER_00]: rely on that spin action that you've
created some there are some people that
[SPEAKER_00]: will put up a pump in that bucket just to
keep it moving that's a little excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a five gallon anything bigger put
a mix pump in there get it stirring add
[SPEAKER_00]: all your nutrients put your microbes in
there last then let's adjust the ph get it
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5 6.4 is the
sweet spot in my opinion i think nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: really absorb well at that point then
adjust your ph then something i really
[SPEAKER_00]: find important write everything down what
did you put in there write down every
[SPEAKER_00]: product that write down the date the time
every product that you put in how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: it you put in then write down the ph the
next thing i would recommend is measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: the ec or the ppms it doesn't matter to me
which one you use as long as you pick one
[SPEAKER_00]: and stick with it that's all that matters
you can get a pen that does ec and ph
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll change them with the push of a
button pick one go with the ec or the pa
[SPEAKER_00]: or the ppms i mean i apologize for saying
the wrong letter a moment ago lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: letters and acronyms in my brain pick the
ec or the ppms write that down every time
[SPEAKER_00]: you mix up a solution write down the ph
and the ec of that solution before you
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it to your plants document it this
may help you in the future so we've mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: everything up we have adjusted our ph
we've written down the ec now let's water
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants if you've got uh decent sized
plants that are healthy and they've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: established root zone within their pot i
recommend watering your plants till
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between 15 and 25 percent runoff
you want water coming out of the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: your pots when you get that runoff coming
out of the pots i recommend collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it and testing the ph and the ec
of that runoff it's real easy just stick
[SPEAKER_00]: the two pens in that container and it will
show you on the screen the ph is this the
[SPEAKER_00]: ec is this at this time don't stress worry
or concern yourself with those numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: until we see a problem with the plants
those numbers do not matter once we see
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with the plants we can start
looking at the numbers of what we put in
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the numbers that came out if the
numbers of the ec is too high the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't eating if the ph is too low we can
just adjust and make corrections based on
[SPEAKER_00]: that but i do not make any changes to the
runoff until i see the plants are angry if
[SPEAKER_00]: it ain't broke don't fix it we're just
going to use these numbers for reference
[SPEAKER_00]: if we do have a problem this is data this
is failsafe data for if there is a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: don't rely too much on this unless you see
issues so water till you get runoff then
[SPEAKER_00]: collect some of that water and measure the
ec and the ph and mark that down like i
[SPEAKER_00]: said don't worry about the numbers now but
they're there if we need them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future so at this point you should have
everything written down just as good if
[SPEAKER_00]: not better all right ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls pimps and hoes friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: foes smokers growers clone cutters pauline
