[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome to the show podcast
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 736 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to focus on a
couple of listener emails.

[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include that link in
the show notes and in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it nice and easy for
all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble too long here at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a nice stack of listener emails
here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first message did come from the Grow
Help tab on the iReGenetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you visit my website, iregenetics.com,
there is a tab that says Grow Help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply click on that Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you the opportunity to tell
me about your grow and ask a few grow
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know the relative humidity,
the temperature of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if you're growing indoors
and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what kind of plants you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you tell me that, I give you the
opportunity to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will do my best to use that info
to answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one did come from our friend Mike,
and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, thanks for your
response on the show about growing out
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if you listened to the previous
episodes, I did talk about growing mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a listener send an email and their
mother plants were dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't performing well when they
would put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a follow up on that email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what you said did make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think they were rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was root bound because I trimmed the
root ball and transplanted them from two
[SPEAKER_00]: to three gallon containers before
flipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may eliminate one opportunity why
they were getting sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says the real question is I've
grown out four different cultivars and
[SPEAKER_00]: only one of them just straight dies every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many anomalies, so many
variables here that I'm not exactly sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he does go on to say because of low
yields, I don't think I will waste time
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out the mothers anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good idea unless you are
planning and prepping from the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow out those mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be best just to retire them,
toss them, use them as clone donors,
[SPEAKER_00]: then set them to the side, trash them,
put them in the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that I enjoy and I
admire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect and appreciate the idea that
people want to use everything that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, but it's not always
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're going to spend more time,
energy, money, resources on trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: something out of your waste than you could
have just thrown it away and actually not
[SPEAKER_00]: spent that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get much out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you don't have anything to
do, if you're just looking for something
[SPEAKER_00]: to do on Saturday, you want to figure out
how to turn all this wasted leaf into a
[SPEAKER_00]: juice, that may be something to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time it is not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we got to bite the bullet and
throw things away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it and I respect it,
but sometimes it's not worth your time,
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up spending more energy,
more time, buying more equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what you get isn't worth the
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just gone to the dispensary
possibly and bought that for a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, once again, you don't have to
use everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do admire that you're trying to use
those mother plants, but it may be time to
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in the compost bin and realize
they have done what they needed to do for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the followup, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is crazy that you're up potting them
and they are still not acting right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the pot is shocking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many variables that I just
don't know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me more info, send me more details,
or it looks like you may have just given
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the idea altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we can do from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Rasta Jeff, I have a quick
question if I may.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to read this one
because we'll just read it and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what would happen if I
pollenized, and it does say pollenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen if I pollenized a male
plant with another male's pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be F1s with trait from both
males, just like a male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to, then it says,
cheers and kiss your mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, if it's worth it,
you can mention my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to mention your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm being
trolled, to be quite honest with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to answer this like a
serious question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be trolling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a real question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants cannot receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants only give pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female plants receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pollenize a male with another
male all you want, and all you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get is a male plant with more pollen
dusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is going to happen except a
pollinated mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a bunch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will happen if you put male pollen
from a male plant onto another male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants cannot receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have ovules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have all the parts needed to
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like two dudes rubbing wieners,
two piles of semen, two piles of sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't make anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need an egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a sperm to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male, female, basic biology, basic
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how plants work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do weird things with plants,
but with two male plants, we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: touching peepees, and this isn't going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sword fight is all this is,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the reason for my question is I
have two male plants from different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, and both have unique traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a mad scientist, I like new,
weird projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pick one of those males and use it
and throw the other one away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick your favorite, use it, toss the other
one, or use them separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to pollinate female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe get a female plant, do one cycle
of pollen from male A, do another run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be a totally separate run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to finish the plants, cut it down,
dry it, cure it, then do a different
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, plant B, pollinate that with the
same male and see what that male is
[SPEAKER_00]: offering to your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line here is this is basic
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not sure if I'm being trolled,
and if not, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be respectful to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a real question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males do not receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males give pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things you guys call hairs,
those are pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what actually receive the
pollen, and that pollen will slide down
[SPEAKER_00]: that little hair into more parts of the
plant and make a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that part, the seeding cannot
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my friend, I hope I answered your
question, and I hope I can encourage you
[SPEAKER_00]: to read some basic grow books and basic
biology with all due respect, because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some basics, some basic schooling
that got skipped there, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one says, hey, Rasta Jeff,
this one came from our friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: SpacemanSpuff, very unique name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just realized, okay,
there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut out some of this
because this is a two-part message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I forgot to mention that the 18
to six light cycle for the last seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days of flower does seem to work for me
as far as bulking up plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great bit of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have talked about in a lot of previous
episodes about putting our plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: our flowering plants under 18 hours of
lighting at the end of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 on and six off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think I'm absolutely
freaking crazy for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that have tried it have given
me great praise, great feedback,
[SPEAKER_00]: and great thanks for giving them the
information because they are all
[SPEAKER_00]: completely satisfied with the results of
this new technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last seven to 10, maybe 10 to 14
days of a flowering cycle, I will return
[SPEAKER_00]: my lights to an 18 six cycle, 18 hours on,
six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives the plants more photons,
more light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do ripen up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I get more weight and faster when
I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend says, I forgot to mention
the 18 to six light cycle for the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days of flower does seem to work as far as
bulking up my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure it did much for one of my
plants, but there was a noticeable bulking
[SPEAKER_00]: up on my other plant, especially on the
top main cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's where you're going to notice
it the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just want to know if going any
longer than 10 days at 18 six will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: any problems or cause reef edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, will this cause any problems with
re-vegging?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got like a three part question
here, which is super great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also included some pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, your plants look awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I replied and asked what strain
that was because that top cola looked
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if that's not one of my crosses,
you did a great job with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend is running the 18 six light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is curious if he wants to know if going
longer than 10 days at 18 six will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: any problems or possible re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second or maybe third part of the
question is, will it mess up a re-veg if
[SPEAKER_00]: they do intend to re-veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going longer than 10 days, maybe 14,
maybe 15, maybe 16 days shouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will start to see signs of re-veg
before there are any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will look like the buds are just
getting little nubs at the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like little leaves are starting
to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very first sign of that,
I recommend to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take probably a minimum of 14,
maybe 16, 17 days before you will start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By then, by now, your plants should be
done unless you started your 18 six light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle way too early, which is why
sometimes I recommend to run the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: one time on a normal light cycle before we
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do this with a brand new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never dated this girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what she likes normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know how to make things
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never learned how to make it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't do this the first time on a
run with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait to do this the second,
maybe the third run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've done it on the first time
and you found that you're going to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer to flower, just pay
attention to those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may start developing a little,
it looks like a fox tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the tip is starting to put
out more leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your first sign of re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can chop immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes may not be where you want
them to be, but you can harvest at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-vegging doesn't happen like instantly,
like overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it start to pop up on a couple of
buds, probably smaller buds toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it start to happen and then
you'll say, oh shit, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut everything down at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds may not look completely perfect,
but you'll see it before it is problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the plants aren't ready by that
point, they should be because they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: under 18-6 for 10, 14, 16, 17,
maybe 20 days at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are definitely going to start
finishing more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part of the question was,
will 18-6 cause problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if you go for too long and then it
says, will it cause, or re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only problem I assume you may
run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is if you go for extremely too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third part of this question is,
will it cause any problems with the re-veg
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this will actually encourage and
increase the success of your re-vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are already starting the re-veg process
10 to 14 days before we harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is already being told some weird
shit's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our light cycle changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need to make some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones will start shifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start making differences within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will change in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you about 10 or 14 days later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what we don't cut down, if we leave
that, that plant has already technically
[SPEAKER_00]: been in re-veg, the start of re-veg for
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get your re-veg success much more
quickly than most of your other re-veg
[SPEAKER_00]: attempts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it will increase the luck of
your re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll make your plants bulkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not think you will run into any
problems unless of course you started this
[SPEAKER_00]: way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend, SpacemanSpuff,
I wanna thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any follow-ups, you do know
how to reach me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the email address is
growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me those messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have another one here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, after shuffling through these
papers, I did find the message I am
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna read Michael's full name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just wanted to start by saying
I've been listening and supporting for a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a flower grower in a illegal
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna run and I have a bunch to run,
but I don't have the time to run,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone, and sex all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great, good question right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've built a hella grow,
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, he talks a lot about his grow,
which we don't need to talk too much about
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, our friend has,
let's see, what's the word here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch to run and I don't have
time to run them, clone them, and sex them
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely, as a seed breeder,
maybe a seed hoarder, definitely a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: collector, I may understand this problem
of having a lot of seeds and not having
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, space, energy, fucking
resources, basically the space and
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly the legal capacity to run as many
numbers as I would like to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were up to me, I'd be running 500
small plants at a time that wouldn't take
[SPEAKER_00]: up very much room, but legally I cannot do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm limited to 12 here in the state of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I do if I wanted to grow a
bunch of stuff out, find the keepers,
[SPEAKER_00]: find the winners, and see what I've got?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in growing is about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to build a big stable of
keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to find just a few mommies for
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking to fill a greenhouse or a
commercial grow with a stable for a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical supply so that you can have a
bunch of strains on a shelf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking to become a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing for patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing for the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you growing for?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be the first question
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many moms do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different varietals do you
actually need around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you need so many?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ask questions because that makes
you think and then you can answer your own
[SPEAKER_00]: question for yourself and maybe figure
things out without me getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But always have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to find keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just trying to see what you made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not sure what the ultimate goal
here is, but what would I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would set a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the numbers of plants which
you are allowed to have, that would
[SPEAKER_00]: dictate how many seeds I pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were unlimited, I would pop as many
as I could possibly manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do hundreds, 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to do 500 seeds if I possibly
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your environment,
your situation, your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how brave you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to follow the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to break the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't encourage or promote you to do
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it were up to me, I would run a
bunch of small, small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I've got a tray that fits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working the commercial grows,
these little trays I would buy would hold
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 plants perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of those trays was basically 100
plants, 100 cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put beer cups in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I could grow 100 beer cups under one
small light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see a lot of stuff from a seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run 100 seeds from a line of seeds,
you will definitely see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: expression in that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you're going to cull about
50 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two trays that are gone right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're down to 48 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm down to my females because we're
going to eliminate the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to start seeing the
dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which phenotypes really express
themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the keepers, the not keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see if there are any sex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any weirdos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any standouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that you do notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you do love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you do hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to notice that within 100
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll definitely notice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would run 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then keep an eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're done, don't harvest
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave enough there to where you can re-veg
your favorite one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got that many seeds and
you see something in a pack of 100,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably going to be able to find
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the breeder, as the person that made
that pack, you could probably identify
[SPEAKER_00]: that one again in the future and be able
to find that keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you found one in 100, it is there
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to be super rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would pop a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hunt through those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would re-veg that keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would pop another 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep doing this until I found the
amount of plants which I needed to fill my
[SPEAKER_00]: stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, I'm allowed 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'd work on finding four or five
great mom plants and then start growing
[SPEAKER_00]: those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every so often, I'd run another pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've decided your number of
mother plants, we'll say five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we've got five good mom plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you run another pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of those seeds is better than the
five you've got, call the worst one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your five keepers and replace it with that
new girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got the five best all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hunt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would repeat and I would build a
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a bunch of small plants because
that way you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small plants that you can re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to do and it saves you all
that time and space of cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you clone, you basically double
your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: You double your workload.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got an unlimited plant count,
I would do a bunch of tester runs in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I do my testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I do them in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I vege them until they're a few inches
tall, depending on the strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flower for 70 days and we know what
we've got at the end of 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut them down, leave a little bit on the
bottom, re-vege them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to run it again, I've got that
plant for future use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to talk about is
it's really fun to run through a shit ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I just said I love to run through
500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see a lot of expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to learn a lot of shit about the
plants that you have made, but that's also
[SPEAKER_00]: like going on 500 dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to remember anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to know if you're really
interested in anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got 499 others distracting you
to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of info.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice may be, one of the options may
be to pick your favorite batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's getting your attention the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody out of all of the seeds you've
got is saying, grow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pack that you've been going,
I should grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow all of the phenotypes out of there to
the best of your ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then narrow it down to about five of your
favorite females out of that big
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got the best five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow those again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow those again, narrow it down
to your favorite two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to get harder the next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now narrow it down to your favorite one or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about instead of running 500 plants
and trying to find a bunch of keepers,
[SPEAKER_00]: why don't we run 50, 100 and find the one
keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really focus on some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a relationship with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to grow a lot of shit,
but how do you know that that plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with is reaching its
potential and showing you what it could
[SPEAKER_00]: really do if you're messing with 500 total
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got seven dates, you're not going
to know which girl was into strawberry ice
[SPEAKER_00]: cream, which girl was into vanilla ice
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be like, oh shit,
you got to take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't build any real relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you focus on one plant, one person,
you'll learn all the details, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: anomalies, all the ticks, all the things
that makes that plant shine, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that make that plant angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn that around week five,
if I give it a nice boost of potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn that if I over give it too
much Cal Mag around week seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll go fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to learn all these nuances
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you develop a relationship with one cut
and run it multiple times over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that doesn't sound as exciting as
running a bunch of seeds, but imagine what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do once you get one plant really
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you grow it, it'll be good,
but we're running 500 plants in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, same conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a solid chance to show us
what they can really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take a couple of plants and
learn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, maybe it wants
something special at week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it doesn't want something at week
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you make it colder at week seven,
it'll do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you make it really hot at week
nine, it does something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to learn these things about the
plants and the only way we learn that is
[SPEAKER_00]: by growing them over and over again and
seeing how they react to different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and different stressors,
different feedings, different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to try little different things
every time I grow because I've got a good
[SPEAKER_00]: grasp on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what my plants are going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if, what if I get it real,
real cold in here this season?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I get it real, real hot in here
this season?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I forget to water the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiments, that's where you learn the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you grow that plant several
times throughout the year, like I just
[SPEAKER_00]: said, maybe it gets real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it gets real cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This summer, it's going to hit like 112,
115 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, it gets to negative 17
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to keep my grow spaces dialed
in and evened out, but I'm fucking not
[SPEAKER_00]: there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gets a little bit cold in the
grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gets a little bit hotter in
the grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice differences in the performance of
different plants based on these anomalies
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grow room, which I failed to
control because of my outside
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes honestly, it's so cold outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't warm the grow room to be 80
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only get it to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's so hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't cool the grow room down to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only get it to 80 because it's so
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I really do see different
expressions from some of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also different light cycles, different
feed cycles, then different defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do or maybe do not pop it and twist
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different things do make a
difference to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the idea that you want to run
through a bunch of shit and find all the
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers, but also maybe you're missing
something by going so quickly through so
[SPEAKER_00]: many numbers and not spending time on that
one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that one right there that you keep
looking over because you've got 499
[SPEAKER_00]: others, maybe that one is the next fucking
Golden Chem, Gorilla, Cookie, Biscuit,
[SPEAKER_00]: Biscotti, what's the Diesel, Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to name all the popular shit,
but the Piff, whatever else is popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cake stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a new popular one and you don't
even know it because you haven't taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to dial it in and perfect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dial in each cultivar before you pass
them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if that strain sucks completely
the first time you grow it, you could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: as an experienced grower, as a
phenohunter, you could tell when something
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think it's a seven on the first
time you run it and you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: nines and tens, give it another run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you did something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring out the potential of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run a whole fucking bunch of
plants or I would slow my ass down and
[SPEAKER_00]: just run a few with the space and
resources I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself sane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep yourself a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend, I think I rambled on
for quite a while about that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered all of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I wanna get to know you better
through the servers.
