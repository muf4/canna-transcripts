you by my friend, Jost Defari.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Jost Defari for the backup
podcast intro track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of bananas,
foster, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love the bananas foster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of banana OG and Paris
Larry on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as banana,
sugar, and oatmeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one thing I forget about quite often
is that I love banana turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get an extra nice buzz from banana
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show this to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really beautiful concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fresh gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not taken a dab out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up and dabbing this all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second jar I've had to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just if you're going to call me out and
say, that's a fresh gram, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did finish one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do buy more than one when I go shopping,
especially when it's bananas fosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 84.43% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like we have covered all
of the business for the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the Patreon messages
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Patreon message of this episode
goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, I found you from
Jordan Rivers Growcast episode a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been listening and watching
religiously ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Jordan River
and the Growcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of things in my way
preventing me from getting Jordan on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan, if you're listening, it is time
that we schedule you to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes on to say, my wife and I
recently bought some orangegasm seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: we cannot wait to get them into the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several other iris strains that we want to
try as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to them in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and every time you catch up on
growing the iri genetic strains you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow, I'm going to put out more fire
that gets your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're never going to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a fun game for both of
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love your enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I love that your wife is included in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many guys exclude the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even mention the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for including the wife in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more women growers, more women
supporting us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behind every good grower is a good lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have a million questions to ask,
but as I'm unable to do the Patreon thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for now, I will keep it brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that you have to be a Patreon
contributor to get your email read on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a great question and it's
going to fit the format of the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: the timeframe in which I think I've got,
I will pull questions from the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: email and get them on the show like you're
seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one says, can you tell me how you
got started in the caregiver part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you find patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Must your herb be tested prior to being
patient taking it from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking into the caregiver licenses
here in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds very similar to what you
described for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a new grower having just harvested my
second solo run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the second solo run went well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said I help a couple of buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I help a couple of buddies with their
commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be invaluable experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything and anything they ask you
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it seems I don't suck at it,
but the folks who've been around when I
[SPEAKER_00]: share, they seem to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your second grow under your
belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'd love to hear your thoughts on
me looking to expand my grow capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get six mature plants per license
holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's touch on the main part of this
question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, when medical cannabis
started, we had what was called the
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people want to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people want to treat their ailments
with cannabis, but they do not have a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide themselves with the necessary
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're not physically able.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just don't care to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to find somewhere to get their
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries are an option, always were an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like going to a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be seen walking into
the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people simply cannot make it to the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way for people to obtain medical
cannabis in the Colorado market at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of this was through the
caregiver model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would find somebody who is able,
willing, and ready to grow a crop of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and provide it to that patient at
little or no cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no rule on the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was kind of a rule written that we
wouldn't profit from it, but we were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to charge you for our electricity,
the nutrients, our time, our energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: drying, trimming, curing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could put a price tag on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of caregivers did different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My price was kind of based on what you
were able to afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to smoke an ounce a month,
and I know that you're going to smoke an
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce a month and your budget was 140
bucks, you're going to get an ounce a
[SPEAKER_00]: month for 140 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were some young kid who was smoking
recreationally to be cool, and you smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: an ounce a month, but you had 300,
I was charging you 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: I based my scale based on your ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those younger kids that were
hustlers and doing their thing were paying
[SPEAKER_00]: for some of the other folks to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was how the medical cannabis was
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a caregiver, let me get myself back
on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I lost my train of thought
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a caregiver, somebody would find
somebody like me to grow that cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd say, hey, Jeff, I need cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need about this much a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the strains that you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use Mike as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was Mike's caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was my patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Mike went to the medical marijuana
doctor, and Mike, thanks for giving me
[SPEAKER_00]: permission to talk about this because he
didn't, and I'm just saying this hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: he's cool with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike went to the medical marijuana doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical marijuana doctor approved his
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the part of the medical marijuana
recommendation is a part that says,
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver or provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that spot, he wrote my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that paper made it to the state,
that gave the state the notification that
[SPEAKER_00]: I am allowed to grow Mike's medical
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each patient was allocated a certain
amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a state recommendation and the
doctor would finagle paperwork and give
[SPEAKER_00]: you extra plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike would make me, he would designate
me his caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I am Mike's caregiver,
I know that every couple of weeks or every
[SPEAKER_00]: week, Mike is going to need a half ounce
or an ounce of grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Mike's favorite fucking strain on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not grow enough grateful dog to
keep Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy, but as his caregiver, that was my
obligation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trusted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He relied on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would accept his a caregivership card.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would put my name on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd put my name on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd mail it to the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the police, God forbid, whatever you
believe in, if the law enforcement were to
[SPEAKER_00]: come to the house, they would say,
Hey, you've got too many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, no, I'm a medical
marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my paperwork for my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got Mike's plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the papers that say I can have
Mike's plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as his caregiver, I was responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was responsible for providing him with
quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also as a caregiver, I felt it was my
responsibility to counsel him on his
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike didn't need counseling, but there
were other people that did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed advice, education and guidance
on how to smoke, what to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: when to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that I felt were
my responsibility as their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a medical cannabis
caregiver, not like a health provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't taking them shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't doing their dishes and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was providing medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my job as a medical cannabis
caregiver was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would find people who were in need of
my service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I developed a reputation very quickly
around here as being a grower who could
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a lot of people requesting me as
their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had the advantage and the blessing
of being involved in the first dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that dispensary, we got shut down
because of zoning violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not in the right area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they shut down our building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries weren't around yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were making the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were breaking rules that weren't made
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the end coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see things, wheels turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that the end of our dispensary was
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I began giving people my phone number and
my business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, when this dispensary is gone,
I'll be looking for people to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That opportunity arose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to select people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the state of Colorado decided you can
only be a caregiver for so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were pushing the system, kind of
bending the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're allowed to have six plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I've got 50 people that I'm their
caregiver for, now I can have fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000 plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the math right there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six plants, 50 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that 300, 3,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, 300 people, 300 plants I could
put now in my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they limited us to how many people we
could be a caregiver for.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, they limited us to how many
plants we can have per household total.
[SPEAKER_00]: No love, no stretches, no breaks on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor can write you an extra card in
most communities, in most counties in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were allowed six medical marijuana
plants and six recreational plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get your 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more than that, you're going to be
asking for trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically how I got into
caregivership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a reputation for growing and people
knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been providing people with
black market cannabis, allegedly at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, which I don't think they can do
anything about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all alleged shit, but those people
knew my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it came time, they're like,
I want you to grow for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I was your caregiver,
you got first pick on my crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvested cherry widow, white rhino,
the flow, the fucking sour OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those came down, if I was your
caregiver, you got first pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other people in the hood got the
leftovers of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I find patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been around before medical cannabis
was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already had a reputation and I was
involved in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I found patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saved a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought some grow lights and I hung up
grow lights and I got some plants and I
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I practice just like you're doing,
just like you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got involved in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I developed a reputation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing grow lessons at grow
stores downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got involved and people found out
who I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I would go to the medical
marijuana doctor, I've got this big mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would end up teaching people about
medical cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd find new friends, new patients there
in a booming market, just creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation for yourself, create a vibe for
yourself, be approachable, create a
[SPEAKER_00]: business card, create a plan, have an
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what your name is on here,
but make a business plan around your
[SPEAKER_00]: business name, J&J's Caregiving Services
and build a reputation for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the dispensaries in your area are still
allowed to take in product over the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter, I'm not sure the rules there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, I could grow herb at home
or wherever and take it to the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can still do that, grow a product,
take it to the dispensary, tell them,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them your business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll develop a relationship with you
and want to get that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually people will find out who's
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll want to come directly to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this sounds weird, but Craigslist
was a huge way that people got caregiver
[SPEAKER_00]: popular in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caregiver clones was a real funny joke
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Craigslist clones was a big joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd find caregivers looking and selling
clones on Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how dangerous that is now,
but honestly, that's how a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement got started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd post your clones on Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd post caregiver services,
deliveries, all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that gray line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that line in that gray area and ride
the shit out of that and develop yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: a caregiver service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be creative, be original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, have a reliable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in it for the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that applies to everybody
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit trying to make it a fucking race.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you win the race, big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won the race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the fastest lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going for longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be in the fucking marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to be sweating for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have sprinted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have fucking threw your arms up
first and won today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm racing tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm racing the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back for the races next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit treating this industry like a fucking
sprint and be in this for the marathon,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we are going to make our industry a
sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to fall apart and big
corporations will take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quit sprinting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a horse race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend is looking into caregiver
licenses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get all of the licenses in
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a lawyer on retainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something people are going to
overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting into the legal cannabis
game, you're going to walk, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to straddle a fine line here between
what's legal and what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a lawyer on retainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw them some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a bag of money at your lawyer's
office to where when you fuck up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can reach into it and go, I need this
much of your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this, but we'll get you
out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be clear, open, and honest with your
lawyer about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're signing papers with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not going to snitch on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying him money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He almost needs you to almost have a
little bit of problems to keep money in
[SPEAKER_00]: his bank, but he doesn't want to snitch on
you to get you fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to keep you safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawyer is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to find patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create that reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cool with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next question is, must your herb
be lab tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately here in Colorado,
patients cannot get their quality product
[SPEAKER_00]: lab tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be marijuana enforcement division
regulated, which means you've got to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary grow to get your product lab
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason is there are not enough
labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labs are overwhelmed and backed up
with commercial grow products or personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said, we don't even have time
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, if the facility is not
marijuana enforcement division regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: and more than enough people drop off
samples today, and that collection
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is in possession of more grams
than what their license allows,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are now in possession of an illegal
amount of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to get 114 grams tested today
and so did you, and they're a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: limit because they're not a marijuana
enforcement division regulated facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowed to have up to two ounces
of product depending on their,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can have two ounces I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as they pass two ounces of
product, they're now illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't have two ounces of weed in the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breaking all kinds of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't receive your samples to test
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a loophole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this in hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a hypothetical situation that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a large hemp industry here in
Colorado and your hemp must be tested to
[SPEAKER_00]: verify that it is not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot meaning it is over 0.03% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got too much THC in it,
that is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be labeled cannabis or destroyed
because that is not a sellable hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is now weed, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally differently regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your crop is no good as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have all of our hemp tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to stop a grower from
taking his crop to a hemp testing facility
[SPEAKER_00]: and having them test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad thing that happens is they give
you back a paper that says you have failed
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hemp does not have less than 3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like 24% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hemp is no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to look at the guy with
a straight face and go, I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what I did wrong with my hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to go home and you go,
I got a 23% test on my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody that I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't tell the people at the
lab that that is your intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there acting like you're testing
your hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you find out that your hemp
is amazingly high in THC, be shocked,
[SPEAKER_00]: act appalled, and then go home and call
your friends and celebrate and post the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab results to social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the way to get your stuff
tested in a Colorado market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the availability of testing
in the Oklahoma market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are products they are selling that
allegedly will test your product at home
[SPEAKER_00]: on site with your phone and this little
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of people that claim it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are involved with that company that
makes a homemade cannabis lab testing kit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an awesome product, I'll give you
an amazing fucking review.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your product isn't as impressive as you
claim, you might not want to send me one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are from the PRPL company that
makes the lab testing equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: here is my official request.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try it out on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's awesome, you'll get a lot of free
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me one of those fuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about it on the show a lot,
a lot, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to PRPL.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody can link me up with PRPL,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get myself back on track or this
is going to be a really long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get into caregiving by creating that
reputation, building relationships,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are patients that need a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a caregiver that needs patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about finding those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about putting yourself in the
right spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, your industry is booming where
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the events, go meet the people,
go show off your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, if you've got the good product,
people will be banging down your door to
[SPEAKER_00]: get signed up for you to be their
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear your thoughts on me
looking to expand my grow capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more caregiver cards you have,
the more plants you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that just because you're
growing more plants doesn't mean you got
[SPEAKER_00]: more herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people relying on you for that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can move a little bit more of
it, but you do have those people gave you
[SPEAKER_00]: their rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've given away their grow rights to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relying on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trusting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a quality, safe, clean product,
and don't profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to cover the lights, the
nutrients, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get rich off these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very important that you don't focus
on making a lot of money off the people
[SPEAKER_00]: you're caregiving for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they are well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they are provided for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they've got the strains that
they need for their medical ailments or
[SPEAKER_00]: their conditions, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to make some profit,
make that profit off of those black market
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I had some older
patients that were on a fixed income,
[SPEAKER_00]: not making a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure they got the medicine they
needed for the budget that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if they didn't have the budget,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They still got the medicine and those
younger guys that park out front,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the music up too loud, leave their
girlfriend in the car, run in,
[SPEAKER_00]: run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They covered the extra cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn how to balance that economy
so that your pocket doesn't dwindle and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody feels like they're getting slighted
in your cannabis endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else am I in this message?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two more quick things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says your lapel mic is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I felt the lapel mic was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listened to a couple of those
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the boom that this mic
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stick with this mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this one better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that I looked more freed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more free, but this microphone here
is comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put my arm on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could grab the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught myself reaching for the mic that
wasn't there when I had the lapel mic on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the lapel mic is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boom mic has a much wider frequency
response and sounds much better to my
[SPEAKER_00]: ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play bass with some other local
musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that for what you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lost all credibility at the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my job to pick on the bass player.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a band as well was in a band as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's like picking on other
musicians, the bass player.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many fucking bass player
jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the bass players.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drums and the bass are the king of the
dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your observation and assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mic does provide a much boomier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the God mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm on zoom videos with other people
and they're using like iPhone fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: lapel mics and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hello, it's God.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mic will overpower all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just talk right over anybody if I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do love this mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is much more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says take that for what you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it that I should stick with
this mic and only use the lapel mic in
[SPEAKER_00]: other environments and situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I liked the last part of your
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, It says lastly park Mike right in
front of a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't back away from the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he is prone to do the dude has some
great stuff when we can hear him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good fucking way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the mic right in front of Mike and
put a wall back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't keep leaning back off the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't miss stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's saying that is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Mike lives at a different
spot and I can't really control where the
[SPEAKER_00]: walls are, but I will make sure that Mike
gets his mic adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the levels on Mike a little more
appropriate because the dude does have
[SPEAKER_00]: some great shit to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got him writing a full episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been focusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I haven't seen him for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been focusing on writing his own
podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to highlight Mike on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when he's on here, I do over-talk
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do kind of, I'm trying to steer a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give him his opportunity, but sometimes
I'm like, you've been going for six
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go a different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's drive the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to cut them off, but I'm going
to give him the opportunity to do
[SPEAKER_00]: basically his own show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there driving the show,
but I'm just going to kind of stay out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way and let him talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does have some great shit to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he does have some great shit to say,
he's going to be your hero.
But I'm just going to make sure that
whatever we do, our guests are listening
and if we can get that, and he's going to
be listening and we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that done within when we can hear him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike, uh, stay on the mic, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we need to get Mike a new mic,
I may check out one of those yeti blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mics or one of those other mics pretty
soon for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want them to be heard,
but thank you for the guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, uh, stay safe and stay ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you want your name said,
uh, it's from a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Jay and Jay, thank you for
the great message and good luck on your
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I hope things go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need any more, if you have specific
questions, reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more guidance, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more than happy to help you jump into
the caregiver game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all my friends out there in
Oklahoma, making a new industry fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already like 20 something minutes
into this episode, but we ain't got
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's on quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still Pandy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from our friend Basta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question for you about VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently purchased the Pulse monitor and
I want to get my grow tent in perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a four by eight gorilla grow
tent with two HLG five fifties and UV
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does VPD matter at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what is recommended during
lights on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend the best VPD and
also any tips, any tips on achieving this
[SPEAKER_00]: number?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started five, 10 gallons with lemon
Jeffrey and I'll post pics as I go on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the help, sir, from Basta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signed it with hashtag I re
army big up to the I re army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Basta.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question asking about VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently grabbed a Pulse monitor,
which will tell you the VPD, the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, the humidity will give you a
lot of great feedback on that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he wants to get it in perfect
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like he's got enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to know if the VPD is going to
matter at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what do I recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like monitors, but the plants are
the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants look happy, give them what
makes them look happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a VPD chart that will show you
standard ideas of where to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get the temperature at a
certain range, you can adjust the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get the humidity at a certain
range, or if the humidity is able to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: at a certain range, adjust the temperature
to go to that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what works for your
environment and your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monitors are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information is fucking wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keeping an eye on the plants is the
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you want numbers, you want
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you ideas of my VPD
and my temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're running during the day,
what is making the plants happy during the
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend running about five to 10
degrees cooler during your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VPD does matter during the night cycle
just as much during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overlook that nighttime VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need that VPD during the night
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature, I would say five to 10
degrees cooler than your daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 15 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't hit that 20 degree
temperature swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running at 80 degrees during
the day and the plants look happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75, 70 degrees at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go more than 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five to 10 degree temperature swing and
your diurnal swing is going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For humidity, I would follow the same
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: About five to 10% more humid at night
would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not go more than 10 to 20%
difference in our humidity in our night
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five to 10%, maybe 10 to 20% maximum
difference in our daytime and nighttime
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact VPD number that
you're going to want to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be challenging to get the
exact VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either your temperature or your humidity
are going to be kind of set based on your
[SPEAKER_00]: room and where the grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is going to be hard to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Match the other one with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a VPD chart, it'll show you
when the humidity is here, you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the temperature is here, you want the
humidity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find where you can make that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are curling up, it's too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are getting kind of brittle
and skinny, it's too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're starting to droop and hang,
it could be a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are always the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you want to get things dialed
in and I wish that I had a better number
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at a VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where your temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where your humidity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: See which one you can correct and get
right where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you're matching up with something
on there, getting a value which you think
[SPEAKER_00]: will work for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then look at the plants and see how they
are reacting to the values.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't know what numbers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got that room dialed in,
you can use the monitor to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: your VPD is where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let the plants tell you what they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use the monitor to get it there and
keep it there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also any tips on achieving the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plants and then set the
equipment accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a humidifier and a
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use all of the equipment appropriately and
you're just going to have to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to increase or reduce your
intake and outtake of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff depends on where the
room is, what the environment is in which
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that grow room really hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that grow room really cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that grow room really dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to work with what
you've got and you're going to have to let
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants dictate what they need from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you expected a specific VPD number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to give you a number to
try to strive for because I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're starting with and I don't want
to make you struggle to get to something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not even attainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if you've got any more specific
questions and I can help you out any
[SPEAKER_00]: better with any more info, you know I
would love to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a big part of the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Bafsta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I kind of left you in the dark
and said watch the plants and let the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants tell you the VPD and then use the
meters to keep that constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meters are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the fucking rulers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell us what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We become slaves to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got time for for
this episode.
