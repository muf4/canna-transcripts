[SPEAKER_00]: and easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright I don't have anything to ramble
about here at the start of the show let's
[SPEAKER_00]: jump right into a discussion about foliar
feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is foliar feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar feeding is spraying our plants with
a nutrient solution to provide nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right sometimes we can't water the
plants sometimes it's not necessary to
[SPEAKER_00]: water the plant sometimes there are no
roots to water so we foliar feed that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to give it nutrients to give it life
to give it sustenance to keep it green
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous lush and healthy throughout its
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things we would foliar feed
our plants and very commonly fed things
[SPEAKER_00]: are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen and calcium I tried to combine
that into one word that has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: invented yet it is still nitrogen and
calcium also many micronutrients are good
[SPEAKER_00]: for foliar feeding we can foliar feed a
lot of things the most important part
[SPEAKER_00]: about foliar feeding I shouldn't say the
most one of the most important a big
[SPEAKER_00]: important part is to have a strategy have
a goal why are you foliar feeding what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant deficient and what are you
trying to boost up a little bit have a
[SPEAKER_00]: timing a strategy a rhyme and a reason for
it or it can go terribly wrong but it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a great booster it can be a great
corrector it can be a very useful tool in
[SPEAKER_00]: our arsenal as a grower so let's talk
about foliar feeding I just mentioned why
[SPEAKER_00]: would we foliar feed some plants I've got
a very good example of why I foliar fed
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants just recently I recently
bought a new batch of soil supplies are
[SPEAKER_00]: limited we are in this weird pandemic
still things are not arriving at the
[SPEAKER_00]: stores like we would hope and expect them
to for a small grow project I bought a new
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of soil I've never used and honestly
it does not drain well it needs more
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration it needs more fluff to it I
should have mixed that in before I got the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in there however I did not realize
it I thought it would work when I watered
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants that soilless mix really
crushed down on those plants the roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of suffocated they're not happy with
me they're not growing as well as they
[SPEAKER_00]: could be and most importantly they're not
drying at the rate that I would hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: size of a pot with that much water would
dry now those plants still need nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to feed them but I can't give them
nutrients in the root zone because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: already soaked already saturated I want
that to dry up that's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: probably two or three watering cycles
before it actually does get watered again
[SPEAKER_00]: so at this time to provide nutrients for
those freshly transplanted plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: stubborn that are kind of not wanting to
grow they are getting foliar fed they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting their nitrogen their calcium a
couple other base nutrients are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: through a foliar feeding so that's one
reason why I am feeding the plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliar feed I'm gonna let them dry
keep hitting them with that foliar feed
[SPEAKER_00]: until they are ready for a nutrient feed I
won't overdo it I will pay close attention
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about dosing them the nutrient
amount here in just a moment I'm paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to my notes to make sure I
didn't get off track because I already got
[SPEAKER_00]: off track there we go so foliar feed
clones we often foliar feed our clones
[SPEAKER_00]: when I cut clones they don't have roots
when you cut clones they start off with no
[SPEAKER_00]: roots how do we feed them we feed them
through that humidity dome through the the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in the room also I'll take off
that dome and hit them straight with a
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer and foliar feed them with as light
nutrient solution that is technically
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feeding those plants so the clones
always take a good foliar another reason
[SPEAKER_00]: to foliar feed our plants is to provide a
specific nutrient to a specific plant in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room maybe you've got a hydroponic setup
or an ebb and flow setups where all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are getting fed the same thing
maybe one plant and there is stubborn
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it wants a little bit more maybe
it's hungry maybe it needs extra nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it needs extra phosphorus maybe it
needs extra calm egg what we can do is we
[SPEAKER_00]: can mix up those nutrients in a foliar
solution and apply it to that one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: directly through a foliar application
instead of trying to boost up all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: feed and the entire hydroponic system or
aquaponic system or whatever we can feed
[SPEAKER_00]: that one stubborn plant that Congo plant
in the corner that wants more food than
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that golden goat plant that eats
extra we can feed it without overfeeding
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of our plants now let's talk
about the actual act of foliar feeding our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants we know a little bit about what to
feed I told you definitely have a reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why you were foliar feeding you can use
the foliar feed to correct you can use it
[SPEAKER_00]: to boost you can use it as a regular feed
but have a strategy and a reason and when
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it write it down I will mention
that again later let's talk about actually
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feeding we know why we know what to
feed it let's talk about doing the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: task usually you're going to I would
recommend spraying most of our sprays are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen in the early stage or
early flower I recommended not spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky buds unless you've got a very good
reason chunky buds do not need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed if you've got bugs if you've got
problems if you're trying to boost it up
[SPEAKER_00]: find a better solution if you are getting
big chunky nuggets anytime past like week
[SPEAKER_00]: three day 21 is usually the last time I
will spray unless it's highly necessary I
[SPEAKER_00]: will hit the plants at day 21 of flower
they're starting to set those good bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sets give them one good final foliar feed
one good final pesticide rinse and hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that that lasts you for the next six or
seven weeks to get you to harvest so don't
[SPEAKER_00]: spray chunky buds if you've got to spray
buds that are developing remember those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds do have trichomes on the outside that
act like a water repellent as a UV
[SPEAKER_00]: protectant I think the UV anyway let's get
back on track the trichomes will protect
[SPEAKER_00]: from a little bit of water the plants are
going to be okay with a mist but we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to saturate the buds that are they're
spongy think about all the they're spongy
[SPEAKER_00]: if you squeeze them and let them go
there's a lot of moisture in there they
[SPEAKER_00]: can hold a lot of water don't create a
problem for your chunky buds do not spray
[SPEAKER_00]: them the next thing I've got on my notes
is avoid horticultural and botanical oils
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you are going to make
concentrates out of your products all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those oils will end up in your concentrate
if they don't evaporate dissipate or get
[SPEAKER_00]: washed off in some other manner they're
going to end up in your flowers and your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates have you ever gone to the
dispensary or even bought herb from a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend or a regular person that you know
somewhere they just sold you some herb and
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke it it's got like a minty flavor
or sort of a an aftershave sort of flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: or something that is probably from some of
the funky oils that they applied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to prevent powdery mildew or other
molds or pest problems so don't spray your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with oils I especially do not like
neem oil I don't like peppermint rosemary
[SPEAKER_00]: none of that hippie oil if you're going to
use that for your hippie magic do that but
[SPEAKER_00]: not on the plants please it's going to
make the plants taste like shit if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever I've been in the room or been
involved in concentrate making of all
[SPEAKER_00]: different types when you're making bh o
concentrates you can see some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and oils float to the top
there's your concentrate your crystals at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom the liquid in the middle the
turps at the top and then that funky layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of frothy shit that's the shit you should
not have sprayed on there that's your
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides your contaminants possibly a
surfactant that's a lot of shit that could
[SPEAKER_00]: have been in there so if you're making
concentrates don't spray it and also don't
[SPEAKER_00]: spray your flowers with funky shit now
let's talk about foliar feeding a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more in depth go light when you are
foliar feeding you're applying this
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to the leaves we don't need that
if it says apply 100 only apply about 15
[SPEAKER_00]: to 25 remember you can spray more but you
can't unspray those nutrients if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: some burn some leaf curl some leaf damage
that is because you sprayed too hard or my
[SPEAKER_00]: next note you possibly sprayed with the
lights on turn the lights off foliar feed
[SPEAKER_00]: or spray wait for the foliar feed to
completely turn the fans off as well turn
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights and the fans off apply your
foliar feed wait for that to dry then turn
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights back on if you spray with the
lights on remember when you were a kid a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of boys did this you girls won't know
what I'm talking about probably when we
[SPEAKER_00]: were a kid we would get a magnifying glass
and you could burn ants or you could catch
[SPEAKER_00]: paper on fire with the magnifying glass by
using the sun and that bubble angle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and you could focus that light on a
piece of paper or possibly the ants if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're creepy and you could catch some
shit on fire I think that that bubble that
[SPEAKER_00]: is on your leaf surface acts with the grow
light and it will make the same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: burn on your plants we will get or also we
can potentially get some phyto toxicity
[SPEAKER_00]: from the light and the heat interacting
with some foliar feeds especially oily
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides so my advice spray a light
solution of foliar feed if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients go lightly and also spray always
in the dark with the lights off don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow lights on the light above me like
the little LED light lighting up the room
[SPEAKER_00]: that is cool but your grow lights turn
those off any high-intensity lighting for
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow turn that off your normal room
lights you could see and work that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: just fine but we don't want the big grow
lights the big bright shit turn that off
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want to get problems on the
plants all right also I said a moment ago
[SPEAKER_00]: that using a surfactant will pop up in our
concentrates oftentimes if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray something it is a good idea to use a
surfactant that is something to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about that is a sticker and a spreader
something you would mix in with your
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feed I use this with a pesticide
with the foliar feed quite often in veg I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't do this past the late veg stage
because this may pop up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates but something to spread and
stick this application to the leaves they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell products dish soap is acceptable
cocoa wet is acceptable there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great things that will work as a
surfactant if you'd feel like you need it
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it to make the product stick and go
further because oftentimes I'm working in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial grow and every little bit
helps I think it'll really help if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a small grow it may not do a big
difference but I think it helps all right
[SPEAKER_00]: um also don't spray that too late don't go
after week three or week two a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: don't use your surfactants any sort of
oils anything like that it's best not to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray at all I understand shit happens you
may have to do some stuff I get it adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust save the crop all right when we are
foliar feeding I would recommend a pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: around seven adjust the pH of your foliar
feed to about seven six eight seven two
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere around there is gonna be good
seven will work the best to not burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and achieve best nutrient
absorption depending on the nutrients you
[SPEAKER_00]: are applying to these plants that's also
gonna matter a lot all right let's keep
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward spray the plant starting at
the bottom and work your way up this is
[SPEAKER_00]: standard horticultural spraying practice
my tongue is not liking the word
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural today I don't know why but
when we are applying pesticides or a
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feed to the plants start at the
bottom the bottom inside of the plant work
[SPEAKER_00]: your way out and up so kind of worked in
the middle spray out toward the outer edge
[SPEAKER_00]: then work your way up the plant lifting
the leaves as you go a little bit getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the leaves and that also
gets the top of the leaves that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed you'll get the whole thing
something to think about I like to spray a
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feed on the top of the leaf and a
pesticide on the bottom of the leaf is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of how I focus if I'm hitting it hard
I will coat that entire fucking plant just
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure there are no bugs in there
just depends on what the goal is but rule
[SPEAKER_00]: of thumb kind of in general pesticides on
the bottom foliar feed on the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf if you're trying to be economical
cost-effective that's the best way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it so spray at the bottom work your way up
don't overspray with a foliar feed but
[SPEAKER_00]: coat and soak the leaves or don't
overspray that's what I said we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: it running off and draining off you don't
want the outer edge of the plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground to look like it was raining you
want to maybe look like it got misted
[SPEAKER_00]: there a little bit don't waste your
pesticides don't overspray if you
[SPEAKER_00]: overspray you risk the potential of all
that spray running right off of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you want it to be on there the
smaller the bubbles the better if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get super small bubbles to spray on your
plants the better the plants will absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: more that way they'll get more of the if
it's a foliar feed or a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application they will get the best with
the smaller bubbles I'm making sure I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: following my notes here spray the top
bottom for bugs always write down what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've sprayed write down what you sprayed
exactly how much of it you sprayed when
[SPEAKER_00]: you sprayed it the date every plant that
got sprayed in a commercial environment I
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this a lot you've already heard
this in a commercial environment we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to write down what we sprayed our license
number the EPA number of the product we
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed what time we applied it how much
of it we used per gallon of water how many
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of water were applied to the room
which plants were sprayed we're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to write down either like all plants in
room a which is how we used to do it or
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant tag numbers but you've got to
write down a lot of information the time
[SPEAKER_00]: the date the re-entry time all of that
stuff is going to be written down I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you write that down now just get
yourself in the habit of writing that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff down now while you're writing down
what you foliar sprayed maybe consider
[SPEAKER_00]: writing down what you were trying to
correct what was your reason for spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular mix why did you mix up
this much of your base nutrients and a
[SPEAKER_00]: dash of cow mag and spray that on your
plants today what was your goal did you
[SPEAKER_00]: see something wrong or were you trying to
boost them were you just trying to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little push we'll talk about push
in a moment because that's one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite foliar feeding products also I
feed what's the other one liquid karma and
[SPEAKER_00]: push are my two favorites to foliar feed
also you'll see me foliar feed a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cow mag but let's keep going I recommend a
pump sprayer they sell pump sprayers and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different sizes you don't want to
be in there with a little spray bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're doing the windows that will
kill your wrist if you've got more than
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant your wrist is going to die
invest in the appropriate size pump
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer to get the best application you
can those little deck sprayers or
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide sprayers that they sell at your
local hardware shop if you've got a small
[SPEAKER_00]: mom and pop shop I recommend you go there
if not they've got them at the orange box
[SPEAKER_00]: shop or the blue box shop that Home Depot
and Lowe's has got you covered get one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those pump sprayers it's like a gallon
maybe two gallons of water you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill it you can put one gallon in there
put enough nutrients to foliar feed one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon do your feeding application and
then clean it out don't leave that pump
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer sitting there with old pesticides
old nutrients in there it's gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy it will get funky then you're gonna
apply mold to your plants the next time
[SPEAKER_00]: you use it take care of your shit buy it
one time clean it every time you use it it
[SPEAKER_00]: should last quite a while the rings on
there stay well a little note when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: buying those pump sprayers this is fucking
random it will help you out I prefer the
[SPEAKER_00]: pump sprayer that has a pressure release
valve let's let's talk about what's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen we're going to get a pump sprayer
you're gonna put the amount of water which
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd like to put in there one or two
gallons maybe less maybe more we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to add our nutrients our pesticide then
we're going to put our surfactant then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to pH it there we're gonna
shake the shit out of it that's one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to always think about when using any sort
of spray application shake it make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got that emulsified in that
container so you're not just applying like
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if the Kool-Aid was real thick at
the bottom and you just drink the top half
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be mad when everybody got to the
bottom without you so mix it up real good
[SPEAKER_00]: shake the shit out of it then we're gonna
pump it real good 25 pumps or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that on the big ones 12 or something
pumps on the little ones is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: recommends on the label so we're gonna
pump it to where it's gonna have good
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure to spray real hard at this point
I recommend you've already got gloves and
[SPEAKER_00]: goggles on we should have mentioned that
before always wear your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment when mixing shaking
applying messing with the pesticides or
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliar feeds you can get in your eye
it's gonna suck wear your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment that's a note from
Ross to Jeff so we're gonna shake it up
[SPEAKER_00]: right shake the shit out of it shake shake
shake it up baby now then we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: spray the plants now it's time to clean
our sprayer but we didn't use all the
[SPEAKER_00]: charge from the pump and I want to let off
that pressure but I don't want to stand
[SPEAKER_00]: there and spray my pesticide or my foliar
feed in the air because the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed I don't want to spray it into the
toilet down the drain what am I gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: to let that pressure off I like a spray
bottle or a sprayer that's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure release valve so that when I
unscrew that top valve it doesn't blast
[SPEAKER_00]: off into my face you can simply let some
of the pressure off unscrew it and not
[SPEAKER_00]: break your pump sprayer I think it'll make
it last longer they're not much more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive so I think it will be worth the
small investment you can find those I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend always go to a local mom-and-pop
shop that's the way we should do it
[SPEAKER_00]: support mom-and-pop support local shops if
you don't support them when you do need
[SPEAKER_00]: them they won't be there they'll tell you
order from Amazon bro and then Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have any advice or guidance so go
to the mom-and-pop shop help them out
[SPEAKER_00]: their guidance and advice their
interaction will be worth the extra couple
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks again if they're not available hit
that lows the Home Depot they've always
[SPEAKER_00]: got sprayers over in the the pesticide
area they've got that big gross pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: section there you can find some useful
things pick up a package of mosquito dunks
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're there I just did the day
letterman fucking Johnny Carson phone
[SPEAKER_00]: pinpoint I call this a phone also that
fucking that's a brain injury but there we
[SPEAKER_00]: go get some skeeter dunks while you're
there that's a presidential point if I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen when the Obama point mosquito
dunks come in handy for a lot of things we
[SPEAKER_00]: can mix those up in our regular feed and
put those in the water and get rid of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of basic soil borne pests let me get
back on track get yourself a good sprayer
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're at the store there get some
skeeter dunks they're good for you get
[SPEAKER_00]: something that makes small bubbles I don't
necessarily use a fogger but get something
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes the best small bubbles you can
find and again use a mask and goggles and
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves when you're doing any sort of spray
application remember if you put any
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in here let's talk about this
you can foliar feed and apply a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application at the same time I've
mentioned this a couple of times before my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite foliar feeding product is push
that is from the veg bloom company which
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually hydroponic research calm it's
hydroponic dash research calm to the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of my recollection that is where I
remember finding that and buying that
[SPEAKER_00]: things change on the internet that may be
totally different by now but push from the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that make veg bloom is a great
product I will add push in with other
[SPEAKER_00]: products and pesticides it would not be
uncommon for me to add push cow mag and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of evergreen and possibly one
more pesticide let's just pick one I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to even imagine I don't have my notes
in front of me we'd pick another pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: and mix it right on in there so you're
getting your cow mag fixed you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: a good push of a boost and you're getting
two pesticide applications at once
[SPEAKER_00]: attacking from multiple angles to get rid
of those pests that is okay to do in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience maybe mix small batches before
you go hard and spray everything and test
[SPEAKER_00]: it out but in most of my experience I can
mix pesticides and foliar feeds at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time when you're doing that personal
protective equipment I keep saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's on my notes here in capital bold
letters PPE I don't want to be the one
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for getting you sick or
injured I want to make sure you set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success part of success is
setting yourself up for the long run by
[SPEAKER_00]: taking good care of yourself with personal
protective equipment all right there will
[SPEAKER_00]: be a humidity spike after any sort of
spray be prepared for that keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: that on your equipment maybe learn to
adjust the fans and the blowers to take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of that humidity spike also you may
have to dump the humidifier early because
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be more water in the air I've
said this before if there are no buds your
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide and foliar applications will be
just fine if you do have buds spray
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly only spray if you've got a reason
don't just spray because it's fun because
[SPEAKER_00]: you heard of a foliar application idea
that looked cool spray with purpose and
[SPEAKER_00]: intent or it will cause problems but it
can correct a lot of things you're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying nutrients directly to the leaf
where you see an issue you'll be amazed at
[SPEAKER_00]: how quickly if you've got a light issue so
if those spider mites have been sucking
[SPEAKER_00]: the life out of your plants put a touch of
base nutrients in with your pesticide your
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mite spray I'm gonna say evergreen
and a little bit of cow mag and a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of base nutrients together after a
spider mite infestation you'll be wiping
[SPEAKER_00]: out the bugs and replenishing the
nutrients at the same time you'll go in
[SPEAKER_00]: and the leaves won't be green or yellow
and funky they'll be green and healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: again it'll be amazing all right I'm going
over the notes making sure I covered all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the notes on the iPad then we're gonna
stare at the computer paper here for a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment make sure we got all of those this
question was inspired by my friend green
[SPEAKER_00]: vet 88224 who did send me a question that
I just skipped right over because I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to get right to the topic the leaves can
take the nutrients helps move immobile
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients you can feed while the roots are
saturated what else did I write you can
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeed so be careful it's a good way to
get pesticides and push products together
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't over spray your buds it looks
like I have covered all of my notes ladies
[SPEAKER_00]: and gentlemen boys girls pimps hoes
