[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 370 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I've been smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of strawberry
diesel ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells like like skunky
strawberries and just funky fruit and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you dab it at a nice low temperature,
it tastes like strawberries and cream with
[SPEAKER_00]: a hint of skunky gassiness in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like eating some strawberry
shortcake at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it kind of smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab test on the front here says 72.3%
THC with a total cannabinoid content of
[SPEAKER_00]: 83.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is great and the texture and
consistency are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just enough terp sauce in here and
it's got some nice chunky crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really happy with that purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrate from our friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my next order of business is to
give a couple of people some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Brett
Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant shout out to Riley
Hansen, a big shout out to Mike O'Panther,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big thank you shout out to Sam and also
a giant fist bump and a shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the continued Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, this is going to
be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That series starts at episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this series of lessons, we started by
setting a goal for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we decided a good place for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we acquired the appropriate equipment
and set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we either acquired seeds or clones
and we got those growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in my grow lessons,
we should have small plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 8 to 12 inches tall and they
are in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably in either beer cups or
four inch pots or maybe six or eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be nice and healthy at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have nice branching coming out
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should not have any bugs or any
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully at this point, we don't have any
burned leaves or any signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we have got a nice developed
thriving root system to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if most of those things are accurate,
we've got a nice healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a nice healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to transplant our small plants
into our larger pot, our finishing pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and start the large veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these plants will probably finish out
in these pots unless you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant one more time into an even
larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go from the small pot into my
finishing pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm generally going to go into a three
gallon or a five gallon or a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: in an indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may choose to go larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to go from the small six inch
net pot, maybe to a one gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe into your 20 or 30 gallon,
if you're going to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked in a previous episode about why
it's a good idea to use a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: container for smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to water this giant area
when we've got a tiny plant right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to go to like a 20 or
30 gallon pot, you may want to go from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup to maybe a one gallon, maybe a three
gallon, then later on transplant that into
[SPEAKER_00]: your 20 or 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets challenging when you go to
transplant larger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not experienced with it,
you can cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to lay that larger plant on its
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to remove that pot, then you need
to pot a much larger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get difficult, but I have faith in
you that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to transplant twice,
just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we're going to focus on
transplanting one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go from this small beer cup
or our four inch or our six inch net pot
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe an eight inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to pot into a three or a
five or a seven gallon pot for my example.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about pots and
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a long episode about choosing pots
and soil, but let's do a brief recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the plastic nursery pots in
a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, I like to use a
root pot, one of the fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most applications, I am using a three
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use whatever kind of pots make you
happy as long as it's going to get you to
[SPEAKER_00]: your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I find most important is to make
sure that whatever container you use,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has plenty of holes for drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that when you water this plant,
the excess water has some way to escape
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bottom of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nursery pots have plenty of holes in
them already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fabric pots will drain naturally just
because they're mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use a Home Depot bucket
or something like that, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: drill plenty of drainage holes in your
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about soil or
soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy a really expensive
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to feed your plants with
bottled nutrients, you can buy an inert
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a soil or soilless mix with
a lot of nutrients and a lot of stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be on top of fertilizing
these plants with your bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to pay extra money for a
soil or a soilless mix that's got a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give us the opportunity to burn
our plants because we're going to add them
[SPEAKER_00]: to a soil that's got nutrients in it,
then we're going to add bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do run the risk of over-fertilizing the
plants in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really need an over-fertilized
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need something more inert, maybe
something with some mycos or some
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be advantageous, but we don't
really need a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever medium you choose to purchase,
I recommend you get something with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of aeration in it, either a lot of perlite
or a lot of persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't come with plenty of aeration
product already in it, buy a bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite and amend it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the amount of perlite or persolite
you're going to need to add to your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or soilless mix will depend on the
fluffiness and the amount of aeration in
[SPEAKER_00]: that medium when you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're going to
purchase, so I'm not sure what to
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend as a ratio of how much perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm working with cocoa, I mix three
bags of cocoa and one five-gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: of perlite and one five-gallon bucket of
persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that gives me about 25 to 30
three-gallon pots worth of material to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can reduce that recipe as needed
for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I were working with soil or a
soilless mix, I might not use as much
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may reduce that perlite by about half.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I don't need as much
aeration in soil and soilless mix as I do
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the cocoa holds a lot more
water, so it also pushes out a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: air and it kind of crushes the plants a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets heavier because it's got so much
water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil and soilless mix doesn't hold as
much water, so it doesn't get as heavy and
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't crush the roots as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need as much perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go half as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're doing three bags of soil,
do half of a five-gallon bucket of
[SPEAKER_00]: persolite and half of a five-gallon bucket
of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys aren't going to buy the
persolite, I understand it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another product to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get by with just using perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite is just fine for this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only want to buy the one product,
that will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three bags of soil and maybe one bag of
perlite for this application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I work in larger batches than a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to reduce this recipe for a
smaller garden, I think they sell the bags
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil in 1.75 cubic yards is what I
think most of those bags of dirt are,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least the bags of cocoa I was buying
are 1.77 cubic yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy 1.77 cubic yards of dirt,
mix that with a third of a five-gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just fill the bucket up about a third,
maybe halfway if you want to go hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mix that in really well with your
soil so that it's nicely even,
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly mixed in there with everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you just see the little white
spots everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know you've got plenty of
aeration throughout your entire root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while we're mixing up perlite into our
soil, why not mix in some sort of root
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant powder?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I talked all about
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add a mycorrhizae product to our mix
right now and get it distributed all
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like the great white granulars
would work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use great white shark on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sprinkle it in there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use Plus Life right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of powdered myco product would
work wonderfully right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle it right into the dirt as you're
mixing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that's a great way to segue
into actually starting to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well aerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put a myco product in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's actually get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step number one, you guys, is always find
the Bluetooth speaker and put on the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you grow, it makes the plants
happy, and it puts you in a good mood to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a positive garden environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step number one, find the Bluetooth
speaker or find your earbuds, get your
[SPEAKER_00]: earbuds in, get hooked up with the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to make your garden grow so
much more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you grow more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make everything go better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step number one, find the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, get it at an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable volume and get that going in
the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step number two, get some rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often overlook this step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should always be wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're coming in contact with mycos,
if we're coming in contact with the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're coming in contact with bottled
nutrients, we should be wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're going to be sprinkling
those myco products over your top soil
[SPEAKER_00]: just all willy nilly, maybe you might want
to consider some sort of a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really want to breathe in micro
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the podcast on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gloved up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a face mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your dreadlocks tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're nicely medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's appropriate wherever you work or
wherever you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's actually get to business here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fill our container,
whatever size container we chose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fill it with our well mixed
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we've got a bunch of perlite in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we added a myco product to
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's ready to go into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to fill my containers by using a
smaller container just to scoop dirt out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bag or whatever container it's in
and just dump it right into the pot that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it up most of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're filling up a three gallon,
five gallon or seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill it up most of the way, but leave
yourself about an inch and a half or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: two inches at the top where you don't fill
it all the way up, all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave yourself about inch and a half,
two inches so that when we water,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got some room to put water in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to pour water on the pot
and watch it run right off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have to stand there and
pour water really slowly to where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get that whole quarter or half or gallon
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be able to just splash a gallon
of water on top of a seven gallon pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: just watch it saturate that whole top
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can just walk away and do the
next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fill it up too far, you've got to
just stand there and pour it slowly to
[SPEAKER_00]: where the water saturates into the medium
and drains down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can pour a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave yourself some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in the future, we may choose to top
dress these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may want to add some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to add some bat guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just add some fresh soil with some
charged up nutrients in it to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave yourself some room so that you've
got options and you've got watering space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you are filling your container,
pack your medium in there slightly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it packed real snug,
but you don't want it fluffy and loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make the roots work to dig down
into the dirt and have some more to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and do a little exercise to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also don't want to suffocate them and
make it so hard that the roots simply
[SPEAKER_00]: can't grow into the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pack it a little bit,
but don't crush it so tight to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots can't even grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you packed it too loosely,
you will notice on the first couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: waterings, you'll just get a giant hole in
the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the dirt will just cave in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll create a hole in the middle,
and then you'll have to repack it,
[SPEAKER_00]: put more dirt in there, then re-water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just should have gone a little harder
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go too hard, the roots just aren't
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go too soft, the water is just
going to fall right through, and you will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely get indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack it slightly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just use the palm of my hand,
and I give it just a few pats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw in just a few scoops of dirt just
to give myself a few inches of dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I just pat it in, and then I
throw in some more dirt, and then I just
[SPEAKER_00]: pat it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear me just tapping on the table
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just patting it down, just getting the
dirt nice and even in there, and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: just pour more dirt on top of it and just
pat it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather pour some in and then pack it
down, and then pour some in and pack it
[SPEAKER_00]: down, instead of fill it up and then try
to pack all that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's not really as
productive as packing each little layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pour some dirt in there, pack it down,
pour some dirt, pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself up to about an inch and a
half, or two inches to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got our three, our five,
or seven gallon pot filled with our
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate mix, and it is leveled off,
and we've got about an inch and a half or
[SPEAKER_00]: two inches of space so that we can add
water or top dress later in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the very center of that pot,
we need to create a space for our
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to create a little hole in which
to place our small root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to do it is find the middle
of that topsoil and just dig out about a
[SPEAKER_00]: fist size worth of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take out about just a fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pretty big fist, so just take
out about a fist size worth of dirt right
[SPEAKER_00]: in the center of that topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then whatever size pot my plant is already
in, say I'm in a beer cup or maybe I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: a six inch net pot, I will take a beer cup
or a six inch net pot and I will dig a
[SPEAKER_00]: hole in my new pot soil right at the top,
right in the center, and I will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: plant the cup in that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will dig a hole perfectly to where that
cup will fit, then I will backfill dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: around that cup, kind of snug,
then I will pull the cup or the six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: net pot out of that made hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have got a perfect template that is
the exact shape of the incoming root ball
[SPEAKER_00]: from my small veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically leveled off the dirt,
I dug out a hole, I put the previous pot
[SPEAKER_00]: in that hole, I backfilled it,
then I just pulled that pot right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made an impression, a template,
just a little gap for the next plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit perfectly into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a top layer of soil,
with this little round hole perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting, just chilling, waiting for a pot
to go in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next step is to pot our small veg
plant into that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do that, you know what I'm
going to recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sprinkle a little mycopowder right
into that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our fresh exposed roots are going to go
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just sprinkle some mycopowder right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just give it some love, give it a
boost, give it a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like laying out some cookies
for Santa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get it nice and ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some mycopowder right in the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next challenge will be to get the
small plant out of that small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it has grown really tight into
your beer cup, or really tight into your
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nicely root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of root mass in that
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a little effort to
get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I do it is I make a spock hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my first finger and my middle
finger together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my ring finger and my pinky
finger together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I place the stick of the plant between my
middle finger and my ring finger,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root ball, the soil is in my palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the plant is hanging upside down
and I'm holding onto the root ball with my
[SPEAKER_00]: spock hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that in my left hand because I don't
need as much coordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can just stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take my right hand and I kind of
just squeeze the cup or the beer cup or
[SPEAKER_00]: the six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just squeeze it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever rolled a joint too tight
and you're trying to loosen the joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to loosen the dirt out
of that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just squeeze all around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you really got to do and you'll
feel it loosening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe squeeze it and work it to the left
and right just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel how to loosen the dirt inside
of that pot once you start doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you're trying to do is loosen the dirt
so that it will fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little shake and it's going to
fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have an exposed root zone
in your hand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully when it came out, it all stayed
together in one big chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've taken good care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've properly watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've given it proper dry time and the
roots have developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and fat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all just one chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came out as a mess, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to pop that whole mess
into that hole that we already made and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the root ball out of the
container, you already know what I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle a little Mycos on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got exposed roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots love Mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Mycos are activated by touching
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle them on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it as much Myco powder as you can
afford to sprinkle on there at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a nice little coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just infect it with root inoculant powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came out in a mess, you need to
gently place it in that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get as much of that original dirt as you
can in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the root ball down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are dangling long roots,
set the dangly roots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little dirt on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower the plant in a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some dirt on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower it in a little bit more so that you
don't bind those roots up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to give those roots space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just drop them right in
there and smother them with fresh dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they came apart, keep them apart when
you're putting them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then backfill it with all the dirt from
that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have enough dirt there to level
everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lost some dirt during the movement,
just grab some more dirt out of your mix
[SPEAKER_00]: and just top it to where you have a nice
even layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack it in, not super tight, just tight
enough to keep that plant staying straight
[SPEAKER_00]: upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it came out nice and smooth,
we've got another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came out nice and smooth and you
feel like those roots are perfect and they
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't super bound but they're growing
well, you can just set, still,
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkle some Eicos on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can set that perfect root ball
right into that perfect hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sprinkle a little bit of dirt on top
of it and pat it in, and you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully transplanted plant that didn't
get any shock or any stress whatsoever
[SPEAKER_00]: during the transplanting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our other option, when you take it out of
the small container, if it is really bound
[SPEAKER_00]: up in there, if you see a lot of white
roots and it is growing in a circle and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting spiraled, you do have the
option to kind of break those roots up
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I do it is I hold it with my left
hand and I take my middle finger and my
[SPEAKER_00]: ring finger on my right hand and I come
straight up from the bottom of that root
[SPEAKER_00]: ball and I just plow my fingers through it
and just pull it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spread it right in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to tear some roots up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to mess some stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a nice, healthy root system,
that is only going to encourage growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spreading it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you set it in that template hole
that you've got, the roots will spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit, and instead of growing in a
perfect spiral, they're going to take off
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit for you and fill that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either way, sprinkle mycos on the roots
on that root ball that you pull out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle mycos on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always sprinkle some mycos into the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then gently place that small root ball
into that fresh hole and just cover it
[SPEAKER_00]: with dirt gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't pack it down too tightly,
but pack it down tight enough to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's not going to cave in when we
water it and that it's tight enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: give that plant enough support to stay
upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know on the first watering if you
did not do it tightly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't do it tight enough,
you're just going to need to add more
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that plant is basically transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you label that plant at this
time before you forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to move that plant under
the appropriate light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also mention you may need a
saucer or some sort of a catch tray
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we water these plants, we expect to
have some runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is a good time to consider placing
your plant on a saucer or some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: catch tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the trays down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the lighting and which
we're going to place these plants under.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use T5s for your fresh
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the T5s really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get those T5 lights three,
maybe four inches away from your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that you adjust them every
day because the plants are going to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly and they will grow into those
lights if you don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use ceramic metal halide for
your fresh transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 315s or the 630s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep those a little bit
further away than the T5s, probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: a foot, maybe 18 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are very brand and power specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would follow the recommendation from the
manufacturer on your LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough experience with your
LED to know what it's going to do to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many vendors, so many
different makes and models that it is hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to give advice for LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you certainly can use LEDs through the
entire cycle and you can add absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: use them right now for your fresh
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use metal halide or high
pressure sodium, also known as high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to use high intensity
discharge lighting, pay close attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: how the plants are reacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a 400, you can probably
get 12 to 18 inches away and not have any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using a 600, you could probably
get 18 inches away and not have any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a thousand watt light,
you may want to start off about two feet
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the canopy, maybe even more,
as you start introducing these plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: that larger light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time goes on, you can get closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will grow closer to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you are introducing young plants
to large lights, pay attention to how they
[SPEAKER_00]: react.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to burn these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stress them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to burn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stress the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to put them into any kind of
shock as we transplant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a critical time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to put them into turbo mode
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to punish them and put them
on timeout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give them encouragement to take
off right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our plants under the
appropriate light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our light the appropriate
distance away from our canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the amount of light hours
we are going to give these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked earlier about lighting
schedules and apparently in a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, I did make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point I said something about 18 on
and 16 off or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said your light cycle will always
add up to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my light cycle I said didn't add up to
24 hours, I was too high to be doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when you talk as much as I do,
I think you're going to make a few
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes and I encourage you guys to let
me know when I make a mistake so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said I did make a light cycle
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow me to correct myself in this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several cycles that work very
well for our veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One common cycle is 24 hours on and zero
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly recommend this if you have mother
plants that tend to auto flower on you or
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next option is 20 hours on and four
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give the plants a few hours to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also gives my equipment four hours to
rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running a veg room with 25
lights, that is a hundred hours of lights
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't have to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of electricity that you save.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also not paying for as much cooling
and humidity control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 20 on and four off is good for your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants get to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't want to take a nap?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the roots do a lot of activity
in the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the plants grow a lot in the
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugars are processed in the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 on, four off is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make any plants that may want to
auto flower in a lesser cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will prevent them from auto flowering
and it will also give you maximum growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will keep your mother plants really
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very common veg cycle is 18 on and
six off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very common because it very
closely mimics the outdoor cycle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to outdoors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason people will adjust between the
16 and eight and the 18 and six is because
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants will try to flower on their
own with the 16 hours of daylight once
[SPEAKER_00]: they get large enough and once they get
root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I feel like more light is more
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired source of
energy and nutrient for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not maximize the light input?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, some plants will only take so
much light per day and they'll just shut
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you're going to overload
them with light in a small grow room with
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, our options are 24 hours on and
zero hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't really recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these large veg plants, the next
option is 20 hours on and four hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, that is what
I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another environment, you can go 18 on
and six off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I found advantageous of the
20 on and four off is when I do induce
[SPEAKER_00]: that 12-12 flowering cycle, those plants
really notice a change in photo period and
[SPEAKER_00]: they really go into flower really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I found has
helped quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of those light cycles will work for
your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find pros and cons to each of
those options based on your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: your location, your setup, and your
overall grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to find things
through trial and error when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try some things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what works best for you and your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it's going to come down to
what works best for your plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, at this point, our small veg
plants have been up-potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now large veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them in their forever pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them underneath a good light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that light on a solid schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our pots sitting on a saucer or
some sort of a catch tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now time to water our new
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend feeding these transplants with
a strong vegetative nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bottle that says veg,
that's the one you need right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something with a good NPK ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more N than you do P and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a high N ratio for this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend a mycoproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't put plenty of powdered
mycos in there, I recommend a mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal product that is in liquid form that
you can feed right in your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a small dash of carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of carbohydrates will help
feed those mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it will give the plants a little bit
of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend a little bit of Kalmag at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are big enough to take Kalmag,
give them a little bit of a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend a little bit of
enzymes at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help keep the root zone nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mycoproducts and the enzymes will work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make a happy rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also want to add a little bit of
potassium silicates at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium silicates make for robust plants
and it will also help with any stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any environmental stressors,
that potassium silicate will make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants just a little more resilient and a
little tougher for the mistakes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I recommend you adjust the pH of your
feed solution to somewhere between 6.2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were in cocoa in a commercial
facility, I would tell the guys to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH to 6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were in a soilless mix in a
commercial facility, I would tell them to
[SPEAKER_00]: go 6.3 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your pH meter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the value is and adjust up or
down as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down, then water the plants
with that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about watering plants,
I highly recommend you go back and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to episode 337, which is titled One
Through Five Watering Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: One Through Five Watering Tech will help
all growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're an
experienced grower, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional grower, you will learn
something from the One Through Five Water
[SPEAKER_00]: Tech episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an experienced grower and
you're trying to teach a new grower how to
[SPEAKER_00]: water your garden, One Through Five Water
Tech is a great training exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend everybody listen to episode
337 and learn about One Through Five
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before you water your plants,
we talked about the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not talk about the temperature of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wintertime in Colorado and it is
really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pulling water right out of the
tap, it's coming out of the tap way too
[SPEAKER_00]: cold to apply to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the water that we feed our plants
to be right around 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 65 would be acceptable, but I
wouldn't go much lower than 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine sticking your feet in some 65
degree water first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's like when you water the
plants with 65 degree water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't go any lower than 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stay closer to 70, maybe up in the
75, not much warmer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around 70 degrees is just about
ideal for watering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, you can always just turn
the hot water on as you're filling up your
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some environments, we don't have the
option for hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your water is coming out too cold,
you can either get a bucket heater from
[SPEAKER_00]: your local tractor or farm supply store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just sell bucket heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sell them at the farm supply
store for troughs so that you can warm up
[SPEAKER_00]: the pig and horse water so they don't have
to drink ice water in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if a bucket heater is not an option for
you, you can always fill up containers of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take them into the flowering rooms
or the bedrooms the day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let that light and that grow room
environment warm up the water for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's only if you remember to
do that the day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is, don't feed the plants
water that is really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that water to be right around 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this first watering, make sure you
really saturate the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have plenty of water coming
out of those drainage holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure to soak every spot of
the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want a dry spot because roots
will not grow into dry areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients aren't getting into those dry
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you fully saturate the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to soak it every time I water,
but it's mostly important this very first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it till you get a lot of water
coming out of those holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't leave the plant ever standing
in stagnant water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that water in the bottom of your tray
there doesn't evaporate or get sucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: by that plant within a few hours,
get a shot vac and suck that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now our plants are all
successfully transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have now been fed their big kid
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
environment in which to keep these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where to keep the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what cycle to have the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the day, I try to keep the
temperature between 70 and 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I try to keep the night around 65 to
75.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to have no more than a 10
degree swing in my temperature between day
[SPEAKER_00]: and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if it's 70 during the day,
I want it no lower than 60 during the
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly try to keep about five to seven
degrees in that swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's difficult in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we don't have the appropriate
equipment to monitor and or adjust things
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do your best to keep it within a 10
degree differential between night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point in the large veg phase,
I try to keep the humidity between 40 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around 50 is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to understand more about why I
keep the humidity and the temperature the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I do, I recommend you check out
episode 314 and it's called Vapor Pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can learn about VPD and why it's
important to keep the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in the appropriate range for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like to add to our large
veg is a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have wall fans or those fans on
stands depending on your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to have a fan just oscillating
in the room, circulating the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to circulate the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move the stale air around and
move that fresh air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants have fresh air constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to beat the shit out of the
plants with the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in some grows and they're just
terrorizing plants with fans and just
[SPEAKER_00]: beating them to death and wondering why
the plants look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to rustle the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to put a fan about one fan every
one or two lights depending on the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure that every area is getting
fresh air in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I feel like we have
officially entered the large veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goals and focus now are to keep
the plants pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to avoid nutrient and pH mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure not to overfeed our plants at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, pay very close attention to the pH
of your feeding solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep these plants healthy and
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to work on the top part of the
plants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on the bottom for the first
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to focus more on the top
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in the upcoming episodes,
we're going to work on shaping and
[SPEAKER_00]: structuring these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to talk about popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about bottoming and
topping and lollipopping our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is all in upcoming episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two quick things to cover before
we start wrapping up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are out of here for this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, one thing I should talk about is
pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to apply pesticide
sprays, today is a good day to start that
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are moving into the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in their big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and hit them with a light
pesticide spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the lights, douse the plants,
give them a couple hours to dry off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the lights back on to the regularly
scheduled program and pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you wrote down exactly what you
sprayed on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wrote down the product and you wrote
how much per gallon you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wrote down what time you applied it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a good frame of reference
so you can go in and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how the plants reacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look angry, you need to reduce the
application next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look happy about it, you can do
the same thing or consider increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: application rate if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I generally start my heavy pest
management application right when I move
[SPEAKER_00]: them into the large pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that will be important to
think about is flip time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are these plants going to veg in
this environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much space do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your genetics, depending on
your lighting, depending on your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, these plants could double in
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working, within a rise cross,
there is a good likelihood that by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you finish that plant, it will be
twice the size it was when you started the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that plant is 24 inches tall,
when you induce flowering, there's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance that plant will end up 48 inches
tall before it is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, you need to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that plant does not
grow up into your lights and burn itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to save, depending on the type of
light you're using, you need to save some
[SPEAKER_00]: space between the bulb and your top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start thinking about
how long we're going to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you veg too long, the plants will get
too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to do things like topping
and bottoming and lollipopping and
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting and cracking and trellising and
manipulating these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to need to give them a
little bit of time to recover from some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these techniques before we initiate the
flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we plan ahead and know how long we
anticipate to veg, we can predict when to
[SPEAKER_00]: do these steps to increase production and
flower at the ideal time and fill our grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can end up with our canopy right about
eight inches below that light and it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and even and it'll look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have any wasted space in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're an experienced grower,
your goal will be to fill your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a five by five grow tent,
you want a five by five canopy or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: a four and a half by four and a half
canopy because when the air flows,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sucks in a little bit, but you want to
fill most of that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very experienced grower, an older guy,
he said one day, if you had a cooler and
[SPEAKER_00]: you could fill it with beer, would you
fill it most of the way to the top with
[SPEAKER_00]: beer or would you fill that cooler all the
way with beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even a beer drinker and that makes
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want as many beers fit in that cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want your grow room to be
halfway filled with buds or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill that fucker up with buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal will be to maximize that canopy
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in future episodes, we will talk about
trellising, lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about sticks and cages and
cracking stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will go in depth in a lot of techniques
like that on ways to fill up your cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: for maximum production.
