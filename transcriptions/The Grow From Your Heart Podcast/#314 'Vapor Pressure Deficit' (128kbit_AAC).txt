[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 314.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show off by letting
you know what I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before the show, I took a big fat
dab of Starchild OG Live Resin from a cut
[SPEAKER_00]: above in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor of this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me it was tangerine haze and
trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can certainly taste that trainwreck,
turpentine, that dryer sheet sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a very small hint of the
tangerine haze in there, maybe on the
[SPEAKER_00]: aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gets me nice and talkative, gets me nice
and creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good podcast dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starchild OG Live Resin from a cut above
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I did think of you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a plant called Cactus Cooler and
it's called Cactus Cooler because it
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes just like the Cactus Cooler soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like oranges and pineapples and
it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not create it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clone of Cactus Cooler was gifted to
me by a friend, but I did breed it to my
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been given out as the freebie or as
a bonus pack on the dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it has an official name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is officially called Pineapple Wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got a freebie five pack of the
Cactus Cooler to Arise, you can change the
[SPEAKER_00]: label to Pineapple Wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the new official name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I went with the Pineapple
Wine, not only is it a great regular song
[SPEAKER_00]: name and it represents that island flavor
that it's got and the vibe of the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that I felt, but it carried that pineapple
and fruity flavor over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also the there's a chem dog and
an OG Kush and a funky flavor that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: came along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was added to the pineapple flavor and
it kind of gives it sort of a fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: wine funky sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pineapple Wine was a perfect name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make giant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get big old buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates that are going to come
off of these buds are going to taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: pineapple candy and pineapple wine and
fruity delicious turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be plenty of concentrates
coming off of these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pineapple wine at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I've got a couple of questions
that came from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with I think this one was kind
of fun, kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a real answer, but I wanted
to share this with my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a really good question about
the bug poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought about the other bug poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, those bugs that go in there and
eat the spider mites, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to poo somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably pooing right on your
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be pooping in the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs don't really live in the buds as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the spider mites don't
really go into the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to suck the chlorophyll out of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prefer the weaker leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to go sucking on the buds
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do find them making their little
teepees up on top of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because they want to get up
high so the fan can grab them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind can blow them to the next plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can start taking over the next plant
and build their colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll notice that they don't eat the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully the predator bugs are going
to get in there and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that all those trichomes and all
that resin is not a fun place to be and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just going to hang out on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go and eat all the shitty
bugs and then they're just going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty bugs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're just going to shit right
there on the leaves and then hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to trim that off and you're
not going to get too much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insect poop into your buds,
your concentrates, and eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, into your edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much poop do you think a little
tiny spider mite eater is going to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because spider mites are microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is their poop going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would rather have that little
bit of spider mite poop in my garden than
[SPEAKER_00]: more spider mites producing more spider
mite eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully by the time you harvest it,
it's been blown off by a fan or knocked
[SPEAKER_00]: off by a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that little tiny bit of poop is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it gets knocked off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last part of your message,
you say, should we dunk it like we've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes do for powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys aren't familiar with that,
there's a video of Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts, he fills it most of the way with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts the 30% hydrogen peroxide in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stirs it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he takes long colas that he's
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're freshly harvested, mostly trimmed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trims them most of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he dunks these buds straight into the
hydrogen peroxide and gives them a shake
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see the powdery mildew come
right off of the buds and it floats to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface right at the top of the water and
then he pulls them out and then he just
[SPEAKER_00]: hangs them up to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That method does work if you've got
powdery mildew or if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean something off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a shitty method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather you figure out what your
problem is and correct that and get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mildewy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand that in a commercial
growth, sometimes shit has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best way to do things,
but I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're not the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're told what to do,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that method does work if you're in
dire straits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do it in fear of predatory mite
poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little, little over reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you could do toward the end of the
flowering cycle, you could spray the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants lightly with just clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't soak them to where they're
dripping, to where the buds are gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated like sponges, you could just
dust them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just go in there and hit them
lightly with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the paint sprayer or if you
pump up the sprayer real hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just spray them like a little bit of
wind and a little bit of water and just
[SPEAKER_00]: clean them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, hopefully that's knocking off
any predatory insect poop that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: may have gathered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not gonna be much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a large grow and you've
released thousands of predators in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna find a half a gram of bug
shit in the whole thing, I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little tiny bit of predatory mite
poop that does happen is way better than
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mite eggs and spider mites and
spider mite webbing and a diminished crop
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and a lessened harvest weight
because you let the spider mites take
[SPEAKER_00]: hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's way better think about it this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even get to this part of my head
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way better than smoking some
questionable pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you smoked a couple of pieces of bug
poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even established how much bug
poop we may have smoked, but maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a minuscule amount of little bug
turds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that bug turds are less harmful
than a little bit of fluoromite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that some bug turds are a little
bit less harmful for you than pyrethrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that I would rather smoke a little
bit of bug turd than consume something
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in funky pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fair trade off for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the predatory mites that
I'm releasing in my garden are taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: shit in my buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they're taking a shit on the
leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they obviously poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All creatures that are eating something,
they're gonna poop something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that poop going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ending up in the cannabis that we're
smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's shaking off during
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang the plants upside down for like 14
days, not 14 days, like seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hang upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think all the bug poop is coming
off then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the white spray that we apply
toward the end of harvest, do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets rid of the bug poop?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want your opinion, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grillfromyourheartathotmail.com or
tweet me at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about bug poop in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, however much bug poop we're
smoking, I think it's probably safer and
[SPEAKER_00]: better than smoking a bunch of crazy
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you want your name said on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also said it was a stoned idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for getting stoned and having a
great idea that started a conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: created some podcast content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another question that came from
Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is about lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: An Instagram Live watcher asked,
when we send a sample to a lab for potency
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, do we send just the top or do we
send certain parts of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very good question because
the procedure was recently changed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division,
by the Colorado Department of Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Health and Environment, and also the
Colorado Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got together and they made a new
testing guideline or a new sample
[SPEAKER_00]: collection standard operating procedure is
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new sample collection,
the potency and contaminant sample
[SPEAKER_00]: collection standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sent out to all of the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody with a metric ID number got the
email recently and we all had to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: change the way that we collect samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are not allowed to just send in
the best looking buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything happens on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every inch of a grow facility is on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at a Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational or medical grow, you are on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all happens on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens in a very specific room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very specific way that the
samples are to be collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you the entire
procedure, but I'll tell you why we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: able to just take those prime choice tops
that look like they're the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we harvest, there are going to be
between 20 and 60 plants of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and they'll all be harvested as the
same batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just pick a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say Ghost Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say we just took down 40 Ghost Dog plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a batch and they've got a batch ID
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Ghost Dog plants aren't all going to
fit in one container when they go into our
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get into probably,
I don't even want to guess how many,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say eight to 10 different containers
and they're going to have different
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say Ghost Dog,
batch whatever, container number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost Dog, batch number whatever,
container number two, and they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled up to whatever number they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to get trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to get put into
containers after they're trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those containers will still be
labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost Dog, batch number, fucking container
number, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get instructions from
the lab testing place that's going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, Ghost Dog, batch number,
whatever you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Container number three, grab that
container, open it up, then go to the far
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom left corner we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are dried and cured and trimmed
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are buds that have been trimmed and
dried and cured and that are ready to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is to reach into there
and get one out of the bottom left like
[SPEAKER_00]: they requested and put that sample in the
sampling container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll request another bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may say Ghost Dog, batch number,
whatever, container number six,
[SPEAKER_00]: open the container and take the bud from
the very top right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We open it up, take a bud right out of the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that bud goes into our little
collection container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll give you different
various areas to take plants from or to
[SPEAKER_00]: take your samples from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to follow those
instructions and you've got to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sign for it and you've got to have a
witness and you've got to mark it down on
[SPEAKER_00]: a little paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite often it's say, hey Mike,
did Jeff do his job?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike's got to sign off for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Jeff actually took these samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, we're not allowed to just go and
get those prime looking buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this stuff is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing a face mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a mask on my face so I don't get
any beard hair into there so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got goggles on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got a lab coat or a Tyvek
suit that I've cut the leg end off of to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a little makeshift lab coat because
it's a little lighter and easier to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm all covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all lab-procedured.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I switch strains, I will switch gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I am using scissors to maybe cut
some stems out or something, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: actually switch scissors or clean the
scissors to make sure that if one sample
[SPEAKER_00]: has a microbial contaminant that I don't
move that to different samples and mess
[SPEAKER_00]: things up for our sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to keep things sterilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep things separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pretty tedious task of taking
samples to pass the Colorado standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these samples that we're taking for
potency, these are also our microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we send in the same sample to the same
lab to check the level of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and a few other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a terpene test, but it costs
more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they will run a microbial test on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will look for yeast and mold,
and I'm not sure everything that they look
[SPEAKER_00]: for because we've never had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing has come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing things correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also at the same time, they run a
random pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure who decides to run the
pesticide test, but randomly it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they run that pesticide test,
they can tell you if pesticides were
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell you which pesticides were
applied to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can tell you if they were illegal
pesticides that are allowed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Department of Agriculture and the
Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what was applied to your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no fooling these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting your microbe test,
your potency test and your pesticide test
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually required to send in four
grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're able to do up to four tests if
they require a gram per test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they should be able to test it
with just a half a gram so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably do somewhere between four and
eight, hopefully six solid tests so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can test us for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we come up real high, they can retest
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can test it for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes up with something,
hopefully they've got enough for another
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they're going to test us for
all that and they see something weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would just say run that pesticide
test just to see if they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something fishy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to need that fifth
and sixth sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it all comes back legit,
they're going to say, well, fucking test
[SPEAKER_00]: it again for potency because that rasta
Jeff killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to need sample number
seven at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, no, the question was, do you guys
just send in the main top for lab testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are specifically instructed by the
laboratory through an email of which parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant to send in for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before those regulations were like
that, we were still not allowed to just
[SPEAKER_00]: send in the main top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were supposed to pull parts from
different parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually be dried, trimmed,
cured buds that are ready for the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like buds that are, you're almost ready to
drive them to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just waiting for the lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gets tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get it tested and then it's got to
sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not even allowed to sell it until
that lab test comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not allowed to leave the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't go to the store until it's lab
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys know it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also not allowed to go to a
concentrate or edible maker if it hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been tested yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've got trim or buds set aside
that we want to make concentrate out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not allowed to send that until the
buds have been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that everything is clean and
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, basically we're not allowed to send
just the tops was what your question was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes you may find that the tops
don't hold the most THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the light was too close and it
cooked the THC right out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those bottom buds get a little
frostier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the tops got touched too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those big old tops were just
handled and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll find those middle buds
have the better potency, but that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for another great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that that person wants their
name revealed on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep that private.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you guys have a question,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of requests to talk
about vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote a few notes and I would like to
teach you guys about vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vapor pressure deficit has been the hot
new buzzword.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis community, it's been in
the magazines, it's been in the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are trying to sell you new
equipment so that you can monitor your
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep seeing the letters VPD in
magazines, when people are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions in the grow room, they are
talking about the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a couple of things
before we work up to explaining the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before we can understand vapor
pressure deficit, we need to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you already know what
transpiration is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to get everybody up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when water evaporates from the
plants, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants absorb the water through the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use what they need and then they
release the excess nutrients through
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration, through the underside of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically the plants version of
sweating or maybe the plant going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the main factors that contribute to
transpiration are temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the grow room gets hot, the plants
will sweat and transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vapor pressure deficit is what decides
how much those plants are allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is smart and it tries to prevent
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's too dry and the plant can feel
that it's too dry and it's releasing too
[SPEAKER_00]: much vapor, it will actually close the
stomata and stop itself from dehydrating
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So too high of a vapor pressure deficit,
the stomata will close and the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: basically stop functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too high of a vapor pressure deficit,
and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That stomata will close and again stop
functioning, which will cause your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen the plants just look
like shit and you can't figure out why?
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are a little leathery,
they're a little bit funky, or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a little bit crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes that's from a vapor pressure
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes that's caused by a fan beating
the shit out of that area of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just moving all the vapor away and
you've got nothing but dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a plant with no moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got these closed stomata because it's
just dry all the time around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant is actually struggling to
keep that section happy and healthy and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the nutrients moving the way that it
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vapor pressure deficit is basically
what the plants are feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about yourself trying to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you go to the desert where it's
super dry and then maybe another day you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the zoo and you go to the rainforest
area where it's super moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or shit, maybe you lived in Las Vegas
where it's super dry and then maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a summer in Lawrence, Kansas where
it's super moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about how your skin and your
lungs reacted to those different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to Las Vegas and it's super
hot, it's 120 degrees and it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get out of the car, your skin starts
to feel tight and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to breathe, your lungs are
like, dude, that air is hot and dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lungs get all dried out and you need
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go get a drink because you're
just drying yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine when you go to Kansas and you
get out of the car and your skin feels all
[SPEAKER_00]: moist and supple and your hair gets all
funky and curly because all the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: in the air, but you can breathe because
all that moisture, you just suck in big
[SPEAKER_00]: old clouds because it's not dry and stale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the vapor pressure deficit having
an effect on humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice when it's a little cooler,
you can breathe a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice if you ever have been in a walk-in
cooler, you can breathe super well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: walk-in cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you ever been standing by the
oven and tried to take a big deep breath?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really unpleasant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of temperature there,
but there's also moisture being involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier that vapor pressure deficit
is actually a math equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try to explain this equation for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vapor pressure deficit equals liquid
saturation vapor pressure minus the air
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated vapor pressure times the air
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to say it again,
so if you want to write it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can write this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD equals LSVP, which is liquid
saturation vapor, minus, and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: parentheses, we've got the air saturation
vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times the air percent of relative
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're multiplying air saturated vapor
pressure times air relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are subtracting that from the
liquid saturation vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that makes any sense to you,
you'll understand how to do that equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not need to do that equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are charts available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are monitors available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several companies that make
light temperature, humidity, CO2 monitors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of them already include the
vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see that VPD and you never knew
what that was, that is vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'll find a lot of great charts
online that will show you your ideal vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look online for a chart,
keep in mind that a lot of those charts
[SPEAKER_00]: are designed for non-cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be very plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running a couple of different
devices that show me my vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got multiple grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also visit other grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been paying attention to a SmartB
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been paying attention to the PL
grow systems unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I've learned, where I see the
plants happiest in weeks one through two
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower, I like to have a vapor pressure
deficit somewhere between eight and 11,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to put you at about 77 to
79 degrees with 65 to 75 percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do the equation we talked
about earlier, the liquid saturation vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure minus the air saturation vapor
pressure times air percent relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, that equation is going to come
out to between eight and 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for weeks one through two, you're
looking at a vapor pressure deficit of
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: For weeks three through four, you're going
to want to start lowering your humidity a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to get a little bit
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for a vapor pressure
deficit somewhere between 10 and 13.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be at 75 to 77 degrees,
and you're looking for 55 to 65 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, weeks five through nine, we're going
to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go down to about 42 to 50
percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want 74 to 76 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do the math equation in those
ranges, that is going to bring our vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit to 13 to 15.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want it a little cooler and a
little drier at the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to give it too much moisture
because we want to avoid bud rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we want to get it a little cooler
because that nice cool ending temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to give us some nice sexy colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the ideal vapor pressure
deficit ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to be between 11 and
15.5 seems to be our ideal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have anything to measure your
vapor pressure deficit, you can measure
[SPEAKER_00]: your relative humidity, and you can
measure your temperature, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do the math equation, and you can figure
out your vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get it dialed in, you may notice
that you can increase the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients you're giving your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may actually have to water the plants
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get your vapor pressure deficit
dialed in, your soil may dry more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a better wet-dry cycle from
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to pay attention
to all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change your grow,
but it will be for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one more thing that we can tweak and
dial in and make our plants reach their
[SPEAKER_00]: full potential.
