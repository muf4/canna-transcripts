going to get into the episode about how to
[SPEAKER_04]: interact with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I think we have learned today is
that we need to sign like an emergency
[SPEAKER_04]: contact form for people when they come
over and take dabs because I try to fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: people up over here, apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting to my left is our good friend,
Buzzy.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing today, my friend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, y'all as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here, kind of in front of me a little
bit off to an angle is our good buddy,
[SPEAKER_04]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here, even more in front of me is our
buddy, Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, yo, doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get to see you often enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I sat over here like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, Sloppy was on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not early, I was fucking impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a topic that we're going to talk
about tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell a little quick story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday, I was at work and one of my
tremors, I will not say his name just
[SPEAKER_04]: because I got respect for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my tremors called me and he's like,
hey, bro, can you do me a favor?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, anything for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, can you come pick me up at
the fire station?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, I got pulled over and they
gave me a DUI for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they pulled him over.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had probable cause to pull him over.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they pulled him, walked up to the
car, the car reeked of cannabis because
[SPEAKER_04]: he's a tremor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Occupational hazard, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the cop was like, holy shit,
you smell like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my buddy was like, well, I'm a tremor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, all right, well,
get out of the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give you a sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my buddy failed the test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They then put him in the cop car and took
him to the fire station and drew blood.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, they called me.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy called me and said that I can
come pick him up.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of minutes later, my phone rang.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my buddy saying, hey, the state
trooper just said that if you look,
[SPEAKER_04]: smell, or act high at all, he's going to
arrest you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be cool if you're coming or I'll call
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't smoked since.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was early.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like two in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even think I smoked before I
went to work that day because I go to it
[SPEAKER_04]: too fucking early to smoke sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hadn't smoked all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was crispy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason my eyes would be crispy is
because I'd been up for too long working
[SPEAKER_04]: in the fucking grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I drive over there and I call my buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, can you come out?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, hold on, the cop's going to
come talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh fuck, he's going to
come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got my couple of friends in the car
from work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just brought everybody with me because I
didn't want to leave them there without
[SPEAKER_04]: the boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put them in the car like a field trip
for the boys and took them to the fire
[SPEAKER_04]: station.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get out of the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you guys stay here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody record this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple of the people recorded the
interaction on their cell phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in case shit went sloppy,
nothing went wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I walk up to the cop and he's like,
so your buddy was pulled over for DUI.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's too intoxicated to drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the opportunity to either take
him to jail and keep him, or I can release
[SPEAKER_04]: him to a responsible adult who will
declare responsibility for him for the
[SPEAKER_04]: next eight hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know the guy, he's a good dude and
he's going to come work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need him to fucking come work with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was on his way to work when he got
pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, yeah, man, I'll sign the
paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cop's like, I need your ID.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he took my ID and watched me write
down my information as I was doing it and
[SPEAKER_04]: ran my license and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, you're not wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never felt more unwanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, that was sober.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was kind of, the cop, I want to
give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was really fucking cool for being a
state trooper that had to give my friend a
[SPEAKER_04]: DUI.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave us information on how to avoid
getting ourselves in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said stuff like, don't smell like
cannabis so strongly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't smell like cannabis, have expired
plates and do these certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said there are 15, he didn't tell us
what they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said there are 15 things that they look
for as main keys and my buddy hit nine of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he definitely got arrested,
but they let him go to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cop was really cool, but I've been
talking about doing this episode about
[SPEAKER_04]: what to do if you're involved with law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like my buddy handled himself well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told them he worked in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They asked us a lot of questions and I'd
quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was picking him up, the cop asked
basic questions and then he got friendly
[SPEAKER_04]: with us and started asking questions about
the industry and work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at one point I just shut up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, I don't want to answer any
more questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: He tricked me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's my friend now and I'm telling him
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to pull myself out of that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it brings us to this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really good way to segue into this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't drive high because they're out
looking for people in Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the start.
[SPEAKER_04]: This officer told us it's the start of
their searching for DUI season.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the state troopers have recently taken
a drug expert class.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the state troopers are now
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis intoxication or impairment
experts or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where they could tell how high you
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this cop said things that made me
think he was serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew stuff about my buddy being
intoxicated that I know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, your buddy doesn't look high or
act high, but when I interviewed him,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell there are things inside of him
that are going on that indicate that he's
[SPEAKER_04]: high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was impressed by the way that he put it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some things that we could
do to maybe help ourselves out and not get
[SPEAKER_04]: in as much trouble and maybe prevent
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe hopefully walk away without any
fucking handcuffs or maybe instead of
[SPEAKER_04]: getting all the way taken to the jail,
keep yourself in a situation where they
[SPEAKER_04]: call Rasta Jeff and he gets to come pick
you up and sign for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about if you get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your method, our friend Buzzy over here,
he's told me his method of how to handle
[SPEAKER_04]: himself when he gets pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go around the table and I'll
start with Buzzy because he's to the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're driving down the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you got a little weed in the car,
but it's hidden.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of our listeners are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these people are going to be
however many percent of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you are is really going to depend on
what you should do before you get in the
[SPEAKER_07]: car.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, if you are driving with weed,
regardless of where you are, you should
[SPEAKER_13]: pretty much put it in the trunk always.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in no way endorsing breaking the
law.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to teach you how to be a
little smarter about getting to a problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is in Colorado where it's all gravy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll stick with Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Colorado out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you light up a big blunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me find you an ashtray, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, just do it right here onto this
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ass into this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a MacGyver, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: MacGyver, MacDaver, MacBluntGyver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you invented ashing into the
Swisher package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to just ass into stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's order in the court.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tapping the gavel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy Buzzy over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got those red and blues behind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're flakey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blink, blink, blink.
[SPEAKER_13]: What am I getting pulled over for?
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the fuck knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the cops, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not using your blinker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being in a car and driving and just being
a person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Windows are tinted.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know what color you are in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have no idea what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even know yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop walks up to the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shines his light right in your goddamn
face.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually he'll say something like...
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have the window rolled down before
he gets there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your hands should be on the steering
wheel.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Both hands on the steering wheel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to be able... The cops should be
able to see both your hands.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is to... My method is avoid anything
possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Be extremely what the cop wants to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give him the most desirable situation
possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Be submissive to him almost.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm just trying to avoid paying
money to the state.
[SPEAKER_13]: Before getting shot.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is my goal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So far his method and my method are very,
very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
So just keep your hands on the wheel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go driving a little too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go driving like an asshole in these
parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to give you a warning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it goes well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the key to it, I think we're all going
to have the same story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be polite to the cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to be... Know your rights,
but don't try to invoke them immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the cop comes up, give him what he
wants until they start fucking with you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The important thing to keep in mind here
is that they have all the power and can
[SPEAKER_07]: execute you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not to fucking flaunt it at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: 99 times out of 100, or probably even more
than that, you're going to get annoyed,
[SPEAKER_07]: ticketed, and sent on your way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that one time out of however many,
they're going to freak out and shoot you
[SPEAKER_07]: in the face, or get pissed and drag you to
jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in some towns the cops will just
straight rob you and take your shit and
[SPEAKER_04]: leave you there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take your shit and leave you on the side
of the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to continue.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the same pool over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you got to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exercise your rights.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you follow the little script
they're expecting, nine times out of 10,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're on your way in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10, 15 minutes, as long as it takes them
to run your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the same pool over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've gotten pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've gone through all the shit our buddy
Buzzy over here has handled.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now when the cop comes back with your
license, registration, proof of insurance,
[SPEAKER_04]: he goes, Hey Mike, kind of smells like you
got weed in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what's the proper response at this
point?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't consent to any searches,
sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slappy, do not endorse that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not ever endorse running from the
law enforcement unless it's in a video
[SPEAKER_04]: game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep repeating that when they ask you
to search your stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need major probable cause and they'll
make shit up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Altoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probable cause because drunks use
that to cover their breath.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not probable cause.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about myself?
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in a giant grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trimming plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were six feet tall today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to chop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to lean in between two plants and
chop plants down and carry six foot tall
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So am I sure?
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably reek.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got trim on me right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I was coming from work and they said,
you smell like marijuana, I work in the
[SPEAKER_07]: legal marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a side effect of my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably probable cause to search
my vehicle though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say be strong on distinguishing
the different smells between smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and fresh marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This smell that you're smelling is work
related.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the smell of a plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, they're arguing about
smells because you're not slurring your
[SPEAKER_07]: speech, because your eyes aren't red,
because they didn't catch you weaving.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't do that shit is probably one of
the things we should put on the list to
[SPEAKER_04]: avoid getting your ass in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're sober right now, you can argue
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a smell that I picked up at work,
working while sober.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on my way home sober.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's what you're smelling.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you insist on searching the car,
like unless they're finding roaches in the
[SPEAKER_07]: ashtray or a dab rig in a cup holder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And put your shit away you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're headed on the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have it out of reach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have your stuff in a, if you've got a
locked container, that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they'd prefer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we were talking about that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It works just like booze.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a 12 pack in the back seat
of the trunk, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that 12 pack is open and the 12th one
is in your cup holder, half trunk,
[SPEAKER_07]: you ain't fine no more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sloppy, you lit a blunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never passed it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on with you, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit it four times, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured there's only two of us smoking
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a puff on that blunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn up, turn down for what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to turn down your blunt at
the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I respect the blunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, and I grew this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of why I want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm so used to some of my friends
just not wanting to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sit here and face sales all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made me this stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did this to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the red and blue lights behind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just cruising in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You done nothing wrong that you know of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pull over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come up behind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you handle yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two different answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was younger, because I have two
totally different perspectives on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: From being an adolescent to being an
adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I remember why I don't smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it was out of respect for the blunt
in my homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could die happy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was younger, I was one of those
old, oh, fuck the police, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't do shit to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would approach the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pull me over and I'd be like,
why'd you pull me over this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd be really confrontational
towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what would happen because I was
being confrontational in a scenario where
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't need to nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You comply.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking comply to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are asking you within reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, why, why were you speeding this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep like what Buzzy said, keep your hands
where they can see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is to make the police officer feel
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as soon as they walk up to the
window, that should be your best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, those teeth are mighty white
today, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking real sharp in that clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and sunny out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say the phrase mighty white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start saying the phrase mighty white
to the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without putting myself out there too
much, I was driving, not high at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment, going 15 over and I had weed on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is back in North Carolina or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got pulled over and I had Colorado
plates because I had a rental car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going, I'm going 15 over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I was like, fuck, you know
what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like dude got out of the car with his
cowboy hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he had a cowboy hat and his badge was
on the hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was fucking serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so what happened was I drove back
to North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought a little bit of personal cause I
didn't want to deal with no like fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: ratchet shit to get weed back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got weed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got pulled over in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst place to get pulled over ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he got out with the badge on his hat
and I was like, oh, he's going to shoot me
[SPEAKER_01]: and my dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two little puppies, but so I'm
nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fuck, fuck, fuck Colorado
plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember right until he was in my
peripherals, I was nervous, like scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as he was at, I sung to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, I could have sung him a whole
disc.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so nice to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked me why I was speeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, officer, I've been driving for
like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that there's a rest area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was honestly just trying to make it
there so I can go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Runs my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't know how the police things
work, but I'm pretty sure that when they
[SPEAKER_01]: run my name in any state, they can see my
criminal background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it goes from state to
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he saw that I had it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not perfect, but the bigger stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he saw I had a record and he
treated me totally respectfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I pulled you over, accused you of
speeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to really come talk to you
because of your Colorado plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to see if you have anything to
hide from me, but obviously you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he left me, didn't even give me
the speeding ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all because I was, I made him
feel comfortable and I was polite because
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 over, they could take your license on
the spot if they really want to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were in Kansas and I had two pit
bulls in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after he left, I threw up because I
was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really thought I was going back to jail
and I was like, I hate life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take my dogs,
but I could have handled it like when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was younger and been an asshole and got my
dog shot and got fucking taser or killed
[SPEAKER_01]: myself or thrown back in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate seeing all these videos where
they're like, Oh, that's, that's police
[SPEAKER_01]: abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's police abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the dude isn't doing what the police
is asking him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like lay down on the ground, lay the fuck
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what, why do you want to get DDT?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just don't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point like they're pointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I saw a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: The police had a gun pointed at a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a knife and he lunged at them and
they shot him and people were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: unnecessary force.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a fucking hypocrite because if you
have a legal gun on you and I come and try
[SPEAKER_01]: to stab you right now, you're going to
shoot me you faggot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't fucking, don't be dating on the
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and when I say faggot,
I don't mean gay people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be all uptight about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a little fucking bitch about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a little faggot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, because if I try to stab you,
you're going to shoot me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I hate that because people are so
hypocritical because if they put
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves in the same position,
they would act totally different than what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate that because if you try to stab
me, I'm shooting you if I have a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: firearm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stand in front of that guy with the knife
and I'll give you half a second to decide,
[SPEAKER_04]: are you going to shoot him or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're shooting them every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six or eight times.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judges would be like, why didn't you
shoot them 17 times?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was only 16 bullets.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big Lebowski reference for all
the people that didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real trick here though, is to just be
calm and go through the script that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're expecting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not doing something you're not
supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people are doing something we
shouldn't be doing a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember how it used to be in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have to drive and go pick up
weed and drive it home all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the time that I was most at
risk, is when I just went and picked up a
[SPEAKER_07]: new quarter and had to drive it home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I made it real easy on myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I threw it in a backpack when I bought it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I threw that backpack in the trunk when I
got to the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I got pulled over on the way home,
it wasn't for speeding because I did my
[SPEAKER_07]: damnedest not to break a single traffic
law with weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got pulled over plenty of times with
weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they walk up to your car and you
go, good evening officer, and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: stink like weed in the car, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: They go, oh, I pulled you over for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me run your shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here's your ticket.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_07]: You show up to court, you pay that bitch,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit driving 105 on I-25, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's your ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cruise control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think looking them in the eyes is
key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're hiding something,
you're like- Take off your shades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, be respectful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you can be calm and confident,
they don't wonder why you're nervous and
[SPEAKER_07]: try to figure out why you're freaking out
and want to dig through your car.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hardest part for me is when they make
you sign the ticket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like normally I sign my name, like I get a
little motion, but then you get all
[SPEAKER_04]: nervous and your shit looks like fucking
polygraph or some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you look like you've got a major
neurological disorder when you sign your
[SPEAKER_07]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always sign sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if that happens, I guess I don't
know what I'm going to try to sign my real
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you end up going to jail and they're
going to, oh, our buddy's headphones here
[SPEAKER_04]: have taken a poo on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they back now?
[SPEAKER_04]: You in business?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's this connection here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to sign sloppy one time and
they're going to make that your real name.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to sign everything as
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my alias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the NC inmate, whatever it says
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I- Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got arrested once and my hat said sloppy
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take it down because you're your
gang name now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he brought it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, I can only assume that you're
sloppy, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had it tatted on my arm for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no- Wait, you had it on your
arm for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's covered up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, how did this dude have a
tattoo for a while?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have covered all of my gang affiliation
tattoos because- Nice work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to be a good person now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to be a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the old heads one day looked at me
and said, all that is is a bullseye for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody that doesn't like you and the
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh my God, that is genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, you walked down the
street, you're just telling everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup, yup, yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so now let's move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know what to do if you get pulled
over now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull the fuck over as quickly as you can,
safely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly and safely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull the fuck over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your hands where they can see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the cop come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be like, I want your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't flirt with a female cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: That pisses her off so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't call her Ms. Carter.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cop will come up, he'll be like,
hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he'll be like, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let that interaction go smoothly.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they ask for your stuff, tell them
you're going to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to reach into the glove box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask them to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask them if you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can I reach in my glove box and grab
my license, registration, proof of
[SPEAKER_04]: insurance?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to reach in my pocket,
get my wallet out now, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, don't shoot me, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then hand him your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend everybody records interactions
with the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you're pulled over,
turn your camera phone on, place it
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_13]: You can just stream it live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stream it periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope that shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Periscope it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then like, yo, I mean,
why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want everyone seeing me cry on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can, record it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call my mama, someone call my mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an extra layer of protection for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're lucky, you live in a place
where the cops have cameras stuck to their
[SPEAKER_07]: chest that they can't turn off,
but you're not lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you drive away, don't get
all nervous and do something stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Try not to peel out as you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't celebrate too hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was nervous as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else I was thinking about
earlier today that I had to realize as an
[SPEAKER_01]: adult is not every officer is a fucking
scumbag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: By saying that every officer is just
trying to make your day worse is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: being racist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the same as labeling a race as
doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being cop-ist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, God, it's just job-ist or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every fast food person is going to be an
asshole and every cop is trying to fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: you over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen cool cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've interacted with cops who are
literally just trying to do their jobs.
I know cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know cops that have given me... So when
I was younger, like 24, 25-ish,
[SPEAKER_04]: my girlfriend at the time worked,
managed a bar, and we would go smoke in
[SPEAKER_04]: the alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an alleyway that went one way
and you could turn left or right to come
[SPEAKER_04]: into the parking lot of the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to the other way, you'll go
through another area.
[SPEAKER_04]: This cop would roll through and he knew we
were out there just puffing all the time
[SPEAKER_04]: in that alley because you could just walk
right out of the side door of the bar and
[SPEAKER_04]: go sit in this little area between cars
and smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he would come through,
he'd flash his brights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd put our shit away and be prepared
to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wouldn't have to fuck with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would just rather not see us smoking or
maybe he's got somebody else in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not all cops are assholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy was trying to help us out,
like not have to do paperwork and fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: with us just because we want to smoke some
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I've just had dozens of
interactions with... When I was a
[SPEAKER_07]: teenager, I used to get pulled over like
twice a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a car that had really loud
subwoofers in the area I grew up in.
[SPEAKER_07]: That made me the biggest target on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you follow the script nine times
out of 10, you're out of there in 15
[SPEAKER_07]: minute stops.
[SPEAKER_04]: We rarely see any good shit about the cops
on the news, on the internet, on TV,
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere like that because you rarely hear
anything about the good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people do good shit, it's like,
oh yeah, that cop helped that old lady up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's his fucking job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You only see cop kick the guy in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: In psychology class, I learned about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually life period.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you notice people talking about stuff a
lot or even the news, it's never good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because even though it's unknown,
you don't realize that good stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that bad stuff is a blip on the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you remember in reference
to because it's usually things are
[SPEAKER_01]: copestetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when something bad happens,
it really sticks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what people want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to hear like, a hundred
kids were saved today.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to hear, you know, puppies
getting kicked off of a cliff.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are fucked up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they see bad stuff and it gives
them... Puppies getting kicked off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cliff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see like a fucking vine of six seconds
of just somebody punting puppies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just replays over and over in my
fucking head right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally feel like people want to see
bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a reason to fuel unnecessary
fire, to complain about why they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: doing well, or to use it to, to why things
are so fucked up, this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, especially like, oh man,
here in America, like we are so privileged
[SPEAKER_01]: as Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate this whole anti-American thing
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people standing on flags.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I see you stand on a flag, I'm running
you over at my Prius.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's so, that's so ignorant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know why this, yo,
this is why, this is why, because no one
[SPEAKER_01]: is fleeing from America.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not putting your family on a door
and pushing it into the ocean to get
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like America is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, there's no death raids
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's nighttime, we're in here making
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not having one of us make sure that
death troopers aren't coming and killing
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody in our fucking village.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate people that are like, oh,
America is horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're able to be the person that you
want to be because you're in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because being yourself in other countries
can get you fucking murdered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as shitty as that sounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This jar of weed, this is probably,
I think that's about a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That half ounce of weed right here in most
countries would probably get your head cut
[SPEAKER_04]: off, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: You never- Not most, but several.
[SPEAKER_13]: In a few, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of countries, this would be the-
Jail time in most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we are so like free to do,
even like- There are a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't downplay that there are
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but on the grand scheme of things,
he's completely right.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can drive down the street and get 75
different kinds of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can drive our own vehicles.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can, we're all- Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all, I bet everybody in this room has
varying religious beliefs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, I'm not going to ask, but we can
all- I have like every religious tattoo on
[SPEAKER_04]: my hand.
On one hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: On one damn hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we could all express them by having,
I've got a tattoo here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your symbols there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have a good idea what you
follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure you two kind of link up in
the same similar sort of way from
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations we've had, but in other
countries, one of us would be beheaded for
[SPEAKER_04]: what we all believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be fighting to the death right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very least like spend all day
pretending like that wasn't you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't have these dreadlocks in a lot
of places.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of states, not Colorado,
you'd get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked you this- Profiled.
[SPEAKER_07]: At one point, I literally asked you like,
how the fuck do you not get pulled over
[SPEAKER_07]: all the time?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's because you don't stand out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in Colorado anymore, especially not in
Buffalo.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the listeners don't realize,
I've been told so many times that my voice
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't match my appearance when people
meet me.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, especially when I'm at the store
at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go in, I buy a lot of product there
and I also deliver products sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know if I should have said
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might edit that shit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I buy a lot of product there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I do, sometimes I bump into
people that are shopping and they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognize that voice and they turn
around and they look at me and they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: sure if that dreadlock guy is the guy from
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the listeners that aren't privy,
I guess, I'm 6'5 and I've got dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_04]: seriously to past my ass, like mid-thigh
region, almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the really longer ones goes almost
to my kneecaps by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I feel pressure from the police
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cop yesterday asked me, he said,
how long did it take you to get those
[SPEAKER_04]: dreadlocks that long?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 11 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, wow, commitment buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That cop was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the courthouse getting
fingerprinted for, when I worked at a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary, everybody had to go get
fingerprinted and had to go take a day off
[SPEAKER_04]: because it took them all a fucking day to
fingerprint me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a cop in there walked by and he goes,
great dreadlocks, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, that was a cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that cop complimented my dreadlocks
just now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he meant it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wasn't even being sarcastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, had a smile on his face and
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not all cops are cocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some cops are cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, and I'm a freak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sometimes I do feel some pressure
from the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all that America stuff,
is it good with the police?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's just a big thing going on
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could really just go on about America,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, social media warriors and stuff,
people who are like just bitching about
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that what we were just talking
about earlier, like how public executions
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that for one hour out of the week,
we were talking about other countries
[SPEAKER_01]: being fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that everybody should be made to
watch one hour of what's really going on
[SPEAKER_01]: in other countries, like a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hour a week of show me what's up in
Mexico, show me what's up in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show you what's really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people really think we have it bad
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a great idea, but I think
it's all about the source.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you going to get that material?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking internet has all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has people being publicly executed by
the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But does it have the good also?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have the good as well as the bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is, I was just referencing
to the fact that people bitch about
[SPEAKER_01]: America so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are really okay here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went to Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time ever in Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think someone like Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into a debate with my friend there
because she's an active feminist and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, which I support.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she said that women don't have a lot
of rights here and they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: restrained and so on and so forth,
which in some ways I do see statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: they get paid less and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as freedoms of the world,
women are really free in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it, but in other countries,
women are still getting stoned to death
[SPEAKER_01]: for talking to males in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got women running for president.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, things are different, but we are
farly advanced in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that sounds weird to say,
but- How can people find you on Twitter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy919.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angry tweet me if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure all of the tweets about the
anti-feminism statements are headed
[SPEAKER_04]: towards Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say anything about anti-feminism.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I'm totally for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some microaggressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it was just a statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost swallowed your whole plot when
I said the word microaggression.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a new word for this generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stand up for whoever you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fucked up that it's fucked up
to be proud of your heritage nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's like, I'm Italian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's with their roots.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody wants to be guilty of cultural
appropriation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a step away from being racist.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost a foot into the racist
category, which it isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, racism, isn't it just
having pride in one's race?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't bigotry the real problem or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it shouldn't be a thin line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should be proud of who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're German, be proud you're German.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're black, be proud you're black.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're Asian, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's when you add hate to it,
like, oh, I don't like these other people
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not this, that because of
the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's misinterpreted a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just see what they want to see
straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take any story and make it good
or bad by changing minor details,
[SPEAKER_01]: altering shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two people can read the same book and get
totally different stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two people can watch the same car accident
and tell two totally different stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perspective is a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can watch the same fight and have two
totally different stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both people won.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike beat the shit out of Jeff and you'll
be like, Jeff beat the shit out of Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was stomping him.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Mike had him the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard stuff like that, like back in
school shit, like both people won.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, who won then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all just like, everybody is,
is, is Hulk and Superman here?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we got way off course
here, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun bringing up the America stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to squeeze it in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do hashtag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so talking about what to do if you get
pulled over by the police guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: behave yourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't reach too quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have the video of the guy that
reached into his car to get his ID and got
[SPEAKER_04]: blasted by the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't reach so quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just chill out, chill out, chill out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to read, try to get a good,
a recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever said that is a genius.
[SPEAKER_04]: High five since you got your hand up.
[SPEAKER_04]: High five you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: High five on record it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how about if we're sitting here,
um, Mike, I'm going to know what I'm going
[SPEAKER_04]: to ask you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want, let's go Mike first.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say I just gave you the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sitting here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doorbell rings and not even doorbell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking this sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all, everybody's heart sinks when you
hear that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're pizza boys, not even like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like don't tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy don't knock like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all know right away like,
oh shit, it's the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you handle that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, take a quick look around the room and
make sure there's nothing laying there
[SPEAKER_07]: that I wouldn't want laying out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just to have it from back when weed
was illegal here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a good tip for anybody that's not
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't have knocked so hard on the
fucking table.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I don't know how cops knock like
that repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is that why they're annoyed when I
open the doors?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they're fucking hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their jeans all like, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I broke my knuckle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so open the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, good, you know, good evening officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then see what they've got to say
at that point, like nine times out of 10,
[SPEAKER_07]: if they were there and you were in real
trouble, they would have knocked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like your door would have exploded.
[SPEAKER_07]: If flashbang would have gone off and you'd
have an M16 planted in your head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if they're knocking, they just want to
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you just, if you're not interested,
say you're not interested, come back with
[SPEAKER_07]: a warrant and politely have the
conversation and step back inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if they're like asking about something
that happened up the street or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you want to talk to them, step out
onto the porch and pull the door shut
[SPEAKER_07]: behind you, sit there and have the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should you almost lock yourself out?
[SPEAKER_07]: Unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't open the door and go in for any
reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, not legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like without probable cause that like
there's a crime being committed inside or
[SPEAKER_07]: that somebody's in distress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if the cop says, well,
Mike, I'd like to take a look inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we believe you did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did what?
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that we're here to accuse you
of.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to look inside, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to go inside and shut the door
and continue on my evening officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't have a warrant, please come
back later.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have anything to hide,
Mike, there shouldn't be a problem with us
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in and taking a look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: I got stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a nice night.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike, thanks for, thanks for
playing along.
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like a dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a lot scarier.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm serious now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like a dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: A really small one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you won.
[SPEAKER_04]: You played that perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the right answers over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, uh, you've got a lot of rights in
knowing how to exercise them is key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, grab a pen or type flex your rights
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just Google flex your rights.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a series of videos put on by defense
attorney out of Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, who's really fun to watch on video.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really nice to know exactly what
to do when you run into law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Google flex your rights, flex your rights,
flex your rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we should have gone there before we
did this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have read that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, uh, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I meant to review it before I came over,
but I got a kid now and I had to try not
[SPEAKER_07]: to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read something the other day that says
that, uh, undercover vehicles cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: operate normal traffic stops in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know if that's true or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a Chevy Tahoe ish looking vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be certain on the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like a Tahoe, uh, pull somebody
over on I-25 the other day while I was in
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I have so many works at the Honda
dealership that said that he got pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: over by undercover and they said,
uh, you don't have insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you're not supposed to be
pulling people over in this vehicle and
[SPEAKER_01]: they let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, you know, I know, I don't never
believe a hundred percent what people say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was trying to, and he was a car
dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he just, he's a mechanic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say if he's a car dealer,
he already loses a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: credibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to turn your mic up over
there, Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going to let him die right on my,
take your baby dad, baby lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are, you'll end up sounding like
that.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have an intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day we're going to tell them we're
having a podcast and this is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: an intervention.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the fuck we're just talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching trivia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to quiz sloppy, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You open the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing I do because I'm a pet owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting my dog somewhere where they
can't act aggressive towards the police
[SPEAKER_01]: because fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, like not trying to sound
like crazy or nothing, but if they shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: my dogs in front of me, I'm catching some
charges because I'm swinging.
[SPEAKER_01]: No regrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, I am beast-moding that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs look fucking scary as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're so lovable, but they're 90
pounds of pit bulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand like sometimes I forget
that they're like that because people are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like get in their face, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cuddle with those dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sleep in my bed every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yeah, no, I'm putting my dogs up
and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm going to answer the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I see that it's the
authorities, I am stepping out and closing
[SPEAKER_01]: the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, when you said that, that's
exactly, I, I don't want them looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want them to have reason like,
Oh, I saw this on the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that while one of them talks to the
other one searches as much of your house
[SPEAKER_01]: as he can be lurking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a grinder on the table or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want none of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out, shut the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Always be polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eye contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I guess yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hands out of your pockets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have your hands in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the ultimate question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Mr. Sloppy, I'd like to come inside
and take a look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I want to make sure you didn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I really don't know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did the crime that we're here to
invent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, you know, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't have a warrant, don't,
don't let them do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let them fucking in your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and honestly from, from past
experience, even if they have a warrant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to do whatever the fuck they
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the one time I was arrested was this
exact scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stepped out of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the gas station to get a Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with my friend, Julie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've told this shout out to
Julian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to killer jewels and see he
makes beats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but no, I think I've told this story
on the cast before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we, we pulled up to the gas station.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like half a mile from the house and
mad cops swarmed the car and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: get out and they're like full tactical
gear and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they're yelling at Julian and I
was like, Oh, mistaken identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally thought that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they looked at me and said my
government name and, uh, they had the
[SPEAKER_01]: warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed me the warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I lived in a third story apartment,
one way in, one way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Told them the door was unlocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said my girlfriend's in there with my dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you already have all the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went up there and still busted out
every window, flash banged my girlfriend,
[SPEAKER_01]: tasered the dog and knocked the door in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I told them where everything was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cut my cushions open,
broke my fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they found half a gram of marijuana,
a bong and an unregistered firearm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't 21 yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was three months away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told them the door was unlocked to
go inside and they still blew that shit
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, if they have the warrant,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't have the warrant,
get the fuck out of my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they've got the warrant, they're pretty
much doing what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't knock anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: They booted in that fucking door.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it was, was they planned on doing
that to me anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to the store and he was
like, Oh, he took all the fun out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all of our toys polished.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to come play with our toys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all know what to do now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the cops come to the door, step
outside, talk to them, be kind,
[SPEAKER_04]: keep your hands where they can see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if, if a cop asks for your ID,
you do not have to present ID,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it helps with the interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to keep on that, like polite,
like I don't want to go to jail side,
[SPEAKER_04]: just give me a fucking ID.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not hiding anything,
you can, you can flex your rights and be
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I don't have to give you my ID.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just kind of being a dick.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of YouTube videos where
you can really learn your rights.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people really enjoy pulling the,
am I detained?
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I free to go?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are YouTube channels that are solely
dedicated to people harassing police
[SPEAKER_04]: officers walking down the street with
assault rifles, just to get a rile out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the police.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, sir, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: I can be here because of HB 41 seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and my nunchucks and samurai sword and
butt ass naked are fairly legal right
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, depending on where you live in
the U S like along our Southern States,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, anything bordering Mexico,
they've got random highway checkpoints
[SPEAKER_07]: where they look for immigration documents
and all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of that's unconstitutional and
it really pisses people off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so people who know exactly how to flex
their rights in a very specific way,
[SPEAKER_07]: risk giving the living shit beaten out of
them and thrown in jail and go flex their
[SPEAKER_07]: rights at fucking massive checkpoints and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, exactly how to do that makes
getting pulled over really easy to handle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you stay calm and keep your hands in
plain sight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ask them what is your info out of the
globe?
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you're walking down the street?
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you're just down on fucking fourth
street, walking from one store to the
[SPEAKER_04]: other, and it's kind of fucking dark out
and the cop walks up to you and he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: A cop just walks out of nowhere or he
comes from somewhere specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: He there's a manhole.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a rapist.
[SPEAKER_04]: The manhole smoothly slid over and the cop
elevated slowly out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that man's the devil or a ninja
turtle.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just, uh, you don't know where he
came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You and I were talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cop pops up bumps into us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I help you officer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up, sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see your ID.
[SPEAKER_13]: You reaching your pocket, handing me your
ID?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm just standing there and it's not
harassing me or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: That question depends what other items are
on my person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just about to say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's where I'm headed next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it looks like you guys were,
uh, we saw you guys smoking some weed back
[SPEAKER_04]: there when you were walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I saw you and you fucking reek like
weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in opinion, not a fax there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way you're going with this,
but right now, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was gonna say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I'm going to mace you,
tase you and hit you with something and
[SPEAKER_04]: then put you in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my perfume.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one and only benefit ever to
smoking cigarettes is that's what I always
[SPEAKER_07]: smelled like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't like point to the cigarettes
in my pocket and be like, no, sir,
[SPEAKER_07]: Marlboro.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'd go, oh, and then the line of
questioning would change like instantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when does the, uh, I want to,
I want to search your pockets,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you were the guy smoking weed over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't consent to any search.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I need to search you,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I don't consent to any searches sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I being detained?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I don't have any grounds to detain
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have a good evening officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I run your name first?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I free to go?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to run your name and then I'll
let you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go cause you're an ass hole and
you know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to just stay really calm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, if you're screaming,
am I being detained?
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer is going to be yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get on the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but if you just calmly, I'm,
I'm sorry, sir, I have somewhere to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I being detained?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not being detained, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I free to go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, good luck investigating whatever
it is you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple of weeks ago, weekends ago,
two or three weekends ago, by the time
[SPEAKER_04]: this podcast comes out, it would be three
weekends.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an event called the frost bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: The frost bowl was a local cannabis
competition where people grew cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: entered their cannabis and people were
judging it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a party, uh, where people
were consuming cannabis and the police
[SPEAKER_04]: came and they rated that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they, they didn't rate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The word they use was rated, but they came
and shut it down, but there were like 35
[SPEAKER_04]: cops that surrounded the place and all
stormed in all at once and shut the place
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's say we're in an event,
uh, she will, I have to change my event
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was going to say the cannabis cup,
but as of the past couple of days,
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't not look like the Denver
cannabis cup is going to happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, it sounds like a lot of places are
not going to be able to give that permit.
[SPEAKER_04]: State fair is already, uh, so they don't
want anything to do with any cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody wants to come to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you know, if you build it,
they will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you're the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say you're walking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis cup happens at the state
fairgrounds in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could fucking take an Uber over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It cost me six bucks an Uber over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm walking around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got, I don't know, four grams of
shatter in my pocket and seven grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: good flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got an ounce of good flour and I got
like 10 grams of shatter in my possession.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm legal to carry that as an adult in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cop walks up to me and wants to give me
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I handle myself with this cop in
public?
[SPEAKER_04]: An event at a cannabis event where I'm
going to be fucked with.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said straight in public, but it's at an
event, uh, where we're all consuming.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'd immediately like stop moving my
feet and make sure my hands were in plain
[SPEAKER_07]: sight and just be like, what could I do
for you officer?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd offer to smoke with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just kind of resist their questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the, am I being detained to my free
to go circle?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, in an event like that, especially like
I'm not there to get messed with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard anyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not carrying a weapon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't steal anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm just not in the mood to be
harassed.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I play it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in the mood to be harassed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you say that to the cop?
[SPEAKER_07]: Occasionally.
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't really come up that I've had to
run it like that since I was a teenager,
[SPEAKER_07]: like the good evening officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it doesn't matter if it's,
oh, I was speeding or, oh, we got a noise
[SPEAKER_07]: complaint or, oh, it smells like weed out
front.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you started off that way,
nine times out of 10, just being polite
[SPEAKER_07]: and going like, no, I don't consent to any
searches.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've got stuff to do later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I do to help?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually that gets you through it in five
or 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Worst case scenario, they go get out of
the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: They search your car.
[SPEAKER_07]: They find the weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They write you a ticket for the weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You go home.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sloppy standing up, taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't bump the rig on the mics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't dab the microphone like you did
last time you were here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like even if you're about to get in a
bunch of trouble, playing it cool with the
[SPEAKER_07]: original interaction with the officer
assures you don't get really injured
[SPEAKER_07]: during that interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get injured.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I didn't mention earlier that I
should have totally mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cop that pulled my friend over and
gave him a DUI asked him how long it had
[SPEAKER_04]: been since he smoked last.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend tried to play Mr. Honesty and
told them a little too early.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think that played a part of
the, uh, the arrest, uh, say yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if that cops, like how long ago
you're, you're driving and you pulled over
[SPEAKER_04]: cops, like when is the last time you
smoked cannabis yesterday?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I went to bed, I only smoke
cannabis to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of those questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the cop goes, how long has it been
since you've consumed marijuana?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can say, I don't, or I'm not legally
obligated to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you're driving, you're required to
hand over like license registration,
[SPEAKER_07]: proof of insurance, but you're not legally
required to self-incriminate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not legally required to answer any
other questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry snitching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them the minimum amount of
information that you need to give them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go on with stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're legally obligated to comply.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get arrested for just resisting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if the cop walks up and you run away,
like the cop that didn't even say
[SPEAKER_07]: anything, you just saw him walk onto your
block or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It immediately turned and ran and he chose
to chase you and arrest you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get arrested for just resisting
arrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got arrested for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All charges got dropped immediately,
but a relation of mine got arrested just
[SPEAKER_07]: for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, he, uh, they were climbing through the
window of a party while he was in high
[SPEAKER_07]: school and he put his arms out just to the
sides and went, get out of my house piggy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he got tackled and handcuffed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he thought it was hilarious,
but he knew he'd survive it because,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, after he was tackled and handcuffed,
like he could do and say what he wanted
[SPEAKER_07]: and he was going to get bailed out in less
than 24 hours anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I, I was young on probation
walking with another friend that was on
[SPEAKER_01]: probation and we had heard that if you're
on probation, you're not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: with other people on probation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these cops came up on us and I darted
and then I had a little dub sack.
[SPEAKER_01]: On me, but I threw it and then I got
arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I, like, I went to jail,
got bailed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as I went to court,
he was like, where are the other charges?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, well, what else did you get
charged from us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just ran because I thought I wasn't
supposed to be hanging out with this
[SPEAKER_01]: person automatically drops, let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on my right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I mean, that's a, that's an easy
choice to get out of.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you would just come, you know,
even if you're about to get in trouble,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's so much easier to deal with in court
without the, why did you run away?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, why did you leave them on a car
chase?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, why did you injure detective
so-and-so with your door?
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do that type of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just play it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, no, I burped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I want to be polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to just let it go into the
mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, it was directed towards you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you that Dr. Pepper state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those 23 Terps, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavors for dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavors for dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I pour other drinks in there.
25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, uh, interesting thing about the
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're getting pulled over by an
unmarked vehicle, would you pull over or
[SPEAKER_01]: would you call it in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm a, I'm a dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I can handle myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like for the most part,
I got pretty good judgment of what a cop
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I, I'm not trying to be sexist
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I were a small woman who wasn't as
fucking, wasn't six, five and 200 pounds,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some girls that I'm not even
trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pick some girls up and just
fucking carry them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was that size of a girl, I would,
I don't know, I'd reconsider my options.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just call 9-1-1 and be like,
Hey, is this cop that's pulling me over
[SPEAKER_04]: for real?
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll tell you if it is or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your hazard lights, slow way down,
get over all the way to the right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just do like four miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you call 9-1-1 and am I really being
pulled over?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm a tiny woman or I'm in a sketchy
part of town or da da da da.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't look like a cop car except for
the flashing lights and the windshield.
[SPEAKER_07]: 9-1-1 will know if you're being pulled
over.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's not, they'll send people to
pull over whoever's trying to pull you
[SPEAKER_07]: over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just sit there with your windows
up and wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do y'all remember when that was an issue?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, uh, it still is from time to time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like every now and then you'll see in the
police blotter was someone was arrested
[SPEAKER_07]: for, um, like a year ago it happened here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they pulled over a cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And immediately he was like, you ain't a
cop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, got out with his gun and was
like, somebody going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: In North Carolina, somebody was
impersonating as an officer and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and, uh, robbing people like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, would you, do you think that you
have to roll your window down all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: or can you just do it the next necessary
amount to talk and exchange?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is that being a douche?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you pushing the limit by not giving
them the full window?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, what, what are you trying to prove?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just roll it down and talk to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, cause if somebody's going to
assault you, they're doing it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: glass anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That glass ain't stopping though,
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I lick your ball sack today?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's why you play it cool from the
get-go so that the cop doesn't decide to
[SPEAKER_07]: play it the hardest way possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they could just decide to arrest you
and come through that window.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like just roll that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you put the weed in the back
seat or in the trunk, throw it in an extra
[SPEAKER_07]: bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a backpack so that your car doesn't
stink while you're on the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't have a roach burning in the ashtray
when you get pulled over.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Oseum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, man, I, I have to get on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't smoke and drive shit for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be careful with that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: DUIs are no fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do get fucking pulled over,
if you get fucked, get yourself a good
[SPEAKER_04]: lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't afford a lawyer, get the free
public defender one or go to a law school.
[SPEAKER_07]: In your area, nine times out of 10,
they've got a third year law student who
[SPEAKER_07]: would fucking love to defend the living
shit out of you for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't believe what all your pothead
friends are going to tell you and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they'll hype you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll get you scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll make you feel relaxed,
but they, they're just, they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: they are not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not a judge.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take their advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take your crazy uncle Larry's
advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go down there and tell them that you
are this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just carry a fake ID and get arrested as
somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've made it an hour with us,
that that's, that's a journey to time
[SPEAKER_07]: flies when there's a bunch of people at
the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it sure does.
[SPEAKER_04]: So does anybody have, uh, would you like
to shout out any social media or anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that you want to say,
since you've got a microphone in your face
[SPEAKER_04]: and some people is listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start going.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just go to the left here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got anything you'd like to say over
there, my friend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of quiet this episode, but it's all
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike had a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just hanging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for being here, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, why Mike?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be safe.
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't get, uh, don't get fucked by
being nervous.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do our friends follow you on social
media?

Twitter or, uh, Pueblo for sensible
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
Facebook.

[SPEAKER_04]: Click it, give it a like, follow it,
check out what Mike posts, share it,
[SPEAKER_04]: observe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do people should start paying attention to
politics?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get registered to vote?
[SPEAKER_07]: This next year is going to be interesting
in most states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if Randy ever listens to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor Randy and his little square dome.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he, uh, he doesn't read anything that
he does.
[SPEAKER_07]: He suspects might not be pre-approved.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really interesting way of educating
oneself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody, somebody shared this podcast
with Randy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let him learn the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move over to you,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming again, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you got to take time away from your
youngster to come hang out with us.

[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't know that was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay out the left lane people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dude, are you fucking serious?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just say that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm turning beat right over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying not to smack the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive 50 miles to and from work every
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 50 miles each way.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred miles on the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's one exit where I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably takes me 10 minutes just to
get on the damn on ramp because the
[SPEAKER_04]: construction in Colorado Springs right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you're in the left lane,
you should be passing somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I am behind you in the left lane and
you think I'm riding your ass,
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not an asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the left lane is for passing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That lane over there to the right is for
the slower moving traffic.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are big signs on the interstate that
say slower traffic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means fucking you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if I'm writing your, if I'm writing
your ass in the left lane, all it means is
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a conceited fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't flick your cigarette at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give me the finger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put on your damn blinker and move over and
let me zip past you and then get back to
[SPEAKER_04]: the thing is too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even care if you're going 10 miles
over and I'm trying to go 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, not to sound like, like a,
like fuck it, but the left lane is the go
[SPEAKER_01]: as fast as you please and risk getting a
ticket lane straight up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're passing people and then get back in
the right lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you pass somebody, get in the
right lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People be like, Oh, you're weaving a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, I'm driving correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out the left lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out the left lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a sign every five miles that says
keep right and less passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't be that, that social justice
warrior that tries to slow me down.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going too fast.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to pull in front of him.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not your road.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it is our road.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to get a ticket, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw water bottles at people straight
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've bumped a couple of people with water
bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how, not to do things now that
you've grown up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slappy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do that two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on Slappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slappy help us out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, nah, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, driving is driving is not a game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're playing with people's lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention sometimes when people do
stupid shit on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I drive a Prius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to get beat up by the guy
that was driving the Prius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause then you got to go home and lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be like, it was six guys in a
Jeep and then knows one dude with a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking Bob Ross Afro hopping out here and
whooping your ass out the Prius and then
[SPEAKER_01]: getting back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tattooed Bob Ross and a Prius beat my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then driving away and all yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello from the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adele.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to be tough when you pull up in
your car goes wing wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's where you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't hear the Prius pull up at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have literally had people in the car and
then drove off and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you started this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a long time.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out for this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence and until next time,
[SPEAKER_04]: take a fat dad and give your mama a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, this is a great episode in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: My good buddy Rob from Sour Seeds drop by
and we talk about selecting a male plant
[SPEAKER_04]: for breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let the music play for a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back, our good buddy Rob and
I will be sitting at the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am back with our good friend Rob from
Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing tonight, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taking the time out of your day.
Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're both busy cats, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a lot of things on your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: You looking forward to the Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be the first time we've spoke
about this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cannabis Cup that was planned for
Denver over the 420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver said no, they did not issue the
permits that were needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: High time's response was to move the
Cannabis Cup to Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is our location.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my town.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where this podcast is recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter where the podcast lands in
Pueblo, it will be 20 minutes from my
[SPEAKER_04]: house at maximum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a whole bunch of cool
people around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a whole bunch of cool
shit to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping to get a whole bunch of cool
people on the podcast since it's nearby.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can either come here and record in
the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, we'll get a whole bunch of cool
folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid to come, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people seem to be talking shit on
Facebook about Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the people that are talking shit have
never been here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm from Florida and I love it here,
so that tells you something right there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I landed here because of research.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's even worse.
[SPEAKER_14]: I landed here because of research.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I got here, I visited Denver.
[SPEAKER_14]: I visited Springs.
[SPEAKER_14]: I went south.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been all over for being here a short
amount of time in three years.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really love Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a nice, humble town.
[SPEAKER_14]: You get to know the people here.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver's too expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Springs is kind of a military vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a high crime too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in Springs now and I see a lot of
wonky shit on my breaks, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see some strange shit happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just watch the crazy ass local news,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always going down in Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple of parts of Pueblo that
I would not go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, this place is not
that bad, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So come hang out at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour Seeds should have a booth out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'll be running around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not do a booth this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have an Irish genetics t-shirt on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be running around having a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long ways away, but we're stoked
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cannabis Cup is coming to Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come see us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a lot of fun,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do a little show about
breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to do a show about selecting a
male plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, we're both coughing over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: What strain are you smoking on,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably some tut in common.
[SPEAKER_04]: The King Tut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells kind of a... It's got a unique
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very unique smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how to describe that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost reminded me of a specific
turpenoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember which one we decided it
smelled like anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Linalool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the heads up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never remember the name of linalool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always the one that I forget.
[SPEAKER_04]: That herb smells like it's got a lot of
linalool in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're choking over here because
we're getting high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm smoking some Terpex Sour Death Star
Wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Terpex crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a podcast about
selecting a male plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to breed some seeds,
there are a few things to look for in a
[SPEAKER_04]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say you buy yourself a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do it two 10 packs if you're
trying to do a phenohunt to find a male,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not everybody's got the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to do at least two 10 packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's power in numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're phenohunting, the more plants,
the better.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 to 50 is a good number.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can usually find super plants in 20 to
50, just astounding keepers that stand
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can't do that many at a time,
just do them in phases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do 10, find a keeper out of that 10,
do 10 more, find the best out of those
[SPEAKER_04]: two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of those 10, and then you got two to
stack up against each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep doing it until your room is full and
then start eliminating shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I even sometimes I do it from seeds right
out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can kind of tell, you know,
you have those seeds that just look like
[SPEAKER_14]: they're going to have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to struggle.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can tell whenever they open the
shell, they have the little tiny leaves or
[SPEAKER_14]: sometimes they're mutated or doesn't look
as strong or vibrant as the others.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just go ahead and chuck them right out
of the gate.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a breeder, as somebody who is,
I've read a lot of plants and if you were
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for a male plant, you're going to
have to learn to get rid of some plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and not be too attached to your babies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be ruthless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be ruthless.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are little baby plants and you are
creating the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do not pull those ugly little
fuckers, you are going to ruin and fuck up
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're going to retard the progression
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to water the genetics down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're breeding to improve the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a plant, you start a bunch
of seeds, you got a couple that are kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of wonky looking, you got one with the
fucked up leaf, don't be afraid to get rid
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: As they grow, keep a good eye on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we get to that part,
let's talk about what the male plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to bring to our breeding project.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we hit a male plant with pollen to a
female plant that accepts pollen that has
[SPEAKER_04]: pistols, it's going to create seeds that
are going to have traits of both plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the male mostly going to bring to
the table here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's going to bring a lot of
the pest resistance and a lot of the vigor
[SPEAKER_14]: and a lot of the shape.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really a lot of what it is,
the hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And without that male side of the family,
you really can't catch that true hard
[SPEAKER_14]: vigor like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always tell people all the time,
you can't create Halle berries by
[SPEAKER_14]: eliminating half the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way you put that.
[SPEAKER_04]: People will catch on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we need the male to bring that
good structure and the resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of the flavor comes from
mama.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes from the girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're looking for structure and
shape, a lot of it is going to come from
[SPEAKER_04]: the boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we can talk a little bit about what
to look for in a male plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep saying the structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like a male plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're breeding a sativa, you're going
to want one that gets a little bit taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're in veg, the males are always
going to start taking off a little taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their goal is to get above the females so
that when they pollinate, their pollen
[SPEAKER_04]: falls down onto the girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a good hint.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're growing in veg, look for that
one that's taken off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a boy for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're looking for, if you've got a
sativa, you want the one that keeps not
[SPEAKER_04]: too tall and doesn't take off too much
because you don't want to make your
[SPEAKER_04]: progeny skyrocket immediately,
but you want to find the one that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: right shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost want to find what you want your
girls to look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the boy to look the shape to be
what you want your females to look like,
[SPEAKER_04]: is what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So look for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want tight, close node spacing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want a whole bunch of gaps
between your branches.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it when a plant spits out
really long branches like Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was about to come right out of my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_14]: The OG family, the whole family over there
on that side, even Grape Stomper OG and
[SPEAKER_14]: some of the other ones that are hybrids,
most of them take off because of the boys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you're saying, the structure,
it comes from the male is a perfect
[SPEAKER_14]: example.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Joseph male that Gage uses,
everything they cross that, great male by
[SPEAKER_14]: the way, but it comes out tall.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the times you get mostly dominant
phenotypes of stretchy plants because of
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's stretchy with little popcorn balls
coming off everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a dominant OG male and that's what's
going on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's that structure taking over the
dominance from that male plant and it's
[SPEAKER_14]: the OG dominance.
[SPEAKER_14]: The cushions have always had that
dominance and it really is an Afghan
[SPEAKER_14]: heritage.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just trace back.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's recessive Afghan genes that are
really strong and they're always going to
[SPEAKER_14]: come forward and breed true unless you
find a dominant gene from a different side
[SPEAKER_14]: of the family that breeds just as hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like something from Blue Dream,
for example, good example of a good
[SPEAKER_14]: breeding parent or White Widow used to be
a really good breeding parent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've bred the White Widow with two other
strains and it does very well.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what you're doing at that time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're taking a diversity of genotypes
from different parts of the world,
[SPEAKER_14]: Brazil, South America, things like that,
and then diversifying them against things
[SPEAKER_14]: like OG cushions, which are originally
derivative Afghan, places like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're mostly converged into California,
East Coast, places with coastlines,
[SPEAKER_14]: and then out.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the stuff that started off in the
Dutch genetics has those real thin leaves
[SPEAKER_04]: because it was all bred for indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where you see a lot of Brazilian
and Sativa genetics and then Nepal and
[SPEAKER_14]: things like that, Nepalese genetics,
Moroccan genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: You see a lot of Spain, a lot of Spanish
genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where you see an influx of that in
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a shout out to Gage Green
Genetics since we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: Grape Stomper OG there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys finally took home a cannabis
cup for the Grape Stomper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good work, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing but love and respect for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gage Green, MK4, and Keyplay, the whole
crew, they helped me get a little start in
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for something that doesn't get too
tall, too crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for an indica,
if you're trying to breed an indica male,
[SPEAKER_04]: find the shortest, stoutest, squattiest
one you can find, probably with those big,
[SPEAKER_04]: fattest leaves you can find, those dinner
plate leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can camp out under those leaves,
if you can almost make a hammock under
[SPEAKER_04]: those leaves, that'd be a sweet male to
breed with if you're looking for a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: indica plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want something with nice,
nice, tight, close node spacing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can find a male plant,
you got to flower them out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to veg them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start looking for, note their structure in
veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to get them too tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a clone off of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Label the clone that matches the,
so clone A to plant A, clone B to plant B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flower your plants out.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got females and you're looking
for males, you can just go ahead and toss
[SPEAKER_04]: the females, or you can finish them out
and have some buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will take my male plants and flower them
all the way out to see what they do,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way to like seven, eight,
maybe nine weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if they're going to produce
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if they're going to produce
a whole bunch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if they're just,
some plants will only produce a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a breeder, you can see which pollen
will be, there's kind of grainy pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like that pollen's worth a
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the pre-pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the pollen before your plants
actually start busting out, that real
[SPEAKER_04]: grainy, dusty shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to let that, if you're going to
collect pollen, let that fall,
[SPEAKER_04]: let that get away, and then collect that
like, it's about 14 days into the
[SPEAKER_04]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about 10 to 14 days into when they
bust open.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when the really good pollen starts
coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little softer, a little smoother to
the touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's spraying all over those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's letting them go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if your plant is producing trichomes
and a whole bunch of resin and has the
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect structure, you want to breed with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to rub the stem and smell the stem
of my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it smells like puke, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those plants, when you, for some
reason, when it's got a hint of bar trash
[SPEAKER_04]: can and vomit, that's a good male to breed
with.
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of that, when you smell that stem,
and if it's a male, you can go across the
[SPEAKER_14]: board and say you have a bunch in a row.
[SPEAKER_14]: From your phenome hunt that you're doing,
put them all next to each other.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sit down, smell each one of them side by
side.
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sure you're cleaning your hands each
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really good profile of what each one's
doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually, the one that stinks the worst is
the best one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Typically, and then you narrow it down by
smell, and then narrow it down by
[SPEAKER_14]: structure, site.
[SPEAKER_14]: Use all your senses.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't eliminate anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Feel free to take a leaf and snap one off
and taste the stem a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's sour and tarty and stuff,
a lot of the times, and you're using
[SPEAKER_14]: hardly no nutrients at all, it's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's telling you, I got a lot of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a lot to add to the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: The male is definitely going to contribute
to the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the mama definitely overwhelms the
flavor category, but the male is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: contribute to the amount of flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't want to just use any old male.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to use the best one you can at
any and all costs.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just one of those things that we
look for, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you best a 10-pack of seeds,
you'll probably find maybe five males,
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully, five females, five males.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to toss two of those right
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is going to be funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is going to be a runt,
so those go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you got three.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally know that I never use that
first plant to show me male flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to take that first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's too dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like he's going to do too much to
my breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the plants are going to look like that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I've got three of them, I kind of would
lean toward the third one to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had five males that worked well,
probably that third or fourth one would be
[SPEAKER_04]: the one that I would use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't go right for that first one
that busted out because it's too obvious.
[SPEAKER_14]: Me, I always choose it honestly.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I'm doing my breeding, I always
choose it based on what the mother is
[SPEAKER_14]: doing or what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm trying to, say, if I'm out crossing
a blue dream or a sativa or something
[SPEAKER_14]: close to it that has a longer flowering
time and I want to come in with an indica
[SPEAKER_14]: and actually shorten his flowering time,
then that's when I would choose a male
[SPEAKER_14]: that's bust out first because I want to
take that flowering time and cut it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cut it down with that dominant
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: If, say, you have a little indica
dominant, but you want to make it a true
[SPEAKER_14]: hybrid and you want to make it go a little
bit longer in the garden, say,
[SPEAKER_14]: more if it's a seven, eight week and you
want it to go more like eight,
[SPEAKER_14]: nine, maybe 10-ish or something like that,
then that's another reason you'd go with a
[SPEAKER_14]: longer flowering male.
[SPEAKER_14]: Same instance, just vice versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid to have plants that flower
for a long time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know nine, 10, and 11 weeks sounds like
scary flowering times, but I flowered
[SPEAKER_04]: plants for 14 and 15 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is amazing once they get that
ripe and that far in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sour diesel is a good example of that,
going that long 10, 11 weeks on it,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it's well worth it in the end.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you're getting a connoisseur
product that you can't gain anywhere else
[SPEAKER_14]: and the test results will show you the
rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: The harvest weights come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it well worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an African land race that didn't
have a name and it grew colas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cut it down in week 14 and the colas
were bigger than my legs.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's the biggest complication
with all growers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Young to old is patience.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think it's the hardest thing we
all have to overcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just in life.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: In general.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to choke and then we're going to
keep this moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to beatbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, you should have.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might not even edit it now since you're
beatboxing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might just leave that part right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do you want to add to that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got anything that you want to add to
talking about selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_14]: That we pretty much covered.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, use all your senses and breed for
a purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Breed for purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: Breed for purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: All because of it's good and you want to
bang it together with something else that
[SPEAKER_14]: just looks good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just don't do it just because to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or don't do it because you got a cool name
lined up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it for purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it for purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: We see too much of that in the industry
every day that you got to create the
[SPEAKER_14]: strain, come up with the name lastly.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do make something and it sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say you make a strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got this male and then you've got
this prized female.
[SPEAKER_04]: You throw a pollen all over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You let it go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you pollinate, it's going to take
you about six more weeks until the seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: are ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe six or eight more weeks before we
can chop that plant down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I let the plants dry until they're crispy.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, I just chop them down and
let them get super crispy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just rub them and the seeds
fall out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I go collect all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I blast the material into oil,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then you got to grow those seeds
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would recommend you grow a hundred of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just at least germinate a hundred of them
right away and see what they do before you
[SPEAKER_04]: give any of them away to anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Germinate a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Veg out at least 50 and flower at least 25
of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry them, cure them, smoke them.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it sucks, flush the seeds down the
toilet and get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feed them to your birds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes things just don't want to breed
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a strain that totally sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It produced giant colas that tasted
amazing, but it would not get you high at
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can smoke the entire crop and there's
no high at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm guilty of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: My main thing was breeding.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had one recently that came out was the
Dante's Inferno.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a big hit for a lot of people
because a lot of people, there are
[SPEAKER_14]: connoisseur smokers out there that like
growing things like grinspoon and other
[SPEAKER_14]: strains out there that are just absolutely
100% top grade connoisseur weed that yield
[SPEAKER_14]: like crap.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Girl Scout cookies, I mean,
it's not even known for its yield.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's known for its power and its flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: That peppery sweet funk taste.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're not growing that as a cash
crop.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, at a lot of the times you're
growing that for personal.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you are growing it for cash crop,
you have a lot of room and a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Gavita somewhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, warehouse style.
[SPEAKER_14]: What were we even talking about to get a
snap?
[SPEAKER_14]: Males.
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, I did have something I wanted
to add to the mails.
[SPEAKER_14]: Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Breeding for terps.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of our perfect ones is coming up now.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be one of our big front
runners is the S1 version of our blueberry
[SPEAKER_14]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_14]: This cut has amazing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really, really hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got a little bit of everything in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason that is because when you're
choosing males and females and you're
[SPEAKER_14]: doing that breeding work, you know,
actually look at their terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't know and you can get it
tested, spend the 40, 50, 75 bucks,
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever it takes, get it tested.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have paperwork to back your stuff
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in a legal state, you should be
able to get your stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the more widely it's becoming
nowadays, you have literally half the
[SPEAKER_14]: country now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or 50, 50 and it's taken over and you
should be able to get it tested by
[SPEAKER_14]: someone, somehow, somewhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: Forums, you know, use your connections,
reach out and then get it done.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can find out like a terpene
profile and then try to match it up with
[SPEAKER_14]: something that absolutely would compliment
those terpenes, but doesn't have them like
[SPEAKER_14]: our blueberry fuel.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have blue dream, which is a good
clone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Only good breeding parent breeds true.
[SPEAKER_14]: It breeds solid.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't, it's known to breed stable.
[SPEAKER_14]: I bred a couple good strains with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you can pop 100, 200 seeds and
you might get one or two Hermes out of it
[SPEAKER_14]: just because it breeds that stable.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and it usually takes the dominance of
things, but when you breed it with
[SPEAKER_14]: something like OGs and diesels and things
like that, you add a whole different
[SPEAKER_14]: terpene profile that really compliments
the blueberry muffiny hues and the blend
[SPEAKER_14]: and the creaminess of the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just stands out and it creates a whole
nother animal.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you don't even, most people,
when you smoke it with them first,
[SPEAKER_14]: tell them what it is lastly.
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't ever even would have guessed
it came from.
[SPEAKER_14]: From blue dream.
[SPEAKER_14]: They look at it, never would have thought
and taste it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Never would have thought.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just peels them back.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got, you know, diesels, it's got OG
tones.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got blueberry tones.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got creamy tones in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just, it's off the hook,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've smoked some of that with you
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you brought that last time and it
was definitely a tasty strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that was what you brought for me to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've noticed everything I breed to the
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never used it as a male, obviously,
cause it's a clone only and it's a girl,
[SPEAKER_04]: but everything I've bred to it,
it is made huge colas, everything you put
[SPEAKER_14]: to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it too.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we did the OG cross on it
typically was to actually gain a little
[SPEAKER_14]: bit of extra yield on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because OGs are lanky and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to put more, I bred grateful
dog to the blue dream and I call it the
[SPEAKER_04]: blue healer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my point was to put more vigor to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make it a little bit bigger,
a little chunkier, but I'm not a fan of
[SPEAKER_04]: the flavor of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's girl weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes like stripper weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like a bland blueberry.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's real muffiny and real creamy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a, it tastes like Jiffy muffins
smell.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like in the oven when you get the
Jiffy muffins, you put the blueberry
[SPEAKER_14]: muffins in and it kind of has that aroma
blueberry muffiny blueberry air freshener
[SPEAKER_14]: instead of blueberry candies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or like that blueberry marker.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just smell the markers in class.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just gave me a weird flashback,
but yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put that to the grateful dog and it
made it more pungent and more more piney.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it brought out a bottom layer of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bred it to the, uh, King Kim crossed the
grapestomper OG and we call it the,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the, well, it's the blue stomper,
but, uh, that one made it much stinkier
[SPEAKER_04]: and that the, uh, King Kim grapestomper OG
made little tiny popcorns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it makes spears since we put it to
the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what I tell people all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I know you've had it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's been around for a long time,
held 15 years now, but, uh, don't count it
[SPEAKER_14]: out as a breeding mother with hybrids.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, don't see blue dream on the
label and automatically turn it away
[SPEAKER_14]: because you're probably passing up a
really, really good cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people that do not like
blue dream at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say your names on the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up boys?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a lot of the nightmare lines people
fell in love with and things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why they called it nightmare.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do you think nightmare dream?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, put, put two and two together.
[SPEAKER_14]: People didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you tell them like, no, there's no
blue dream in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something important I should mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, uh, this is kind of a breeding by
eye technique here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could make Elial charts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could take a whole bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should take a whole bunch,
a whole bunch of notes either way,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is kind of just a breeding,
a breeding with love, grow from your
[SPEAKER_04]: heart, sort of, uh, do it by your eye,
old school sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're breeding with a lot of experience
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if you find a good male,
you're going to want to do a phenohunt of
[SPEAKER_04]: at least 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to want to find one with a
good structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want it to look, you want it to have
this shape that you want the babies to
[SPEAKER_04]: have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, find one that makes resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can find one that makes a whole
bunch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't make enough pollen,
you're not going to make enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, find one with real close node spacing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find one that smells real good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try not to select the very first one that
goes into flower and shows you that it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely do not use any male plants that
show any sign of hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Male plants can hermaphrodite also.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see little male sacks popping out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then right out of the sides,
you'll see female pistols come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not, those aren't nut hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to cut fucking Bruce Jenner down
and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get Bruce Jenner out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ain't trying to have no none of that
shit in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will create lots of problems in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not want to breed hermaphrodism
into your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not a good, that's, that's the
exact opposite of what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pay attention to that pollen you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the pollen does start spitting,
you don't want that first grainy sandy
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want that, the pollen will,
when you catch some of it and put it in
[SPEAKER_04]: your hand and rub it in the palm of your
hand, it'll feel smooth and silky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll feel real nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you leave the grow room,
you're going to have to hose yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: down, get a mister, uh, like a sprayer and
spray, like a pump sprayer, like you'd
[SPEAKER_04]: almost used to pump pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get one of those and just spray yourself
down and wash your hands because tap water
[SPEAKER_14]: works really great.
[SPEAKER_14]: It has chlorine, it's safe for everything,
plants, animals, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll deactivate any pollen that you've
got on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you are going from that pollen
room into a room that has female plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can always hose them down as you walk
in, just hit them with the sprayer and
[SPEAKER_04]: they won't receive pollen for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trying to prevent that pollen from
getting onto your females.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to breed, because if you
have a male plant in the house or in the
[SPEAKER_04]: room or in the facility with your females,
it's going to try to get pollen
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I've noticed, or you could tell
me if you've recognized this, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got separate breeding rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got an upstairs and a downstairs area
and an area over here and an area over
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I've got a male in one area and
females in a totally different area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed when I've got girls and a
flowering male in the same house,
[SPEAKER_04]: the girls get a little stickier and they
flower a little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think those girls know there's a
male around somewhere?
[SPEAKER_14]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes into some of my Forte lighting and
it actually, yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_14]: They know because of infrared lighting.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Plants use infrared lighting to see around
them.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why you have natural spacing and
the woods.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is why trees naturally space
themselves out, naturally weed out smaller
[SPEAKER_14]: ones below them and around them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you typically go into the woods and
new pine tree forest and things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have an equal spacing between
trees.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is why.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So infrared lighting, my horny,
my horny girl plants know they're blowing
[SPEAKER_14]: his load.
[SPEAKER_14]: They know she's like, I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's pheromones, I believe as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would believe that because well,
they can take in CO2 and they can,
[SPEAKER_14]: they breathe out carbon dioxide,
you know, there's always a constant intake
[SPEAKER_14]: between oxygen and carbon dioxide battling
back and forth, back and forth,
[SPEAKER_14]: back and forth.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of it, they're annual plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they've built over thousands and
millions of years, they have built defense
[SPEAKER_14]: mechanisms to try to breed.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is their purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why they hermaphrodite on us.
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody remembers the first Jurassic
park, how I used to say nature will always
[SPEAKER_14]: find a way.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you all of a sudden you have
eggs.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is why, because nature will always
find a way.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're talking about something that is
on a total different level than what you
[SPEAKER_14]: think.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's mind boggling to think how you know,
in evolution sense, how far ahead some
[SPEAKER_14]: plants are than what we are.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we, we tend to think we're the
kings of the world, you know, we're the
[SPEAKER_14]: center of the universe every day of the
week.
[SPEAKER_14]: But really, if you look at an ant,
if he was our size, you could lift your
[SPEAKER_14]: house.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can lift like 500 times their natural
weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, smile at you with one arm
holding your house.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's, it's really more about
perception than anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just fucked with all the listeners
heads and others visualizing an ant
[SPEAKER_04]: lifting up my house and running away with
it while we're in here recording.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, but it is in reality, when you put it
that way, I mean, it's how you perceive
[SPEAKER_14]: things.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just pretty, it's pretty wild,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a wild universe out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole plant's mission is to survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, man, you got anything else you
want to add to this podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like we've covered selecting a
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that made a lot of sense to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want everybody to show up and,
uh, show Denver, uh, that, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: we can do this better than they can.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, I think the people of Pueblo are
going to show them that we've held the
[SPEAKER_14]: state fair here for how long.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, somebody we know actually made a
good point on social media that,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, it's, uh, 11 days long, 25,000 people
a day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody can do a Pueblo County can do
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can host that many folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got enough hotels, eating places.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I actually plan to put together
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted it up to social media,
asking my local friends for a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of help.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Together and be a little bit of a tour
guide for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to find places for you to stay
places for you to eat things for you to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, give you a little bit of information
about our town so that, uh, when you come
[SPEAKER_04]: here, you're prepared and then we can all
have a good time and take a bunch of dads
[SPEAKER_04]: and be friends and you'll have a good time
with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be such a blast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'm proud to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm proud to have landed in this spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we're holding the greatest party
in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people talk a lot of trash,
but look what's about to happen here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest cannabis event on the planet
is going to be here in our backyard.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's going to be a blast,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's going to be a blast because I
have fun everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be, yeah, it's going to be
there and I'm going to be there and Jesse
[SPEAKER_04]: and Spencer is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do we need, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spencer competing this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak for Spencer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Garden of Weed, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it, boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Matty and the whole Garden of
Weed crew and Spence and the doggies.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, Siroc, boy?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Nana?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody's doing well over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just gave shout outs to dogs on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you guys follow my buddy Sour
Seeds on social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can people find you, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: Find us on Twitter.

[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get our hat pins and get custom
links right to our sites that sell our
[SPEAKER_14]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, thanks for the hat pins.
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought me a nice little selection of
hat pins.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like the dab scraper.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: I enjoy the heart, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I enjoy doing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just keeps everything fresh,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are your products available on thedankteam
.com at this time?
[SPEAKER_14]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got to get you in touch with our
buddies over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yankee needs to talk to you, but make sure
you guys check out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them know that we sent you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of iRegenetic stuff
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some Black Cherry Kim available up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is damn good, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grew some over at Grain and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be on the shelves by the time this
podcast comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll very likely be gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just made some of the best
concentrates I've had in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_14]: dude, honestly.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'd say top five that I've tasted.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just the flavors off.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can taste the cherry.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can taste the Kim.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That Black Cherry comes through.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like some of my two favorite,
two favorite terms right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why shit happens, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's how breeding happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see two strains and a breeder that's
bred as many times as we have,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, oh, if I put that to that,
it's like becoming a chef.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a weird chef almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an art.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is some artistry involved in it and
don't ever let us think that we're taking
[SPEAKER_14]: that away.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just pure science.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's art to all of it, extractions,
growing, breeding especially.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a good eye and a little bit of
heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to listen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to lay down next to them and
listen to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to feel the vibe from the plants
help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, bro, thank you for coming out.
Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for rolling some joints and smoking
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll hit that sucker again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You looked at me like, you want to hit
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit a joint, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys fill your head with thoughts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I fill my head with smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think I don't smoke a lot of flour,
but I've been smoking a lot of flour
[SPEAKER_02]: lately.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm guilty of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I didn't just ask.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just passing Bogart and over here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get to that level, you just hold
on to a joint for a few minutes and smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are my new cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll smoke it for a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, congrats on not smoking
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 21 years clean, sober, do it, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have you not had a cigarette now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost two months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost two months.
[SPEAKER_04]: We mentioned that you had a problem one
night on the show, and we didn't talk too
[SPEAKER_04]: much about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said that you were planning on
coming, but you had a little issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_14]: He smoked too much.
[SPEAKER_14]: He collapsed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Long will happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn, son.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm way glad you're repaired and
back in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look good, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm breathing good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go run some laps?
[SPEAKER_14]: I could track you like you could.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for spending some time with
me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap up this part of the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a bunch of dads,
I'm going to get a fresh drink,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I will be back to wrap up this
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys, that was a lesson in
how to select male plants for breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you learned something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to send another huge thank you

[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for taking some time away from the

[SPEAKER_04]: away from the new baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy to, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard the kid ate potatoes today.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did.
[SPEAKER_07]: First potatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the baby and the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a big shout out to the wife for

but thanks to Mike's wife for letting Mike
[SPEAKER_04]: come play.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you letting me borrow your
husband for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll quit talking about babies and we'll
get on with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, thanks for jumping in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big shout out to my
friend, John Anthony Moses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're hanging out, listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, let's get into the big topic that's
been going on here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis cup was supposed to be in
Denver on 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposed to, but unfortunately the city of
Denver declined all of the permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver officials declined all the permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not allowed to host the event
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adams County, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, they said, nope, not going to
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some issues, namely out of state
dispensaries handing out samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what was supposed to be 14,000 people
a day actually being 35,000 people a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, they said, no, not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been following this one close.
[SPEAKER_04]: High times came down to Pueblo,
Colorado, where Mike and I reside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They claimed they were going to do the
festival on the 18th, 19th, 20th,
[SPEAKER_04]: 21st, within that range.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the original goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put up flyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put out some announcements on their
website.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put out some stuff on Twitter,
Instagram and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then suddenly they retracted all of
their statements and said, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: the next weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the permits have been entered.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been submitted.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being reviewed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far the city of Pueblo has not said if
they are going to allow or decline the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cup to happen in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode will come out in two or three
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty sure the decision will not
be made at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now there is no definite location
for the high times cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it does happen, it will be moved to
the weekend of the 22nd and the 23rd if it
[SPEAKER_04]: does happen in Pueblo, Colorado at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I read something today claiming that this
move was, it was sort of an option B if
[SPEAKER_07]: Adams County didn't go through and they'd
been looking for bigger locations than the
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver Mart and the location down here in
Pueblo claims to be able to handle the 25
[SPEAKER_07]: or 30,000 people a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not too familiar with the location.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Denver Mart was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, when I heard that it was
going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: a huge chunk of money out of going to the
cup for people that just want to go to the
[SPEAKER_07]: cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to go up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to get a hotel room.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to be driving back home to
Pueblo after the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a multiple day event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go to every day just because
that's how I, if you're trying to go to
[SPEAKER_07]: all three days or have to go to all three
days, you got to be up there for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, paying top dollar for hotel
rooms right now in Denver sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every, all of the shitty hotels go
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think you're going to pay 70 or 80
for a hotel, those 70 and $80 hotels are
[SPEAKER_04]: now 130 on cannabis cup weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every hotel in Denver knows that 420 is a
big weekend in Denver and they cash the
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, a bunch of people have
already booked plane tickets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have booked rooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: They booked cars.
[SPEAKER_07]: The big complaint about the cup in Denver
was always that the planning was sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: like a D minus, like the roof didn't fall
in, like nobody got squashed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, it was kind of a
clusterfuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when they changed their mind that
they weren't going to do it in Denver and
[SPEAKER_04]: they decided to move it to Pueblo,
a lot of people were like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pueblo has got an interesting reputation
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we sure do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sure do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when they pushed the date to a
completely different weekend, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that a large portion of the people that
were going to attend just decided,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't even going to try.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the cup goes off in Pueblo,
because it's not at all a sure thing at
[SPEAKER_07]: this point, folks, it's the decision comes
down to the county planning department.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if they decide yes, it can be
appealed.
[SPEAKER_07]: By any number of people in our local
sheriff has told the press that if it's
[SPEAKER_07]: approved, he's going to appeal because he
doesn't, he doesn't have any idea how he's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to handle 35,000 cannabis cup
attendees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not because of the number of attendees,
but because they're attending the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something about the event makes it
special.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be too high to drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be too high to drive is
what I saw in a statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really scared of dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the average, to a normal person who's
never seen cannabis and sees me pull out a
[SPEAKER_04]: torch and heat up a nail and do this crack
like looking drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand the fear, but he's a
police officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a sheriff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to figure out what's going on
with the medical marijuana community and
[SPEAKER_04]: be in touch with us and come join us
instead of be afraid of us and try to
[SPEAKER_04]: persecute us and prosecute us.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spend 10 minutes talking to any member of
the community and we will cease to be
[SPEAKER_07]: scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a peaceful dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may look intimidating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may say a lot of big, crazy,
weird words.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it comes down to it, I'm a
peaceful, chilled out dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd love to sit down and have a
conversation with anybody who needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: educated properly about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the show's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis edumacation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what today is.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of hilarity, I think,
in this story.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at some of the reasons stated
and quoted that the permits up in Denver
[SPEAKER_07]: were denied, the two big reasons that are
cited over and over and over again in the
[SPEAKER_07]: press are, A, a woman jumped out of her
car, like somewhere in or around the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis cup where she had just attended
or was on her way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really specify, but clearly
marijuana use doesn't cause jumping out of
[SPEAKER_07]: cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado sold almost a billion dollars
with weed last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it caused jumping out of cars,
we would know.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people have a medical marijuana
car?
[SPEAKER_04]: 112,000 or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have a good bet in saying I smoke
more cannabis than 90% of the people on
[SPEAKER_04]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not an effect we wouldn't see for
years down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: If cannabis made you jump out of cars,
I would have done backflips out of buses
[SPEAKER_04]: by now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were 35,000 people a day at the cup
and one woman jumped out of a car.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not exactly event-related.
[SPEAKER_04]: They forgot to mention in the article that
she took a dab and then she went and did a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole bunch of molly and that she drank
whiskey.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only ever heard of a chick jumping
out of a car one other time and she was
[SPEAKER_07]: stone sober and fighting with her
boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of non-consumed- Were you
the boyfriend?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was friends with the boyfriend and they
showed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a long story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not fucking telling it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't drug or alcohol-related.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, I can't be in this car another
minute fucking crazy this longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do come to Colorado and you come to
Pueblo, if we do have the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_04]: here, please behave yourself, represent
yourself as a positive cannabis user and a
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be looking for people
driving too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the exact rule here,
but they treat cannabis like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to be leaving the cannabis
cup, have your cannabis in a sealed
[SPEAKER_04]: container.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can put it in the trunk of your
car, put your rig, your dabber,
[SPEAKER_04]: your carb cap, your torch, and especially
your product, any product you've got
[SPEAKER_04]: that's smokable, edible, drinkable.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's cannabis infused related,
if you can rub it on your balls,
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in the trunk of the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have a trunk, if you've got
an SUV, put it in the backpack,
[SPEAKER_04]: zip the backpack up, put it way in the
back of the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have it out of reach of the driver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get yourself a DUI or an illegal
possession of cannabis ticket because that
[SPEAKER_04]: is still a possible thing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This cannabis cup, if it goes off in
Pueblo, is going to be under a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, Pueblo could use the cup down
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd really like to see the event do well
if it gets approved at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see it do well.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the big complaints in Adams County
was out of state dispensaries coming here
[SPEAKER_07]: and selling weed and dabs at their booths.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them were doing donation,
legal mumbo jumbo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people were straight doing sales,
at least according to recent reports.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big no-no here, which is why none
of our local dispensaries were even
[SPEAKER_07]: handing out product at the cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get that the cup is supposed to be the
community gathering and celebrating and
[SPEAKER_07]: having a huge smoke out, but how you hand
out samples or what people bring to smoke,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a lot of rules around that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to know the law and please try to
comply with it as much as practicable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't fuck it up for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've worked really hard here to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a good thing going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to be a dick about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come, when you're at the event,
take dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Share your dabs with your friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a fat dab with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: High-five me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take some selfies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get on Instagram together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's Snapchat at the fuck up,
but be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're driving away from there,
keep your cannabis safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your eyes not red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be able to walk the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be able to pass the tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, we did the episode a little
while back about interacting with law
[SPEAKER_04]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be prepared for that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a nervous person, don't be extra
high and nervous when you're leaving the
[SPEAKER_04]: cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang out for an extra hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take a couple dabs, hang out for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I went back and listened to that
episode, the one thing I realized that I
[SPEAKER_07]: meant to emphasize and didn't was the
easiest way to not get in trouble with law
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcement and to be calm and cool during
those interactions is to not be breaking
[SPEAKER_07]: the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something my buddy Lewis,
shout out Magoo, he goes, you know what
[SPEAKER_04]: you forgot to fucking mention was don't
have fucking expired plates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have your tags expired.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a broken headlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a broken tail light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a cracked windshield.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said break one rule at a time was his
advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Magoo for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up in a lawyer family.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't figured that out yet by
now, I don't know if you've been
[SPEAKER_07]: listening, but that's an old lawyer joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got to break the law,
I'll break one law at a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking true.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got weed in the car and you
ain't allowed to have weed, make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: that's the only rule you're breaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're speeding, you're asking to get
caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a fucked up car,
you're asking to get caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a lot of states, if you look like Jeff,
you're asking to get caught.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the listeners don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: This gets pointed out to me occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some listeners don't know this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people meet me or they hear my voice
somewhere and they turn around and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, is that you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I go to the grocery store
sometimes and people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, that's fucking you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am six foot five and I've got dreadlocks
almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not even joking.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dreadlocks go damn near to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can close them in the car door.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to roll them up in the car window,
but now they're so long that that shit
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't even thought about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Testify for me, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: These fucking things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a gentle weave, they could be like a
legit hammock or blanket.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here is bigger around than my
torch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've watched them steal things from other
people's hands without Jeff's knowledge or
[SPEAKER_07]: consent.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dreads will clean off a table.
[SPEAKER_07]: They work like a bullet from time to time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really long.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I need space at a concert, I just shake
the dreadlocks around a little bit and
[SPEAKER_04]: then no one wants my dreadlocks in their
face and or their beer, so they just back
[SPEAKER_04]: the fuck up and give me some dancing room.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Colorado, it's not that unusual to see
some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really unusual to see locks this
long.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, in other states, you're a
walking advertisement for a dude that's
[SPEAKER_07]: high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you should see me try to go through
the TSA, going through the airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They inspect my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fucking want to squeeze them and see
what's in there, honey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, if you're coming to the
cannabis cup, be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look out at the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do a shameless shout out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since the cannabis cup in Denver will not
be on the day of 420, everyone's looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for something to do on 420 in Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a huge shout out to an
event called the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Secret Sesh will be happening at the
Gatsby Gardens in Denver, Colorado on 420,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I do invite you to join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: For more information, you're going to have
to follow the Secret Sesh Colorado on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Search them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get a website going.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our homie Adam Ill will be coming out to
DJ or not to DJ to host the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I can announce who the DJ
will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know who the DJ is, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've got him lined up,
but I don't want to say the name of the DJ
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show here and get everybody pumped
up because it's a good DJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys will recognize his name when I
say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a fan of the podcast,
you might know who I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it is not Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to cross that one off.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people might think I have Nicka T
coming to DJ in an event, but we do not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get the Secret Sesh packed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have a topic for this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just going to be two high guys
taking dabs and rambling.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friend, she calls herself that one
mountain girl, sent me a message on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram and she said, hey, you guys
should do a message about how to get your
[SPEAKER_04]: badge in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to that one mountain girl
for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, big shout out for following me on
IG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, today, and today it happened to a lot
of people, but I noticed several Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: accounts got wiped the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The green and healthy wellness Instagram
account for the shop, buh-bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turpex account for their hash,
buh-bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid to open mine right now and look
if it's even there because, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's my crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow the herb for green and healthy,
and then it's blasted by turpex and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: all tagged in the same posts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like my time's coming on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if it disappears, I'll just
create a Rasta Jeff Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't even be iRegenetics anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be Rasta Jeff this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be the second iRegenetics Instagram
to get blasted down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'll just make a Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it disappears, I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to post pictures of what's going on
and interact with my friends and my family
[SPEAKER_04]: out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to that one mountain
girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, shout out to my friend Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: She kind of encouraged me to write this
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is a manager at a very prominent
dispensary in the Colorado Springs area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to her and her staff and her
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say the name of the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a mini shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a shout out, Jess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big love, big hugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jess was like, you should do an
episode because people- We had a friend
[SPEAKER_07]: doing this, going through the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought about, we should do a show
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Jessica deals with people at the
dispensary every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one person a day asks, how do we-
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike works at a dispensary too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike and Jess both have one person a
day say, how do I get a badge?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I get a badge?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I get a badge?
[SPEAKER_04]: So now all they have to do is refer that
person to this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome new listener.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you learned about the podcast by
somebody saying, hey, listen to that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll learn how to get your badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Across the table is my buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to teach you how to get your
badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to open the notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says how to get your badge in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is how to get a Colorado
Marijuana Enforcement Division badge so
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're able to work in a legal,
recreational, and or medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be a dispensary where you're
either rolling joints all day,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to be- There's a million
different types of jobs at dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: But be prepared to start at the bottom of
the ladder kind of regardless.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like unless you're coming with too many
bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anything you're going to do in there,
you need a badge from the owner to the bud
[SPEAKER_04]: tender, to the joint roller, to the dude
who paints the walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the lawyer needs a badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guys that come in and build the place
have to get either real badges or visitor
[SPEAKER_04]: badges.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the people that work for the
dispensary, the grows, the processing
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities where extracts are made,
the facilities where edibles and
[SPEAKER_04]: drinkables are made, the places where
topicals are made, even the testing
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities where the cannabis is tested
for cannabinoids, they all are required to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
Division badge, which requires a thorough
[SPEAKER_04]: FBI background check, fingerprints,
and an intensive, intensive application
[SPEAKER_04]: process.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't meet the requirements,
you're not going to get a badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about the steps on how to
get this badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you want to work in a
dispensary, this is the first thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're thinking about moving here to
work in legal weed, know this before you
[SPEAKER_07]: move.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one step in here that you'll need
to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to get to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's one of the, I did a lot of,
a lot of research and it was one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite parts to get to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause there's a buttload of people who
moved here that didn't know how to do none
[SPEAKER_07]: of this and don't meet the requirements.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're fucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they're stuck trying to get a job,
doing whatever it was they were doing that
[SPEAKER_07]: they hated so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: They moved across the country to work in
legal weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they're trying to set up a black market
grow to survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're struggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing you got to do,
if you want to get a badge here in the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of Colorado, you have got to find
the application online and they will put
[SPEAKER_04]: the application in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put a link to the application.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read you the website address.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a pen and paper,
or if you want to type this into your web
[SPEAKER_04]: browser quickly, it is colorado.gov slash
Pacific, the word Pacific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.gov slash Pacific slash
enforcement slash medical dash marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: dash occupational dash licensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's colorado.gov slash Pacific slash
enforcement slash medical dash marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: dash occupational licensing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully somebody typed that into
their web browser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully somebody got that, wrote it
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put it in the show notes,
but that's where you need to go to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: application.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you start.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not super hard to find if you just
Google it by name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of things to filter
through though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's confusing on what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does take a minute of reading and kind
of clicking around to find the actual
[SPEAKER_07]: application that you need, because they've
got like four of them posted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're looking for either a key badge
or a support badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk about that in just a couple
of seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I made a note to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So find the application, read and review
the application.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get to a part that says,
this marijuana occupational employee
[SPEAKER_04]: application form is an official document.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you provide false information on your
marijuana license application and or do
[SPEAKER_04]: not disclose all information, the
application asks your license is subject
[SPEAKER_04]: to denial or revocation and you may be
subject to criminal prosecution.
[SPEAKER_04]: The marijuana enforcement division will
conduct a complete background
[SPEAKER_04]: investigation and we'll check all sources
of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are advised that it is better to
disclose all information than face denial,
[SPEAKER_04]: revocation or criminal prosecution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys, they're not bullshitting when
they say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a guy named Tim who has been
waiting months and months for his badge
[SPEAKER_04]: because they are doing a thorough
investigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They found some stuff on his record.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're contacting the state where that
happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking to the actual judge that
resided over my friend's case to find out
[SPEAKER_04]: if he can get his badge or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He writes them letters all the time and
they reply with, we're still
[SPEAKER_04]: investigating, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Disclose your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says, if you need clarification of
any of the following questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: please contact any marijuana enforcement
division office.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means if it's not clear to you,
call them because they do not have.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can tell you exactly what's up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we get into the requirements in a
minute, like we'll get more specific,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like really just tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no fudging this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the requirements.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't meet them straight up,
don't try cause you ain't going to get
[SPEAKER_07]: passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you do, it's a special crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the age of the internet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you did some shit, it's on just
write it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't, they really don't care as long
as it violates the couple of requirements.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they play those straight up and down
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only heard one person who didn't get
their badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they tried to make it sound like a big
conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like, nah, dude, it was that
felony three years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's read the, uh, the
disqualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, uh, these questions go like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever discharged a sentence for a
conviction of a felony pursuant to any
[SPEAKER_04]: state or federal law regarding the
possession, distribution, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation, or use of a controlled
substance, including probation or parole
[SPEAKER_04]: within the last 10 years, even if the
conviction occurred more than 10 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means have you been in jail for
any felonies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what that means?
[SPEAKER_07]: Discharge the sentence?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no drug felonies in 10 years is
what that question's asking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you have to have completed the jail
sentence and any probation or parole at
[SPEAKER_07]: least 10 years before you apply for your
MED badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 10 years ago, you guys, if you had a
drug felony, 10 years, let's be specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says drug felony.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you had to have drugs involved in
your felony and it has to be more than 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that happened, if it was nine years and
365 days, cause it's fucking leap year,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, then you're still not able to qualify.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta wait another day and then apply.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, condition number two, have you
served a sentence, including probation,
[SPEAKER_04]: parole, uh, within the last five years
upon conviction for any felony,
[SPEAKER_04]: even if the conviction occurred more than
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, if you're on probation or
parole five years ago, or within the last
[SPEAKER_04]: five years, you were not allowed to work
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So no drug felonies in 10, no felonies
period in five.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, or probation or parole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the probation or parole for many of
those felonies has to be done at least
[SPEAKER_07]: that many years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this one is neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a licensed physician making
patient recommendations?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a doctor in the industry,
you can't be affiliated with a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're involved with that part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't need a badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand why that rule kind of makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really get where they're going with
the felony rule.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really trying to play it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the state can say with all reassurance
that people who were dealing drugs in the
[SPEAKER_07]: past aren't owning dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: And an easy way to do that is to make sure
that anyone convicted of selling drugs
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't get to be a dispensary owner for
at least the first decade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and yeah, that kind of sucks for
people who got busted back in the day and
[SPEAKER_07]: are now trying to be totally straight up
legal, but that's how Colorado wants to
[SPEAKER_07]: play it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This physician part, they just don't want
you to be a doctor hanging out in a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four says, have you had your
authority to act as primary caregiver,
[SPEAKER_04]: caregiver revoked by the state health
agency?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're, you were somebody's primary
caregiver as not under the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana type of caregiver, but as their
caregiver for somebody who is elderly or
[SPEAKER_04]: disabled, if that's been revoked,
you are not allowed to work in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question is, are you under 21
years of age?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be 21 years old when you
apply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to be 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_04]: 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question says are, are not
questioned, but, uh, let me take a sip
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the next question is,
but I can guess, uh, student loans and
[SPEAKER_07]: child support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are further down the list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the teaser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no, that'll come up in a little bit
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not on this list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thanks for the time to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, are you the spouse?
[SPEAKER_04]: You were under pressure, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you the spouse or child living in the
household?
[SPEAKER_04]: If any person employed by the Colorado
marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if your mom, no working for both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your mom, you can't be a regulator and
a profiteer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mom works at the MED.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have a badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell mom that, uh, she's got to like
disown you or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get your badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her to switch sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her to get on the right team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her to join the force.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's special rules to prevent that from
happening for a chunk of years when you
[SPEAKER_07]: join the MED now, because upon that time,
a bunch of people were going to work for
[SPEAKER_07]: the MED, going through training,
doing a bunch of MED inspections for like
[SPEAKER_07]: three or four months, and then getting a
job at a dispensary for like 10 times the
[SPEAKER_07]: pay, um, to be a compliance officer
because they could put on their resume,
[SPEAKER_07]: MED officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was happening so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: The MED had to pass special, like
non-compete clause rules that,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, they have to sign contracts when they
get their job at the MED now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and then the next one on the last one,
are you a sheriff, deputy sheriff,
[SPEAKER_04]: police officer, or prosecuting officer,
or any officer or employee of the
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana state licensing authority or a
local licensing authority?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the next, the next little,
uh, cops don't get no badges.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next little note here says stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you answered yes to any of the,
of the above questions by Colorado law,
[SPEAKER_04]: you cannot obtain or hold a Colorado
marijuana occupational employee license.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are just straight up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get a license.
[SPEAKER_07]: Period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't try.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll find it with the FBI background
check.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you heard, if you qualify under any
of that shit that we just read,
[SPEAKER_04]: you cannot work in Colorado in the legal
marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to go to California
or Washington or Oregon, or maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan, or who else is legal now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, where can people go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, other legal States, Alaska,
Washington, Oregon, DC sorta go up there
[SPEAKER_07]: with Charlotte and Alaska.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 23 medical marijuana States get
online, look at the laws in each one,
[SPEAKER_07]: see which one ones you can still work or,
or, or, or what you should really do
[SPEAKER_04]: wherever you change the laws in your area,
make the laws better, make it legalized
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis where you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't work in the legal industry,
that doesn't mean you can't lobby on its
[SPEAKER_07]: behalf.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Darrell.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to the podcast, I'm just
going to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, you can, you can do what you can
do for your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can't be a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can't be a manager and you can't
be an owner, but you can always be a
[SPEAKER_04]: lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be an activist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do your part in some way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after it asks, asks you all these
questions, and when you check no to them
[SPEAKER_04]: or yes to them, it makes you sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says, I have thoroughly read and
understand the questions above and
[SPEAKER_04]: understand that I cannot hold a Colorado
marijuana license.
[SPEAKER_04]: If at any time in the future, I can ever
answer yes, answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If at any time in the future, I can ever
answer yes to any of the questions above.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weirdly worded.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's crazy legal talk for if the
answer to this change is like,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you committed a felony nine years ago
and two years past, now that felony
[SPEAKER_07]: conviction and all your shit with it was
over 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you're good to go now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can reapply or apply period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then there's also an arrest disclosure
forum forum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if it says, if since turning age 18,
have you ever been arrested, served
[SPEAKER_04]: criminal summons, charged with or
convicted of any crime regarding the
[SPEAKER_04]: possession distribution or use of a
controlled substance, you must disclose
[SPEAKER_04]: this information to the marijuana
enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you get them all on there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause oops, I forgot that one looks really
fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: They give you plenty of space to list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, check any of the following or
professional licenses you have held.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it asks which licenses you've had.
[SPEAKER_04]: It asks if you've had a liquor license or
a lawyer license or a racing license,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lottery license.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to ask you a lot of crazy
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill all of this out truthfully.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, read the disqualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you qualify, then print out the
application.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fucking print it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 10 pages of paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's several pages here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Read through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you meet the qualifications.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones we read you verbatim are the,
the automatic disqualification ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you start checking yes to some of the
ones we're talking about now, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: automatically mean a no.
[SPEAKER_07]: It means you've got some explaining to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first ones were nos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first ones are automatic nos.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a felony in 10 years, uh,
or a felony in five years, a drug related
[SPEAKER_07]: felony in 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if you're a cop or I don't remember
what the last one was, um, cop or doctor,
[SPEAKER_04]: those all disqualify you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those all DQ you automatically,
but the only two of those that apply to
[SPEAKER_07]: most of the people listening to the show
are the first two.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think any cops listen to the
show?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope there are cops out there listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope there are law enforcement
officers listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the more I think about it,
there's probably a couple number of
[SPEAKER_07]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an event that we did for the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a live show somewhere, though your
place doesn't exist anymore, but we did a
[SPEAKER_04]: live show somewhere and we invited people
to come and I made flyers for the show and
[SPEAKER_04]: I put out flyers for the podcast to come
listen to while people, it was a smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember because I used to sit in a room
with a number of members of law
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcement every Monday night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like when this happened that I was
keenly aware of how many officers were in
[SPEAKER_04]: that room every Monday night, I put out
flyers to listen to the podcast at a
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking event and somehow law enforcement
found the flyers and thought that they
[SPEAKER_04]: were like some sort of tickets to get free
weed at the event or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the next episode, I gave a shout
out to the cops hoping that they were
[SPEAKER_04]: listening because they had the flyers and
it said how to listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a little QR code.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you scan it, it would take you to
iTunes and you could hear the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in law enforcement,
I appreciate you for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're learning the truth about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not evil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't ruin anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not that scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do understand that there are laws that
you have to enforce, but we wish that you
[SPEAKER_04]: would do what you can to change the laws
because I'm sure you see that it's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem where you are officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much respect for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So print the application.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next step here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to keep this show on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's got ADD today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Print the application, complete the
application.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shouldn't be too hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at that point, obtain any court papers
that you need, any arrest disclosure
[SPEAKER_04]: forms, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got tax paper forms that you
need, if you have child support paper
[SPEAKER_04]: forms that you need, print all that,
find those papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you need to make an appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Denver office in Longmont accepts
walk-ins.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Grand Junction, you need to make an
appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Springs, you need to make an
appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The phone number is on the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could have had that for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I failed you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to do a little bit of
this on your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So call and make an appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's way easier to call and make an
appointment in Springs than it is to sit
[SPEAKER_04]: there and wait for like three hours in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I did and it kind of sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You waited all day in Denver?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made my appointment for Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed up about 15 minutes early because
I thought it would take much longer to get
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to judge I-25.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could take you an hour or an hour and a
half to get from here to there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got there about 15 minutes early and
the lady was like, hey, the guy that was
[SPEAKER_04]: scheduled before you didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, fuck yeah,
I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took her, I don't know,
maybe an hour to do the entire process.
[SPEAKER_04]: She fingerprinted me, interviewed me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you're waiting all day in
Denver is because that's how long it
[SPEAKER_07]: takes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of other people just
showed up every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just relax when they're fingerprinting
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, if you've got warrants
or something, if you're wanted in the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of Colorado and you're in the MED
office, getting your shit done,
[SPEAKER_04]: they run your ID.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're wanted, they come and
fucking arrest you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really can't emphasize,
like read the questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the answer's yes to the first four,
or you've got like active warrants out
[SPEAKER_07]: now, don't apply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't apply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will come and arrest you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're getting fingerprinted and they
run your shit and you're wanted by the
[SPEAKER_04]: FBI, there's a sign on the door that says
unmarked or plain clothes security officer
[SPEAKER_04]: on premises at all times.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will come and arrest you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent three and a half hours trying to
find the dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I found both of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're not playing around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Read the questions, answer them honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the secondary questions, like child
support and student loans, if you've got
[SPEAKER_07]: any of those, you know, any of those
questions apply to you, you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: need to contact that institution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I had to contact everybody I've got
student loans with and get a paper that
[SPEAKER_07]: says my student loans are in good
standing, which means if you've been
[SPEAKER_07]: ducking that shit for a decade,
you need to stand up, take the punch,
[SPEAKER_07]: set up a payment plan, start making
payments.
[SPEAKER_07]: You only need to make one payment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with child support.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your child support is fucked up,
I was cool cause mine's legit,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if your child support is fucked up,
they will make you get a paper from your
[SPEAKER_04]: caseworker that says that you're paying
and that you're doing what you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had felonies 17 years ago or over
the deadline and you're good to go,
[SPEAKER_07]: you need paperwork from the court that
adjudicated your felony in the original
[SPEAKER_07]: jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to fucking contact the court that
tried and sensed you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And get the paperwork from them that says
you completed successfully and on what
[SPEAKER_07]: date you completed for every fucking
felony.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can be a real pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got, I mean, I've talked to people
in Denver while I was waiting that had to
[SPEAKER_07]: go to like seven different courthouses to
pick up stuff that they got between 20 or
[SPEAKER_07]: like 18 and 20.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they've been perfect for a
decade, but they had still had to spend
[SPEAKER_07]: four days driving between courthouses,
getting paperwork so that they could then
[SPEAKER_07]: apply to work in the legal marijuana
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like have your shit together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some, for some of you, that's going to
be a lot of paperwork gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have it together,
the lady at the MED office or the man,
[SPEAKER_04]: the person that helped me was a lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always think it's a lady,
but the person that helps you at the MED
[SPEAKER_04]: office, they will give you a list of
everything that you need after you fail
[SPEAKER_04]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first step of the process when
you get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's your turn as they go through your
shit piece by piece and make sure you have
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I got done, it was very clearly
like you have everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your first try.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: High five.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was well-prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew plenty of people that have badges.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we, neither of us had an issue,
but we've all talked to countless people
[SPEAKER_07]: that have no idea what this process looks
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: They even moved to Colorado, moved across
the country unprepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so knowing this and doing it right is
sort of essential folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got 44 felonies, you're probably
not going to get a badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been thinking about him this whole
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our buddy, 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's ever known why we call him 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the only hint we're going to
give you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next step is show up and complete the
damn interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an MED interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter what you wear or
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comb your hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do that, if you got dreadlocks,
flatten them down because they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: make you take off your hat.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to make you take your hat
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're going to wear the picture
they take around your neck for the next
[SPEAKER_07]: two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, I'm 6'5".
[SPEAKER_04]: And that picture place, they have like a
little, like a swatch on the floor or on
[SPEAKER_04]: the wall of material where you're supposed
to stand in front of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 5'10", like where most people
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to do a squat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to smile as I'm doing
squats.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the squat, but not real far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you show up for the place,
when you show up for the interview,
[SPEAKER_04]: bring the completed application,
have that shit filled out before you get
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring your ID, bring your court papers and
disclosure forms.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got any of those to bring with
you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring proof of residency.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have, if you're new to
Colorado and your ID, if you do have an
[SPEAKER_04]: out of state ID, that's what the fuck I'm
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your ID is from out of state,
bring proof of residency.
[SPEAKER_04]: That you do live in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring a phone bill, bring a fucking cable
bill, bring the light bill, bring whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: you got.
[SPEAKER_07]: This goes back to column and they'll tell
you exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the time to bring up my ID
says I'm from Texas or Tennessee or
[SPEAKER_07]: wherever the fuck, like bring it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll tell you exactly what you need
supporting paperwork wise.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got felonies, they'll tell you
what to, what to ask the courts for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with your child support stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: They told me exactly what you had to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all on the application when you look
at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're happy to answer these
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not take cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring a money order or bring a check.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to get your key badge,
and this is where we'll talk about this
[SPEAKER_04]: part.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to get your key badge,
it's going to cost you $300.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want your support badge,
it is $150.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike looked at me, is that wrong,
dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I just looked at the website.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the prices were right, but I think
Denver takes cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like 85%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent that to somebody else that was
helping me with this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, they will not accept cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the website says bring check or money
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm pretty sure they quit accepting
cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew that only one office did,
and I could have sworn it was Denver,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I might've taken a check.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked at a place that had a lot of cash
flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we had a lot of cash in the end of
the register at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked at several places and just
imagine how many applications they handle
[SPEAKER_04]: a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: $150 a badge, minimum time, 16,000
employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Divide it by 365 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't want that much money in a
box in the MED office anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like over a fucking couple of days,
that box is going to be full of cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand they probably just be
prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys take a check or take a money
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stop it somewhere that sells a money
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking Walmart sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have money orders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most Walgreens will sell you a
money order.
[SPEAKER_07]: Several 7-elevens will do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to the post office, get yourself a
money order, go to the MED place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's talk about the difference
between a key badge and a support badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: There always has to be a support badge on
premises.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can be in my grow without a support
badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: There either has to be a red badge,
which is the owner badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to own the place to get that one
or a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have a key badge,
if there's not a key badge on premises,
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody else can be in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the support badges can be in the
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I find it advantageous to go ahead and
get that key badge because then you're
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of more qualified to do more shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've already got more ability to take on
more responsibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made sure to get the key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like getting your key badge
helped you advance in your position at the
[SPEAKER_04]: spot?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those rules are more heavily
enforced on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe I'm just, no, I'm the only
support badge several nights a week at
[SPEAKER_07]: work.
[SPEAKER_07]: My only key badge, that might be why I got
promoted.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my promotions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes you more promotable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a support badge, you can be like a
budtender.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be a joint roller.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the gardens, you can- Support badge is
the starter badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've only got 150 to spend on a badge
and you know you're going to be a trimmer
[SPEAKER_07]: for the first year- Or a budtender.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a budtender, you can go ahead and get
the support.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not saying don't, but the key badge
definitely gives you more opportunities in
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're one of those people that's
moving to Colorado with a degree in
[SPEAKER_07]: biochemistry, you might want to go ahead
and get the support badge or the key
[SPEAKER_07]: badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm mixing those two in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to figure, you confused me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The key badge is the more important one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking for the distinguishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says something about on the
application.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to have keys and be in
charge of employees and have access to
[SPEAKER_04]: limited access areas, you should go ahead
and get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I recommend, of course, get the key
badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have the money for it,
get yourself a support badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're an ambitious person and you feel
like you want to move up, if you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to manage that bitch, go ahead and get a
key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to work with the grow team,
if you're real enthusiastic and you can
[SPEAKER_04]: show that you can do it, get yourself a
key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to see you move up in the
industry super quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew I wasn't going to be on the bottom
rung for long.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I fully got that one on purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I know a lot of other people that did
that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a couple of people who got the
support and have been kind of passed over
[SPEAKER_07]: several times because they can't meet some
of those requirements that you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: have the key for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to have a key badge on premises at all
times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to be pretty much in the same room
with the support badges and even leave
[SPEAKER_04]: them in another room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to be like the cultivation
manager, get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to be a trim team leader,
get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe even if you want to be lead
budtender, you might need a key badge
[SPEAKER_04]: because you'll be carrying product back to
the storage room, which requires a key
[SPEAKER_04]: badge to get into, or at least it should.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get your badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decide which badge you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next step here, you guys, once you've
got your badge, wait for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking smile for your picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look good in the picture, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next step.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to look like a dumb ass and
then hang that picture around your neck
[SPEAKER_07]: for the next two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wear that bright green Colorado medical
marijuana enforcement division lanyard
[SPEAKER_04]: with your cheesy ass picture on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so funny walking into places.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have your original lanyard?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the original green one, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to be OG, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you've got that picture with your
cheesy ass grin on it, you got a badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next step is to get a job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get the badge, now you can apply
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think about what you're good at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you good at budtending?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you good at trimming?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, we keep saying budtending and
trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ways into this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to be a master grower,
most places have a master grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to start trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to show them that you
know about plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day the master grower is going to go,
fuck, I need help transplanting plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to go, I'm good at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's going to go, well, come show me
what you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can follow directions and do it
the way that he wants it done and also
[SPEAKER_04]: contribute skill, knowledge, and care to
the job, you may end up being assistant
[SPEAKER_04]: grower one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may let you come help me pull leaves in
the garden one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll work your way up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day when I'm or not me,
I don't want to say about the master
[SPEAKER_04]: grower at whatever facility you work at
one day when he's sick or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's got the shits and can't come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you get to water the plants or
whatever and you get to learn how to
[SPEAKER_04]: become a master grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to work your way up one way
or another.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff and I were both budtenders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's where you start.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people start off as trimmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where you start.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can be almost anything in the
marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we literally need every profession.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have played budtender manager.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did the hiring and firing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still doing the growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do some transportation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do a bunch of, do all of the, yeah,
I used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've helped with design at different
points.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've designed a couple of facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've designed rooms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a lot of options available.
[SPEAKER_07]: I talk to people every day that aren't
prepared for that idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, well, I've been in marketing
for like 10 years and it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you ready to trim some weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like do you think you could learn
everything in this room and what their
[SPEAKER_07]: different applications are for different
patients and sell it accurately and
[SPEAKER_07]: well-informed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, can you pull that off?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause if you can't do that or be cool with
trimming a shill of weed, like you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to have a really hard time looking
for dispensary that's actively looking for
[SPEAKER_07]: a marketing dude who's never worked in
legal weed before and doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_07]: know the community, the culture,
the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: The clients, like there's a lot you need
to know and you learn that when you start
[SPEAKER_07]: as a butt tender or a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole etiquette.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole world to be involved in.
[SPEAKER_07]: A buddy of mine started as a trimmer and
like six weeks later, he was running a
[SPEAKER_07]: trim crew for like seven different
dispensaries and they just cycled between
[SPEAKER_07]: them as they harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Linus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Linus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like he had, he struggled for a while,
find a dispensary that would even take him
[SPEAKER_07]: on as a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when he finally found one,
he made sure to put it in his all and now
[SPEAKER_07]: he's running a big ass crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: A big crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what he's doing on Facebook and he's
killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: His crew is killing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're killing it right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we moved up quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be motivated if you want to come here and
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: This industry is growing so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're growing so rapidly and there are so
many people coming from around the world
[SPEAKER_04]: to be in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 50 people trying to take your
job in this industry every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green and healthy wellness is a small shop
with a small location.
[SPEAKER_04]: We aren't very well known yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of new.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a large following.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what I'm trying to say with
a whole bunch of words.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a huge following,
but we get probably five to 10
[SPEAKER_04]: applications every single day of people
that want to be growers, trimmers,
[SPEAKER_04]: bud tenders, whatever they can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I will clean the toilets as
long as you give me a job in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see some crazy, I see a lot of people
coming in that are doing it right,
[SPEAKER_07]: that are ready to work, that know the
industry and know how to sell their place
[SPEAKER_07]: in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of it comes down to knowing how
to pitch your previous work experience
[SPEAKER_07]: because I sold weed from my living room
for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like shit on a resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of that- You did an episode
before that covered some of the resumes
[SPEAKER_07]: you got in the grow and how ridiculous
some of them could get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put together a real resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't know what that is,
Google it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be prepared because there's a lot of
people got in for the jobs that are
[SPEAKER_07]: available.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even with this, how fast we're expanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to stand out at all,
you got to do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's talk about some of the problems
that come with getting a job working in
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one most obvious problem to me
is banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you worked at a dispensary or as a
grower, and I can't speak for every shop
[SPEAKER_04]: or every grow, and this is something that
I probably shouldn't say too much about,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is the damn truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: When payday comes, you get an envelope
stuffed with cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is done in cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a pay stub and taxes are taken out
and that you get a pay stub showing-
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else is the same, but instead
of a check at the bottom or better yet,
[SPEAKER_07]: a voided check that tells you about the
direct deposit you just got, you get a
[SPEAKER_07]: check stub folded up with a bunch of 20s
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of 20s in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awkward as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to carry all these damn 20s in
your backpack or somehow to the car and
[SPEAKER_04]: then home.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not just payroll.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everything, like state taxes,
federal taxes, electric bills,
[SPEAKER_07]: rent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you get home, you got to figure
out a way to convert all that cash into
[SPEAKER_04]: some way to pay your rent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is the obvious problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, employees can usually get bank
accounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's smaller banks.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the businesses that really can't get
accounts, but you've still got to transfer
[SPEAKER_07]: cash to bank.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that cash came from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes it stinks like weed,
which can trigger your account to get
[SPEAKER_07]: closed if your weed stinks too much or if
your money stinks too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a mutual friend whose account was
just closed because their cash deposit
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled way too much like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to that person.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know you're safe, y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one of the problems, we've talked
about this a little bit on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another problem that can happen if you
work in the cannabis industry is you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get pulled over and you're going
to smell like a pound of fucking weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: the cops are going to harass you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a badge, a lot of times they
expect you to be a model citizen because
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got the badge and you know the
rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got to be a little more careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or back to putting your vest foot forward
like, don't stink like weed with your
[SPEAKER_07]: badge on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as soon as they see that fucker or
even the green lanyard that goes with it,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're automatically going to be
thinking, is this person high right now
[SPEAKER_07]: behind the wheel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have a DUI at rest?
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't be that person.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, renting is hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a house is hard when you're place
of employment is green and healthy
[SPEAKER_04]: wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a stigma involved that a lot of
people don't realize.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a friend leaving the industry
right now and they were talking to me just
[SPEAKER_07]: this afternoon that they're applying for
jobs that aren't in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's real hesitant because he hasn't
faced the company, the drug tests in a
[SPEAKER_07]: decade.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a bud tender and a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And passionate about cannabis,
really enjoys that aspect of his life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at minimum, he's going to have to give
it up until he can pee clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wasn't necessarily expecting to
leave the industry this abruptly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's not prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so at best, his ass is going to be out
of work for a while while he looks for
[SPEAKER_07]: either jobs that don't test or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's extra hesitant because as soon as
they're like, well, what'd you just stop
[SPEAKER_07]: doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, well, I've worked in the
legal marijuana industry for three years
[SPEAKER_07]: and now I'm trying to get a job at a bank
or wherever the hell else, the mall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be judgmental for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if they don't typically drug test,
or there's a lot of companies,
[SPEAKER_07]: I've worked for a bunch of them back in
the day, they just threatened to drug
[SPEAKER_07]: test.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only drug test they do is whether
or not you show up to get your cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't actually afford to pay like the
75 bucks or whatever to test you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even those companies are more likely to
have to test somebody who's coming out of
[SPEAKER_07]: the legal weed industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just got that stigma attached to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So renting, banking, renting cars,
getting loans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to get to that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Renting a car is kind of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was turned down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bought a new car.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, woo hoo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my new car.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also shout out to Mario Orcholetta for
the sweet hookup on the new car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out for not having to fix your old
car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did that also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got two cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a winter car and a summer car now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was declined.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting stacks of envelopes in
the mail from credit companies that
[SPEAKER_04]: declined my credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you look at why it says
insufficient employment, and I make a shit
[SPEAKER_04]: ton of money, not to brag about my money,
but I make plenty of fucking money for the
[SPEAKER_04]: car that I bought.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just didn't like it that I worked
at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would call me while I was waiting in
the Ford dealership to buy my car.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would call and they'd be like,
hey, we've just got one question about
[SPEAKER_04]: your employment.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this G-A-H-W you work at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I just write down G-A-H-W,
turn to avoid questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, it stands for green and
healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh, are you a weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd be like, well, yeah, bitch,
why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we can't, we sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't, we can't give you credit today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just hang up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not all companies, but it's several.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the companies that don't
apply to this, but like there's a stigma
[SPEAKER_07]: that you're going to take on and you kind
of have to be ready to bear that cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just out in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like plenty of you got family that's like,
oh, fucking cousin Ricky working at the
[SPEAKER_07]: weed store.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should mention all the drug testing
talk, the dispensary won drug testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, but don't show up high
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too many fucking rules to come
toasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can't tell your high, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can tell your high, you're in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be that high asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get us all in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the obvious problems, the obvious
problems with working in the industry are
[SPEAKER_04]: banking, credit, getting a car,
getting a loan, that kind of shit is hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friend, Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked her for guidance on this because
she was a manager at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said the first thing she spattered off
with the passion was fucking sexism in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: She called it a boys club and said that
this is ran by guys and she's a woman and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard to be taken fucking seriously by
all the men in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ladies, when you come to Colorado,
your chances of getting a job are nearly
[SPEAKER_04]: tripled of what a guy with the same
qualifications are going to have,
[SPEAKER_04]: the chances of that same dude are going to
have of getting employment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that sounds rude to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't care what you'd look like if
you're a trimmer for the most part,
[SPEAKER_07]: but if you're a bud tender, automatically
hot females go to the top of the stack and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's kind of true in any industry,
but it's really true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super true in the cannabis industry,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to get hired first.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, everybody's going to
look at your titties all fucking day long
[SPEAKER_04]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are used to growing weed in our
basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're used to being a bunch of bros.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a boys club.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should know this by now, but the grow
environment, the weed business
[SPEAKER_04]: environment, sometimes people forget and
it gets a little bit sexist a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rules that apply to every other
industry, we're under so many weed
[SPEAKER_07]: specific rules that in a lot of ways the
ball gets dropped with some of the others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So slap us, remind us, be like,
boys, there are women in the room,
[SPEAKER_04]: behave yourselves, and a guy like myself
will check myself after one or two of
[SPEAKER_04]: those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe me, I don't say some shit when
damsels around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out damsel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned to respect the ladies a
little bit better because I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: reminded.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the ladies that have
taught us that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some sexism in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be prepared for that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another huge problem, you cannot consume
on site.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to consume cannabis while
you're working at a medical marijuana or
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational marijuana grow facility,
processing facility, anything like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you cannot do it anywhere near the
building.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care where you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cameras cannot see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: People that are leaving the dispensary
should not see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Consume your medicine somewhere far away,
safely, legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that I would mention is a pain
in the ass in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may think I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are going to be like,
wah, but there is so much tedious
[SPEAKER_07]: regulation and so much pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: They went way overboard with the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watch people every day grind up scraps
of marijuana stems, shit that you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_07]: even consider feeling bad about if you
threw away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to grind it with coffee and
shredded paper to make it
[SPEAKER_07]: indistinguishable and unusable.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you translate that to a major grow,
the amount of how you throw out the trash
[SPEAKER_07]: becomes a majorly complicated process.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're forced to do, I run a big grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are harvesting 85 lights worth of
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make trash lasagna, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do, I will start a trash can where
the trimmers are and I'll put,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll harvest a plant and I will put that
pot of dirt in the bottom of the can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's a little bit of dirt in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then as we trim, the leaves and a little
bit of sticks will go in and then I'll go
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest another plant or maybe we've got
old pots stacked up and I'll pour some of
[SPEAKER_04]: that dirt in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes dirt, leaves, dirt, leaves,
and then I'll sweep up the floor and shit
[SPEAKER_04]: and put the sweepings in there,
but you got to mix up that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed shouldn't be recognizable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it has to go into a locked trash can,
which is also behind a gate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have had our fucking trash broken
into, torn out of the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tear the bags open and they destroy
all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to go fucking sweep it up and put
the trash back in the goddamn trash can in
[SPEAKER_04]: the morning when I get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a lot of regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regulations are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's got to be weighed a million
times and there are checks on things also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little bit stressful on all the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the pressure is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have to happen at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have to be done quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't wait for some shit in a big grow
and you're on camera from 9,000 different
[SPEAKER_04]: angles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't ever think you're going to get
away with anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: The being on camera on every square inch
takes some adjusting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watch it all day at work.
[SPEAKER_07]: People forget they're on camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I point it out to customers and I'm
like, we're on camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see and hear everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hear everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to get us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop fucking asking how to take weed to
Texas.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't answer you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop asking how many pieces of edibles you
should eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking one in way two hours,
bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you twice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets stressful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the rules always fucking change.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get emails once a week with new rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: New rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a special company that makes law
books and they're on their third marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: book now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to buy the original book and then
the two addendum books.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's most of what I've got that's
stressful.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing that Mike can testify to is
he's a bud tinder mostly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the consumer is so educated that they
expect a bud and foe educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think they know what the fuck they're
talking about that they expect a bud
tinder.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear the phrase a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hear indigo even more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good and a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm blessed to be in the medical
side of things now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get a lot of that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I see kind of a more
touristy side of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, they just haven't had the
culture in the community out loud and
[SPEAKER_07]: proud like we have here in Colorado,
like down in Texas and in Arkansas for as
[SPEAKER_07]: long.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like you can really tell who's been in
the community actively and who hasn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's been like a marijuana consumer in
the total shadows like most of their
[SPEAKER_07]: friends don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: They definitely wouldn't talk about it in
public or on the news or on the radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've never heard anyone say sativa
before or indigo.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just never happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've only ever read it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just thinking about that kind of
boggles my mind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I try to pity them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I hear it for like the 14th time
on a Saturday, it makes me want to fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: cock bunch somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I saw the same thing in the wine
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it exists other places.
[SPEAKER_07]: People think they know a lot and they act
snotty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the dispensary where the budtender
knows fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes you feel stupid and doesn't
realize that I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I love it when they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in a shop the other day in Denver
and I heard wrong information.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a strain labeled wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I listened to the budtender go on for
like four minutes about how it was in
[SPEAKER_07]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's a really popular sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just sitting there shaking my head
as the customer gobbles it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, dude, look at the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I can tell that's a fucking sativa
from over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just by the way the buds are growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid professional weed smokers.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, thanks for coming to the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, that's all we've got for how to
get your badge here in the state of
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how to get your badge and some of
the things that come along with that
[SPEAKER_07]: particular key to awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out once again to that one mountain
girl and also huge shout out to Jessica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both were huge contributors to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also shout out to the CD, the Colorado
Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_04]: Environment website for all the
information they gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody who wished me a happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was on Facebook, if it was on
Instagram, if it was on Twitter,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it was here face to face, if it was
through text message.
[SPEAKER_04]: However it was, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole week has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still raging.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been several days since my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually the fourth now and my
birthday was on the first and I have
[SPEAKER_04]: finally eaten all of the food and snacks
that I was given on my birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I however have not consumed all of the
Chipotle gift cards that I was given.
Dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody gave me a Chipotle gift card.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got that on deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that'll be my after work treat
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just went to check my phone to see if
Chipotle was still possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of late for Chipotle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big thanks to everybody that hooked me
up for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you fed me, if you took me out,
if you dabbed me out, if you gave me some
[SPEAKER_04]: solventless hash that I pressed into one
giant fucking dab, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you dabbed me out with Spherex,
big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also big shout out to my friends at the
Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dropped into the Canna Canyon yesterday
and hung out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in there dabbed me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in there was happy to see me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're ever in Colorado Springs and you
need a place to stop and kill a few
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes, you want to smoke down,
I always recommend the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Colorado Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you Google the Canna Canyon in Colorado
Springs, you will get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell Camille that Rasta Jeff sent you,
that you listen to the Grow from the Heart
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: She will treat you like royalty.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think I've got for you this
week, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have more episodes planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do an episode with a bunch of
lovely ladies and we'll talk about women
[SPEAKER_04]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it'll be in the future anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to talk too much about
what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My little notebook is over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, I want to thank you for hanging out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to leave the little guy at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you didn't miss him too much while
you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let you get back to him real
soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was about that time, but it's
good to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard an episode a little while back,
someone mentioned missing me on the shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Life got crazy, but this is still
important to me and I want to be here as
[SPEAKER_07]: often as I can, but that's not as often as
I would like right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for my absence and I hope you
like me on the show lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our buddy Mike O was his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was Mike O.
[SPEAKER_07]: He sent a couple of emails, which I like.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like repeated updates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he was a little pissed off that you
hadn't been here for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was kind of upset with the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Life exploded and the show had to take a
back burner for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a minute there, it was a big part of
my extracurricular activities and that
[SPEAKER_07]: time got filled big time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't blame you at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kid is the most important thing in
your world as it should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but yeah, the show is still a
priority, so we're recording real late at
[SPEAKER_07]: night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we said, Chipotle, be fucking close.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we're scratching it out,
but I wanted to be part of the show,
[SPEAKER_07]: getting a badge is like, I've seen so many
people fucked because they didn't know
[SPEAKER_07]: this information before they made a big
leap and I really wanted to be a part of
[SPEAKER_07]: the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, sorry for the ramblings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you got the information you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because knowing is half the battle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowing is fucking half the battle,
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I want to thank everybody for
listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again to Mike for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be back in seven days with another
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what I'm going to put out for
you in seven days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a lot of stuff written down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you tune in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you check out the show on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have any sponsors on this
episode.

you've got a product you'd like me to
[SPEAKER_04]: review, send me an email.

[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big shout out to a
product called Spherex.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to dab this new Earl called
Spherex last night at the Cana Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only took one dab of it so far.

[SPEAKER_04]: So check that product out if you're in
Colorado.
