[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Podcast Internet World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 847 of the Grow From Your
Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's episode, we're going to talk
about selecting male plants for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump into that, I do want to
give you a quick heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will not be a podcast episode next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a little short vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take the week off of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back in two weeks with fresh new
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into the main portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website, of course, is iregenetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top of that website, there's a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab and send me a
good grow question, if I read your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question here on the podcast, I will send
you a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's question, of course, was about
selecting male plants for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question came from our new friend
Bearclaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bearclaw, big shout out, my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your inbox and check
your spam folder because you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question from Bearclaw goes a
little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, what steps do you
take to identify a breeder male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you compare against multiple males of
the same strain or just save a
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly hardy male when you do find
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does spark a lot of conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, I feel like I'm fairly good at
selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of confidence in selecting
male plants and breeding pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that shows in my selection of King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon was my Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a golden goat female pollinated by a
daybreaker male that made Arise plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male plant in that batch that
was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his own name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is called King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do some research on King Solomon
if you'd like to know more about why I
[SPEAKER_00]: named him that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, King Solomon has been used in
hundreds of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made probably a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to realistically say a hundred
different crosses with King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably 95 of them were complete
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything King Solomon touched turned to
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an awesome breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another good example of my male
selection is the Jack the Ripper male that
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected from the seeds from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Jack the Ripper male made more
amazing progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blueberry Butcher, the Jack Tripper,
of course, all the Jack the Ripper F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I did a very good job at
selecting that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great male that I do use,
of course, is the BC Lemon Skunk male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male is super vigorous, super hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts amazing aromas and flavors into
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a little bit of time to
flower in some crosses, but I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody does, but I do enjoy a
longer flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another good male that I have
selected?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the male Chocolope that I selected to
make the Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another amazing male plant that
made a lot of great progeny, which most of
[SPEAKER_00]: those have not been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe, I'll put out more of
those Chocolope crosses in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are many, if not all,
of the male plants which I have selected
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've used in my breeding projects
that show that I do have a pretty good eye
[SPEAKER_00]: for selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about how I
choose these plants for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things we could talk
about, a lot of ways to open this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to talk about is
having a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every good breeding project needs a goal
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your male plant is going to be half of
your outcome, so have an idea of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to create because your male is going
to contribute to half of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your progeny will have half of the
attributes that your male plant has got,
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're going to have attributes from
those female plants which we breed it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but have a goal in mind is going to be my
first thing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding, have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, you may just stumble
across a stellar male plant that just
[SPEAKER_00]: talks to you and you don't have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always works, but if you really want
to start a solid breeding project,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend learning about Mendel charts,
allele charts, and doing things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's actually focus in on selecting
these male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hypothetically say that we acquired
a 10-pack of regular male female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to germinate those 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most likely, we're going to find five
males and five females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers could be skewed a little bit,
but for this scenario, for this selection
[SPEAKER_00]: process, we got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got five beautiful males, five
beautiful females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put the female plants away
for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conversation, we're going to focus on
selecting this male plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, amongst these five male plants,
you said something at the beginning here
[SPEAKER_00]: that got my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, save a particularly hardy male
when you find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that set off a buzzer in my head
because I usually do not choose the most
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy male in a selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say I've got these five male
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, maybe the first two to show
me that it's male, is not my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not the plants I want to choose
for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that plant is probably going
to get real tall and real stretchy and be
[SPEAKER_00]: real fibrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be an amazing hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to make fibers, ropes,
textiles, something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant would be beautiful,
but that's not what I'm breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sticky, icky buds with high
potency, a lot of tricotin, beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, flavors, and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want that hemp kind of plant,
that long, stretchy, superstructurey,
[SPEAKER_00]: branchy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding for a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other idea about this plant is those
first two plants to show that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: male, they're a little bit too male
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I can describe that is,
think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine Brock Lesnar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you already know who Brock Lesnar
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may not have any clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock Lesnar was a UFC fighter,
was also a professional wrestler.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also a powerlifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a gigantic man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big dude, and I think Brock Lesnar
is fucking gigantic compared to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to be, I didn't research this,
but he's got to be fucking 6'5",
[SPEAKER_00]: 260, something like that, maybe 280.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's built like a brick shithouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's nothing but muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a solid muscular dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a wrestler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of testosterone going on in his
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, beefy fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would compare those first two
males to show that they're male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are male in my batch of seeds,
which there's nothing wrong with being a
[SPEAKER_00]: big, beefy, muscular fucking masculine
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when I do my breeding project,
I don't want all of my offspring to look
[SPEAKER_00]: just like my starting male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have the opportunity for the
female plants to express themselves in my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the whole purpose of this idea
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to recreate that male plant,
I would just recreate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to point out is
recently I saw a picture of Brock Lesnar's
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter, and it totally supported this
theory that I have had for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew this until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock Lesnar's daughter looks just fucking
like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a big lifter as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's shaped just like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the same face, same facial expression,
same hairline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poor girl looks just like Brock
Lesnar, which sort of supports my idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that his genes totally dominated that
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know what the mom looks
like, but I know that that daughter looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just like Brock Lesnar, and I feel like if
you take that first male to show that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a male, you're going to get Brock Lesnar
plants out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get to see their
feminine qualities, their beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to get reproductions of
that male, and it's also, in my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a lot of branchy, stocky,
hempy type of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of these five male plants we've got
from seed, I usually do not select the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two or the last one to show me that
it's male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's that third or fourth one is
my selection when I'm choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my precursor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that first one, that second
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll let it pass if they're not
showing me that they are way too cocky,
[SPEAKER_00]: too dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not dragging their fucking
knuckles on the floor, not drooling,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe perhaps I'll let those slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is kind of a rule of thumb,
like my first little screener of when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see, did this male pop out right
away and become way too vigorous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that male plant that tries to get
real, real tall and grow way above
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, that plant's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't breed with that one, because guess
what it's going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to breed a bunch of me,
tall, and fucking skinny and lanky,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't need that in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first step of advice, the first step
was to have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have something in mind which you want to
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second step of advice is out of those
five male plants, out of that pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, don't pick numbers one and two to
show you that they're a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on three and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably your good candidates
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more about
visual traits that I do see in these male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to help us identify if they are
good breeding candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they've got to fit the criteria
for your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make tall, slender plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make short, squatty plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make plants with big,
fat, wide leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make plants with narrow,
skinny leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make plants that give you a
crazy head buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make plants that make you
chill out and want to take a nap?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all going to have to do with your
selection, so keep all of that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visually, things that we can see are
basic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this male plant sturdy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it stout?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it able to hold itself up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a female plant with that stout,
a structure that had buds on it and big
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers on it, would that be a good shape
and a good frame to support a nice amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of weight and flowers on that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this male plant wispy, falling over,
not able to support itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets big into flower, does the top
start tipping over, do the bottom start
[SPEAKER_00]: flopping everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the shape, the frame,
and the structure of this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is going to play heavily into
your progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of the shape and structure will show
up in the children, so think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about leaf size and shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us a lot of details about how
long it will take to flower, about what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of buzz to expect from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the leaf size and shape,
because the structure, the leaf size and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, that's all going to play into the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about vigor?
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly does this plant grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: When he sprouted the seed, how quickly did
it take off?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take for that first set of
true leaves to come?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this plant tolerate any abuse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you give it a drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you overwater it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it get spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it resistant to pathogens and pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things to think about when
looking for a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visually, we can see leaf size and
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see structure of the plant overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see sturdiness of the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can also see if there is any
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this plant putting out any cool colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant displays cool colors,
you just might get some colors passed down
[SPEAKER_00]: into your progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some purple, some dark color,
colored offspring if you've got some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: colored plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your male plant put out trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely love to breed with the male
plant that puts out trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that translates into more
trichomes in the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about branching style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants like to go up and then they
branch out real wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants like to go kind of up and then
they just put a lot of equilateral
[SPEAKER_00]: branches off to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some branch off almost sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some branch off almost straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a clone off this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How easily does it clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that will play into your progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how long does it take to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to flower this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flower my male plants before I
use them for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flower that plant out and see how
long it takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take for that plant to
start showing me flower clusters?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long until I get pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much pollen does this plant put out?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it only puts out a little bit of
pollen, it might not be worth breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a dumper with pollen, we're going
to love that if all the other traits line
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell that stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get into flower a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have good aromas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those aromas and flavors will
translate to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I say a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a breeder male that smells like a
bar trash can and hot vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds weird, but that always
translates to good offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about flowering time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this briefly a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you initiate flower, on this male
plant, how long does it take to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a male plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take to say I'm going to
really start banging out male flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take to start dropping
pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it continue to drop pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big does that big male cluster get
when you get laid into flower with this
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I recommend flowering your male
plants seven, eight, nine, maybe 10 weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what this bad bitch does.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it herms on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it shows you any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it can handle any stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it does weird shit at week nine
because sometimes you'll notice things
[SPEAKER_00]: late in flower that you did not notice
early on and you may be glad you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: select that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen time and amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it put out enough pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed for commercial purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a plant that only puts out
sprinkles of dust, that old dude doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get to party in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a young dude that's ready to throw
out a big amount of pollen so I can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: big amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about flower size and shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for a male plant with a nice big
fat top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me that guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My offspring is going to make a big fat
top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it shaped well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like when the top cola is not just long
and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to get kind of bulky and kind of
fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the shape really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about trichomes a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other notable characteristics do you
see in this male plant that stand out to
[SPEAKER_00]: you because all of those traits are going
to pass along into your offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look for a male plant from seed that
doesn't flower too quickly, isn't too
[SPEAKER_00]: eager to show me that it's a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a male plant with a nice structure
and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That all depends on what my goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that can support itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that can tolerate popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of super cropping if you
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pop and twist the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a little bit of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that stuff stress out the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does my basic function in the grow room
stress out that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does, I don't want to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I specifically think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I breeding these seeds for me to play
with to make more new shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I breeding these for the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may choose different males if I'm
breeding it for my personal use or if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding it as something to put out to the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need something more easy to grow,
more reliable for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can breed the challenging 16 week shit,
real weirdos, finicky feeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I make a decision in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking at them visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the leaf size, the leaf
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a smooth smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give them a little bit of a
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to overwater them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see if they clone well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the use of having this plant if I
cannot clone it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely take a couple of clones
and I'll take one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use rapid rooters in a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to use an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll take a clone in both and see
which one loves it and which one doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they both love it, we're in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to definitely use this plant
in a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can I cover for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down noticeable characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What stands out to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you walk by a plant,
you just go, oh, that plant right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I call this my breeder
intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say learn Mendel charts,
learn alial charts, read about Robert
[SPEAKER_00]: Connell Clark's botany books, learn about
all of the breeding books from Greg Green,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn every breeding book, learn about
what Gregor Mendel was up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it all comes down to breeding,
forget all of that and breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: intuition, grow from your heart and breed
with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walk through a commercial facility
or sometimes I'll be at a friend's grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll see a plant and I'll go,
bro, that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like when you're at a concert or
at the club or sometimes even at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking grocery store or quite often at
Target, settle down ladies at Target,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll fall in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be walking through and you'd be
like, damn, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how breeding with plants works
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with a lot of plants in
commercial facilities that I've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: through the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll see this plant and I'll say
something about this plant is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll grow it a bunch of times
and you'll get to experience a drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering, overfeeding, underfeeding,
perhaps a spider might attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a commercial grow, I get to see how
all these plants react to all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they react right,
that's when I go ahead and get myself a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut, enter that into my garden and we
start breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a lot of beautiful things in
other gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a beautiful cut of the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked too much about this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a cut of the cream in a local
friend's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend that I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to live right down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a beautiful cut of the cream in
his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not want his name said on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably listening with your wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out wife also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, my friends found a beautiful
phenotype of the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I plan to reverse that and make
feminized seeds with that in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that plant was just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit every note.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw it in veg, I was like,
that thing's going to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in flower, I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, damn, this bitch is a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on in flower, it kind of lost some
of the aroma, but the veg shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and time was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it went into flower, the flowering
time was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's set, bud set beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't over leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had enough leaf to keep the plant
alive, but it was easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it got more into flower, the buds got
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got beautiful colors to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got real thick layers of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a beautiful female plant that
just spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've chosen that to be one of my next
reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple things lined up,
but that is definitely getting pushed up
[SPEAKER_00]: the list because it impressed me so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I'm just walking through a
grow, just minding my own business,
[SPEAKER_00]: and holy shit, that plant is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something just calls me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something just dings at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, when you're at the club,
when you're at wherever you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's sometimes a drum circle,
a fish concert, dead and co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where I could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just see somebody and your
jaw drops and your eyes go blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah, blah, like a cartoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to breed with that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the same feeling about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm a plant matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just see two plants and I go,
hey, Solomon, do you know strawberry star
[SPEAKER_00]: or strawberry field?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get together and a couple of
weeks ago, bro, we got, or a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks go by and we have got strawberry
starburst plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super rambling and kind of losing
track of where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get myself back on focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you feel like you have selected
a male plant, there is only one tried and
[SPEAKER_00]: true way to make sure that this dude is
what you think he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is in my opinion, to pollinate
multiple females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been preaching this method for quite
a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I say pollinate multiple females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you pollinate only one female
plant with this male, we only get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what the interaction is with one plant and
one set of offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say, and I'm going to just
start getting creative here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say we've got a chocolate
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody would like a chocolate male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is, it smells like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called chocolate something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a chocolate plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's just say we got a strawberry
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to breed chocolate to strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fucking delicious,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably going to get a lot of
chocolate strawberry phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't tell us a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me that when I breed chocolate
to strawberry, I get chocolate strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no gauge of what's really going on
other than I can see strawberry traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see chocolate traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two plants, they breed that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I want to breed it to multiple plants,
let's put chocolate to bananas and let's
[SPEAKER_00]: also put chocolate to vanilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do that, we're going to
grow out all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can see the commonalities that
come from this male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get big fat leaves in all of the
crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if all of the crosses show big fat
leaves, that shows me that's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I cross that same chocolate plant to
strawberry, vanilla, and banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and only banana gives me big fat leaves
and strawberry and vanilla give me skinny
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, maybe it's the banana cross that
is making those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If neither one of the plants showed big
leaves in the parent plant, that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: a recessive trait that we didn't know was
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I recommend breeding that
plant to multiple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see traits pop up in the breeding
that you didn't realize were coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a recessive trait,
like I just mentioned, let's say we cross
[SPEAKER_00]: that chocolate to the strawberry and we
get, they've both got really skinny leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and we cross those together and we get
real big leaves out of the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of those made that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is a recessive trait that
we've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that came from the male or
the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's talk about the dreaded
intersex, the hermaphrodite trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I cross my male to one plant and those
seeds are hermaphrodites or intersex,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I know if it came from that female
or that male plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I run that male to three different
girls, if one of them shows intersex,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's likely it was that one female that
held the intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If two of them are solid and not intersex,
we probably got a good male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all three of them are intersex,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the male that is doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I recommend using that male
to multiple females to actually see what
[SPEAKER_00]: he is doing, what he actually brings to
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's more fun than running
three different sets of new seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding out what you are driving
somewhere, you've got to have a goal or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off with the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a super crazy goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make seeds that look like plant
A and plant B together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be your goal, but write that
down so that you've got a real goal in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I recommend learning to make Mendel
charts, allele charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, learn Mendel charts,
allele charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study all of the breeder books you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about dominant traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about co-dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it comes time to breeding,
forget about all that and grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with love and use intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it comes to selecting the male
plant, find the plant that reaches your
[SPEAKER_00]: goal if that is possible or gets you as
close to your goal as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something with the shape and structure
that you're looking for, the leaf size and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape that you're looking for,
something that grows well, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers in the amount of time that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the plant that suits your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you the things that I like in
a male plant, but you've got to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that suits your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get you pretty close with ideas and
descriptions, but you've got to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude that is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be discouraged if your first
breeding project doesn't give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that male that grows in the amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the shape, the structure,
the leaf size, the leaf shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: the colors, the big flower structure that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you trellis your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you manipulate them a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that to this male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how he handles that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the male plant is going
to contribute heavily to the structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: your progeny, so select a male plant
that's got the shape and the structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard to test a male plant for
pathogen resistance, for pest resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you've got the opportunity,
definitely subject that male to some abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: and see how he responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that plant, like I've said before,
some stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress him out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drown him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drown him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do both back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But give him a little bit of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him some drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwater, underfeed, overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it responds to all of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're like myself,
if you're a commercial breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to make those seeds and send
them out to people, and then all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, no offense to you guys,
many of you are learning you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to underfeed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to give them drought
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to put them in fucked up
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am okay with that because you're a
new grower and that's what you're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I breed plants that I feel like are
going to be resistant to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tolerant to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding in a room that gets
super hot and it's real humid in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it never gets a dry time, grow your male
plants in there and find a male plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerates that super hot room and
tolerates that super, super humid area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will find a plant that works
perfectly in your room in the offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: have already got a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot like a farmer that has
selected seeds outdoor over generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: over generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's bred them in his outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made the right selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were on the same path doing the same
thing in doors if you use that sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
