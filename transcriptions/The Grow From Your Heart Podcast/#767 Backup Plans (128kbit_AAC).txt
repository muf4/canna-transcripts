[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you to a bunch
of friends that I saw this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to run into my buddy Nick Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see my good friend Erica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to boogie down with my buddy Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, I got to boogie down
and have a great weekend with the lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: Dread Vibes, also known as Zara,
also known as the queen of my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take her to see Fish where we
bumped into a bunch of great friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite band is Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did Four Nights at Dick's,
Sporting Goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sporting Goods Event Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sported the gigantic soccer field in
Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish did Four Nights there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was planning to go to all four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't miss a Fish show in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they come within a couple hundred
miles, I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got tickets for all four nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Miss Dread Vibes, also known as
Zara, if she would like to go with me for
[SPEAKER_00]: a night or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being not a Fish fan at the time,
she said she wanted to go to the first
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was great, but I am a Fish
fan and I know that you never miss a
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got her a ticket for the first night
and the last night, which was Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the first night, she looked at
me and she said, hey, babe, can I come
[SPEAKER_00]: with you tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I said yes, because there's
nothing better than Fish other than Fish
[SPEAKER_00]: with your favorite person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took her to the second night.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the second night, she said,
hey, babe, this was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yes, I already got you a
ticket for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ended up going to all four nights
because she loved the band Fish so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to describe the vibe,
the feeling of a Fish show, the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: event from pulling into the parking lot to
getting into the show, to seeing the band,
[SPEAKER_00]: to getting out of the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parking lot party, everything involved
in Fish is a big, fun, productive event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can describe it as.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to explain it to several people
and I've never gotten it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I took her there, she was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had such a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She smiled for the entire four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a big smile on her face.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day five, we were all sore and felt
like we were dying, but it was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to all the
friends that I saw there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ran into you at the Fish shows and I
was goofy, or short with you, and just
[SPEAKER_00]: said hi and walked away, or didn't seem
like I was all there, you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't fucking all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got nothing but love, nothing but
respect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some seeds, please do post
pictures of those when you grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me make sure I covered all
the notes and then we're going to jump
[SPEAKER_00]: into the main topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I got to take the beautiful dread
vibes to see Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran into our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Nick, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to a longtime friend,
Erica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker's the fucking mayor of Denver,
an awesome dude, and also got to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: longtime friend, an old friend,
my buddy Justin, who's a fellow drummer,
[SPEAKER_00]: fellow Fish nerd from back in the
Lawrence, Kansas day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to run into all those folks,
plus several other people that I saw ran
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make a note to say hi to those
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like we covered all of the main
business at the top of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just jump right into the main topic
of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently had the COVID-19 virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucked me up pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was down for 10 or 11 days feeling
really sick, then probably another solid
[SPEAKER_00]: week of not feeling well, and then another
couple of days of feeling like,
[SPEAKER_00]: damn, I just can't shake this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body felt ran down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My attention span was funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs were lacking oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice sounded like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in rough shape for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I had COVID, I was basically face
down, either in bed or on a couch for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 11 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get up to go pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would get back on the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd eat as much food as my body would
allow me to have, which wasn't much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would try to find the couch and the
air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so hot that I thought I was going to
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't function.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dizzy every time I stood up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I wanted to talk about today is
do you have some sort of a backup plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to get COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anything bad to happen to
you, but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want those things to happen to me,
but it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very minimally able to work in my
garden for the time that I was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a two week period where it was
just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants live, they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they die, they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you guys are probably
cringing hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how sick I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not care if the plants that operate
my business lived or died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do care deeply about that, but I was so
sick that it was like, go stand up and
[SPEAKER_00]: water those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stand up and I'd feel like I was
spinning in circles and wanted to throw up
[SPEAKER_00]: and do backflips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to do the backflips.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain was doing backflips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't really take care of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, do you have a backup plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there somebody in your circle,
your life, hopefully within your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly maybe they can water or wherever
your grow is, they can water your grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: you should you get sick, injured,
have to go away for a couple of days,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe get a job opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe fish comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go for four or five days and be
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some sort of a backup plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there somebody that can water those
plants for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that person know how to adjust and
check pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they know how to mix nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe now is a good time to think about
who would I call if I do have to go out of
[SPEAKER_00]: town?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would I call if I do get sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I always preach, especially in
illegal red state areas, I always preach,
[SPEAKER_00]: shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you have one person that you can
trust with your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I've been in this town for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of great friends,
a lot of family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one or two people I can heavily
rely on to take care of a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things do go completely wrong for me,
I've got people I can give instructions to
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus there's cameras in there so I can
guide them by using the cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have FaceTime now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you have somebody in your immediate
area that can come help you if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be somebody that you trust,
but also somebody that you know is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to follow the instructions, but also
somebody that when they mess it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how you're going to be able to
handle being mad at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you might be super pissed if this
person accidentally ruins your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a backup for sick days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an auto watering system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have somebody that can come in and
water for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have that auto water system,
it's going to need to be refilled
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those shouldn't go for more than a week,
maybe 14 days at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, if you got
water sitting in a reservoir, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want that there for too long, especially
if it's got nutrients in it, even if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, in my opinion, you're going to want
that changed out eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that person know how to change that
water for you, how to replenish and or I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to not even edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'm human, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that person know how to replenish and
or refill your reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you have somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to get hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have somebody that you can call if
you are to get hurt in your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in an illegal place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you don't want anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just don't need paramedics and
cops there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're working in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You poke yourself in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you get something in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you cut your finger and you just
need some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have somebody that you can call?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a way that you can do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you get some shit in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has really happened to somebody that
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got down in his eyes while mixing a
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could not see a fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in an illegal area, allegedly
growing illegally, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a fictional character.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do anything about a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know who he is anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude had down in his eyes and could
not figure out how to work his phone
[SPEAKER_00]: because he was blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, he was able to hold the phone up
and say, hey, Siri.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was able to call one of his
family members who lived nearby who was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to come and help him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just activated Siri on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was afraid that would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he used the hey Siri feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he called a family member.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came and helped him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something like that set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there somebody that knows about your
grow that if you call and you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I need some help, you can say it
discreetly over the phone and they know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can come help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be beneficial to you if you are
in some sort of a prohibition area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have somebody that can back you up all the
time, even if you are not in a prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: area because shit does go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, speaking of having backups,
I recently experienced a power outage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transformer near where my grow is
located exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seriously fucking exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no power for about 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a backup plan for no power?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a generator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some sort of idea of how to
get out of the grow if the lights go dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been in the grow and the
power goes out and it's completely dark in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't have my cell phone or most of
the time I carry a little pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: flashlight these days, if I didn't have
one of those devices, I would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuck in that grow would not have been
able to find my way out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have tripped over things,
broke a bunch of shit that could have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: terribly wrong for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have some sort of power backup
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a battery powered light?
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell these little lights at all the
plastic stores, the stores that sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them looks like a light switch and
you actually can just glue it or tape it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its own self adhesive on the back
and it sticks to the wall and it's a light
[SPEAKER_00]: switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you flip it up, the light comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you switch it down, the light goes
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is battery powered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if the electricity goes out,
it's still got a battery in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that, flip that on,
maybe find your way out of the grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sell some that are just little
domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tap them and they come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tap them and they go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen them on TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're as seen on TV sort of items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they sell those at all the
plastic stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe just get yourself a little carry
flashlight or a lot of us have our cell
[SPEAKER_00]: phone already, but have some sort of light
in case the power does go out in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do you know an electrician or have an
electrician friend or somebody that at
[SPEAKER_00]: least knows a little bit about
electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know an electrician or have an
electrician friend or somebody that knows
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit about electrical and wiring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you do experience a problem in
your home and you are in an illegal state,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you able to actually call whoever is
in the phone book or on the internet for
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical services?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need somebody on your team that
can handle electrical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful messing with electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it yourself if you're not
qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn the house down because you
decided to do electrical upgrades on your
[SPEAKER_00]: own and you have no idea what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts a very bad look on the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a step back for the
legalization and the freedom of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make friends with an electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know an electrician?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find somebody that maybe works at an
electric company or works for an
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical company that does installs or
something and buddy up with them and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they'll come do work for you on the
side so you don't have to involve too many
[SPEAKER_00]: receipts and books and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just find a friend is what I'm trying to
say be careful is what I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, same thing applies for an HVAC
technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the air conditioner or the heater does
go out in your house and you happen to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in that house, do you want to call
whatever it is, local ABC heating and
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want them in your house or do you
want one of the bros that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably pay with some product if things
go right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find an HVAC guy, find a plumber and find
a friend that you can call if you're to
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt yourself and find a friend that can
back you up if you do need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be really cool if this is all one
person but that would be a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a plumber, you got an electrician,
you got an HVAC guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like an apprentice and all of those
after working and grows for so long I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I can fake my way through most of
those but do you know all those guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be very, very helpful and
beneficial to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other things I want to talk about is
do you have backup pumps?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running hydroponics or any sort
of moving water sort of system,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep water culture, trays, ebb and flow,
do you have a backup pump?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a backup air pump and a backup
water pump?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those things love to shit out at
the worst time, usually like Friday,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven o'clock right after the grow store
closed and you got plants for the weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna hear a gah, gah, gah,
gah, gah, gah and that's gonna be your
[SPEAKER_00]: pump, not pumping water the way that it
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna take it apart, you're gonna
try to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it back together, throw it in
there and smoke's gonna come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta go get a new Monte pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's closed, just ruin your
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're a little bit expensive but
everything is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can have a backup pump,
that is one way and that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I definitely recommend having a
backup of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to have a backup pH tester
because sometimes my pH tester,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll calibrate it, I'll check it,
I'll throw it in there and if just maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: something will make me concerned,
I'll check it with the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have two just because shit does
go haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them both calibrated and cleaned
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrate them frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also maybe have backup testing standards
because if you test it in your seven
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, you test it in your four and one
of those has expired, now you're way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a backup testing standard solution as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're just getting crazy here but
these are things I do like to have backups
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I don't need a backup of,
something I want a couple of around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, especially since I've learned the
commercial growing environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need them every so many feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either 50 or 150 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys have a fire extinguisher in
your grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to need it but I'd rather
you have it and not need it than need it
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like, fuck, I don't have anything
and you're just throwing reservoir water
[SPEAKER_00]: on a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you have an eye wash station or
some sort of eye washing plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do have their grow at home
but a lot of people don't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: water right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we need water
very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a eye wash station very close for
the Department of Health and the OSHA
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you carry a bottle of
clean water on you or within reach in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get something in your eyes,
tear off your gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tear off your gloves, get that clean water
bottle, start pouring that water in your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes, get that contaminant or whatever it
is out of your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you need to, pull out the phone,
bust out the hey Siri, then call that one
[SPEAKER_00]: good friend that can come help you out and
make sure you're safe and help you clean
[SPEAKER_00]: up, talk you down from the panic attack
that you just fucking had from getting pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down or whatever it was in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm getting rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of notes here that I do
want to keep up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the next part I'm gonna talk
about is a little bit weird but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I do feel like we should be
prepared for, especially if you are in a
[SPEAKER_00]: red state or a non-friendly state.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly can you make your entire
operation disappear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say hypothetically,
you piss somebody off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens, people are fucking sensitive
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say somebody gets mad at you
and they know what you're doing and they
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the wrong people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the people are coming within 12 to
36 hours, they're gonna be not even
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking on your front door, they're gonna
be pulling the fucking front door off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you make your shit disappear within 12
to 24 to 36 hours with no sign that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: even there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do so, make sure you get rid of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way down to the mixing shot
glasses, all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: instructional books, clean up very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not leave a trace that anything has
happened, will happen, could have
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, no trace, leave no trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly can you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a place where growing is
not approved, tolerated or accepted,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be something that you want to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to be able to get rid of that
quite quickly if things do go wrong for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also very importantly, it helps to have a
good friend to help you stay level headed
[SPEAKER_00]: when things like that do happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a bro that can back you up?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there is one more person that
we do want to make sure to have on our
[SPEAKER_00]: team.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are going to be growing cannabis,
in any legal or illegal sort of fashion,
[SPEAKER_00]: which by the way, I should make a
disclaimer, Rasta Jeff and the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast does not condone,
promote or encourage you to do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always follow local laws and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break the rules, but you're a
fucking adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is also a fictional character
and this is an entertainment show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how that's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, the other person
that you should always have on your team,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are going to cultivate,
consume, possess, carry, transport,
[SPEAKER_00]: be anything involved in cannabis or almost
anything fun or illegal, I almost insist
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have got a good working
relationship with a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawyers are readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are fucking awesome and can
be your best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like your doctor, I recommend you are
totally open with your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've paid them money, everything
you say has a client lawyer
[SPEAKER_00]: confidentiality clause.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't snitch on you, rat on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kill somebody, they may be required
to tell on you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so though, but if you're
doing crime and you do something or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: did something or if you've got something
weird that is in a gray area, they cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is best you let them know what you're
doing so they can prepare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't properly prepare if they don't
know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them know exactly what you're up
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an idea, if you're going to
do something weird, if you're just curious
[SPEAKER_00]: about something, contact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay them, try to pay them a monthly
fee if you can for a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: contacts or have a retainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have a relationship with the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make friendship with them if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to lunch with them if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy them lunch occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see how things are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll call in and check in with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when shit goes wrong,
if it's three in the morning, if it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: in the afternoon, when you call them,
they answer on the first ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you want from your lawyer,
a lawyer that's going to answer on the
[SPEAKER_00]: first ring and do the work to get the case
dismissed because we all know you were not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing anything illegal or wrong or
problematic or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting off track here, but I do
recommend that you've got the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need somebody that can help us out
on a backup day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need somebody that can help us out if
we are injured or have an emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need someone that can help us make the
grow disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to have an electrician
and an HVAC guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, I always recommend that
you've got yourself a lawyer and then get
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of grow books and keep reading
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part took me right as long as I was
hoping it would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more part of this podcast
that I do want to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I did a podcast called Why I
Started Making Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a really long storytelling with
Rasta Jeff, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was editing and listening to that,
so many more thoughts and memories and
[SPEAKER_00]: nostalgic feelings came through my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot one minor major detail,
something that I felt like I should have
[SPEAKER_00]: included in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about making seeds and
getting seeds out to people so that people
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow quality plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that was happening is I was
posting pictures of things like Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is a very good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would post pictures of Golden Goat,
and people in other locations would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you kids in Colorado are spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get the Golden Goat where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would kill for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do anything for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me being the type of person that I am,
I want everybody to have good medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part of my mission here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That still is part of my mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out here teaching you how to grow the
best herb you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taught you guys how to breed by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed breeder by career, and I'm
teaching you how to breed your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much I love this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love teaching you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted everybody to have access to good
quality genetics, good seeds at a good,
[SPEAKER_00]: fair price, and many, many people wanted
the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it upon myself to make Golden Goat
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the things I really wanted
to do was put some of these elite cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: into people's hands in a feminized form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat is a very good example of
me putting a feminized line of a very
[SPEAKER_00]: elite clone only out to the market for
people all over the world to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making fem seeds and making S1s of
clone onlys was something I really enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: doing because that was making it more fair
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of everybody having the
same, the equal playing field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should some people in Colorado be able
to produce better medicine than people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming or New Mexico or Arizona or even
California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should the people in California be
able to produce better medicine than the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in Colorado or New York or the same
states?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all have access to the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sick, you need medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is still my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sick, why would I not get you
the Golden Goat that would make you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better just because you're not in the
correct state?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the government has been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been limiting you, us,
on medicine because you're not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate square that allows you to
consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This square, no weed, no relief,
no feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This square, you could feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that every state, everywhere,
every country, every sick person,
[SPEAKER_00]: every well person should feel good and or
better was my theory behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to add that short rant,
that minor detail, that point of passion,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, to this part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that another part B of why I started
breeding seeds because I wanted it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have just me with elite
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having elite genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way everybody around here gets to
grow and breed with elite fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's well medicated, super high and
having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then part of my passion is making
people feel better, not a limited amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, let's be fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that shit out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big part of why I wanted to
make fems, especially S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of why I'm getting the
seeds out there so that everybody can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the good shit and feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody grow the best herb we can so the
sick people can feel well and the well
[SPEAKER_00]: people can feel even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that is a good way and
a good time to start wrapping up this
podcast.
