[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of fat so
number one full spectrum extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of GMO and legend og on
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as dark roast,
garlic and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is also a hint of bar trash
can in here, which may sound disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I honestly love this gross funky aroma
that comes from the fat zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is definitely a dark roast aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a garlic there's a fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there is also I keep saying it a
hint of funky bar trash can and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing the diamonds to the camera
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 82.68% THC and non detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can tell by the intro of this
podcast that the dab I just took fucked me
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My chest is caving in my lungs feel a
little bit heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over here trying to catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can hear it into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: My green dot labs for the delicious fat so
number one full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are nice and low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm chilling out in the new chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on the video,
I'm sure you've noticed by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording from a brand new recording
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've set up a new little office space
slash recording area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be getting the equipment dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be getting the office recording space
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I could use is a studio name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every recording studios got a cool studio
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a studio name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys send me your submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me a tweet on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFY podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me a message on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the grow from your heart podcast on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or of course, send me an email grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me name my brand new studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got a very important thing I
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say happy birthday to
Motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording on Subcool's birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following me for a while,
you know that I learned a lot from
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Subcool is a very controversial
figure in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either love him or hate him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nothing but love and respect for
the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me what to do and I keep saying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also taught me what not to do in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was way ahead of me in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without his template, his guidance,
his input, his friendship and advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not be the grower, the breeder,
the podcaster that I am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy birthday, Motherfucking Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish you were still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish I could send you a message and you
reply with some fucking off the wall crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that I did not expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep growing in your honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did cross your Jack the Ripper to a
bunch of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collabed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool and I talked about collabing quite
often, but he always had so much going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were so far apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so far away and I always had a lot
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took the liberty of crossing his
Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated a bunch of my elite females
and some of my favorite female cuts with
[SPEAKER_00]: that Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to start asking for them
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be sent out to testers very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow a bunch out myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, wanted to send love to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my whole point of that big rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy motherfucking birthday to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, big man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish you were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We celebrated Subcool today on Instagram a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Queen V and Will went on and did a one
hour live session where they smoked a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint that was about the size of a small
baseball bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were normal people at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end, they were talking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pale and red faced at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were drooling and dizzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to those folks for keeping
Subcool spirit alive today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show where we need
to give some love to Subcool, and it's
over.

[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my stoner
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see where we are next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've caught up on all the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part's been handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the main topic of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep seeing a bunch of bullshit on the
internet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that they can identify the
sex of a seed by looking at the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that they've got gorilla glue
for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some bullshit that I keep
reading on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things that I've been
seeing, and this is a long old school myth
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm here to dispel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant your cannabis plants near
blueberries or near strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's going to make your
plants taste like fucking blueberries or
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the trick to get blueberry or
strawberry flavored or scented cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is bread, selectively bred into the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find a strain that tastes like
strawberries a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We breed that to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find a phenotype that tastes a little
bit more strawberry than last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we use that plant and possibly the
old strawberry phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get rid of all of the phenotypes that
aren't even more strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We breed that flavor in, or maybe we're
breeding it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bringing it out and breeding that
for you to have your strawberry or
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry flavored cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that 10 times fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll fuck it up too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rumor that you can make your herb
taste like strawberries or blueberries or
[SPEAKER_00]: apples by growing it near strawberries,
blueberries, or apples is very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get a hint of it, maybe possibly,
but I don't think it's going to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: have that bold blueberry strawberry aroma
flavor that people want it to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't think feeding your plants
juices and shit are going to have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed your plants blueberry juice,
you're not going to get blueberry flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is some evidence to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us feed our plants a lot of
really funky flavored and smelling things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that are running the KNF,
the Korean Natural Farming, doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented fruit juices, that stuff doesn't
smell like berries and bubblegum,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when they grow their herb,
it smells like berries and bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people put bat shit, cow shit,
horse shit, chicken shit into their herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell and taste like bat shit,
cow shit, goat shit, or chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rumor, the idea, the myth that
cannabis will taste like berries should
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant it near berries has just been
debunked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit saying that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I want to debunk today is
that you can judge the ripeness of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants by the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear people, I see people on social
media say that you can tell if your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is done by the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, if you're saying hairs,
you're already off on the wrong foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those pistols do not indicate
ripeness of your cannabis plants in any
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the sex glands of your female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are there to pick up pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flapping in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen lands on that, slides down
that, ends up in the ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a seed forms inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has nothing to do ... We're not
smoking pistols, are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't look at the pistols and go,
those are great for smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are smoking trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not measure the ripeness of our plant
by the thing we are going to consume,
[SPEAKER_00]: the part that contains the active
ingredient that we want to consume?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not judge the trichomes by the amount
of THC, the ripeness of the THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, judging your plant's
ripeness by the pistols or the hairs is
[SPEAKER_00]: like judging the ripeness of an apple by
looking at the dirt underneath the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not do you a bit of fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot determine the ripeness of your
cannabis plants by looking at the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols will change colors if they get
sprayed with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols will change colors if they get
too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols can change brown and wither up
if they get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols will wither up and dry if you
touch them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe an insect damaged them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they got too much sun exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that plant has passed its
pollination point and it is no longer able
[SPEAKER_00]: to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants only want pollen up till
about day 40, but we flower them until
[SPEAKER_00]: about day 65 or 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, judging by those pistols is a failure
to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going really fast, but I am kind of
just trying out this new gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving because what if this
does not sound really good and I record a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am going to move on to the next
motherfucking rumor I would like to dispel
[SPEAKER_00]: today on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am moving to another page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a couple that I am trying to
save here because I am doing them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot, cannot, not, cannot,
impossible to visually identify the sex of
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis seed by looking at that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that were possible, I would pay you to
come sort out all of the male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from my seed batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep the males so I could grow
nothing but elite males for myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: have killer breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we would sell all of the female
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can guarantee you they were females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female seeds cost twice as much as
non-female seeds, non-feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you could do that magic trick for
me, I would hire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that little chart that you
see on social media that says if it has
[SPEAKER_00]: got this shape to it or this pointy tip
here, this volcano shape here or an acorn
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped here, that is complete and total
motherfucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Debunked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff calls bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do it, if you can prove it,
come to my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will let you number them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One through 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will veg them until they are two inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that two inches?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will veg them until they are three and
a half inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how tall GI Joe is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three and three quarters, that is this
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg them until they are as tall as GI Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are going to flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to remember everyone you
marked, male and female, we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: write it down on the container in which
that seed is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to have documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are 90% right, I will be fucking
amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are 70% right, I might still be
impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% is just fucking lucky guesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to be more than 60 or 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt you are going to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never seen anybody accurately do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not fucking believe it one bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do it, come on over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will fucking pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a prize involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you cannot visually identify the sex
of seeds by looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say, what about
feminine seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they are female seeds because I
made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what if I fuck with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I give you a bunch of seeds and
tell you to sex them for me and I put some
[SPEAKER_00]: female seeds in there that I know are
fems?
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute I see you say, this one is a
boy, you are already wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we already know that your whole
fucking theory is all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you cannot identify seeds by looking
at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want to go with next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got two more big ones that I know
are going to let me rant for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not too far into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us talk about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just drives me nuts
professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an industry, as a community,
as a movement, we need to work toward more
[SPEAKER_00]: professionalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way we can do that is by using proper
terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, those hairs are called
pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already sound more credible,
more educated, more advanced if you say
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols and quit saying hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let us work on another word that
drives me fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not care, that is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to give you a heads up if you
want to sound a little bit more educated
[SPEAKER_00]: and be taken a little more seriously in
the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us talk about the word hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermy drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermy is not a fucking word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermaphrodite is the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to say hermy,
just say herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not put the me on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, it sounds very juvenile,
very elementary school, very
[SPEAKER_00]: playgroundish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermy, I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bothers the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the word is not hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant shows male and female sex
parts, that plant carries intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us wipe the word hermy out of our
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe herm if you are typing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us work on intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant shows intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not go herm on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It showed intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I want to address that
falls right into this category,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a sub note of this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people saying that there was a male
plant near their plants and it made their
[SPEAKER_00]: females turn hermaphroditic and seed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that is not what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us think about basic biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has got male pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has got, what did we talk about
earlier, pistols and ovules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how does nature work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do boys and girls do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen, which is basically the sperm,
hits the pistol, which takes that pistol
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ovule, which is where babies are
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like in nature, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is spermming up the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants that you were saying that
some people on social media keep saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants were near a male plant and they
hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucked and your plant is pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is seeded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No herming happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let a male go and that male pollinated
that female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is biology 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to move on from talking about
plants fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to quit saying like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure a couple of people threw up in
their mouths every time I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us talk about another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people do not even
understand what I am talking about when I
[SPEAKER_00]: say clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us pick the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue number four is a plant that
is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue four was bred by Josie Wales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, brother Josie Wales.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is no longer with us, but his work
lives on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue four is known as number four
because there was a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four was the prize seedling out of
that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably had, I am going to assume
since I have seen gorilla glue seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to assume there were ten
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just guessing hypothetically, follow me
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got ten plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend has named them gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably did not name them until after
he smoked them and smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, let us focus on the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grew them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He realized number four and number seven
are the fucking keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smokes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am assuming and making this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my assumption here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not fucking criticize me too much,
but this is how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smokes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He realizes this smells or tastes like
gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names it gorilla glue, but there are ten
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got numbered gorilla glue one
through ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boys probably got removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got put in another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females got to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is probably five girls, five boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hypothetically, that is how breeding
and selecting works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those five, there was number four and
number seven amongst that five,
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got their number indications because
of the specific phenotype that those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were from that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, gorilla glue number four is a
selected cut, which was selected by Josie
[SPEAKER_00]: Wales.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was named gorilla glue and the cut was
number four because it was probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth plant in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, gorilla glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is it a clone only?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Josie never put out a male plant
of the gorilla glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never released a male, so it is clone
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no unadulterated seeds of
gorilla glue number four available on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market unless Josie put them out and he
did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he did breed to it, they wouldn't be
gorilla glue number four seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be gorilla glue number four
crossed to something which would lose the
[SPEAKER_00]: name gorilla glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this in a couple of other
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody took a gorilla glue number four
plant and bred to it, you can make seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are not gorilla glue four.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now adulterated gorilla glue four
seeds bred to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gorilla glue four X other plant
crossed to another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way it is possible to have pure
gorilla glue number four seeds is to have
[SPEAKER_00]: S1 feminized gorilla glue number four
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is we took a gorilla glue
number four plant, the official clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the selection that Josie Wales
selected himself and labeled number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take that plant, take two
clones of that same plant, treat one with
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple ways to reverse a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I recommend silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply silver thiosulfate to the one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will create pollen sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply that pollen to the female plant at
the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have produced gorilla glue number
four S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have self the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no other genetics within that
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way that you can have gorilla
glue number four seeds is if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, those seeds people are selling
you giving you trading to you offering you
[SPEAKER_00]: are bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not gorilla glue number four,
unless they reverse to it and made
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this in other terms that
may make it more clear for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about an animal that is nearly
extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to create an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call it the purple wombat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one female purple wombat left
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to make more?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not because there's only one fucking
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One purple wombat on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to get some sperm from?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no dudes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to make more purple
wombats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how biology and breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one female of gorilla glue
number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was never a male released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josie didn't put out the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make more unadulterated crosses
without the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my rant on clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone only means that there was never
seeds or a male released to make seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, breeders like myself have kind
of fucked this all up and started making
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to give a shout out to Dr. Dank who
made the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Dank, Dr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for getting it wrong on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm live on the spot trying to keep up
with my own brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Dank made golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired the golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no male of golden goat available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy put out the clone of golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: No seeds, no male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I got a hold of it and made that S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: My purpose for making the S1 is because
people in other places were seeing my
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of golden goat and saying,
that's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have some of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really easily ship clones all over
the place, but allegedly we can get you
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made golden goat seeds from a golden
goat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a golden goat, took two clones of
it, treated one with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied that pollen onto a female golden
goat, the same plant, just two clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the clone, then I made seeds
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are golden goat, S1,
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only way you can get pure
unadulterated golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've made a golden goat back cross,
which means I took a plant that was very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to golden goat and crossed it to
the golden goat and the offspring looks
[SPEAKER_00]: very much like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about my process in depth in a
couple of episodes, but that is a back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since there is not a male of golden goat
available, I had to use a different male
[SPEAKER_00]: to put pollen on that plant to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not pure golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my responsibility as a responsible
breeder to label that as the back cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my rant on clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my rant and my reasoning on why
there is no gorilla glue fucking seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my rant on why there's no golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my rant on why there are no girl
scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these plants were clone only and
there were no options for other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only person that had the seeds were
the guys that made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I make a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something I'm not going
to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to tell you some shit
that I've got going on that I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that I took a rise and I
crossed it to this new blue kombucha
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a blue kombucha bottle in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new fucking strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rise to blue kombucha bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow out 25 seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find the fucking champion
female out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this amazing arise to blue
kombucha female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call it kombucha rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how my brain works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kombucha rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm never going to give anybody a
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hoard these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue kombucha rise seeds all go in my
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're locked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that they won't germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this one plant that I grew this
blue kombucha rise that I selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rid of all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't fucking elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one blue kombucha rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it because there's no mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't give anybody any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I gave you the clone, but I will
never give you the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make more of that unless you
adulterate it with other pollen or you
[SPEAKER_00]: self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my rant on clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue for Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of other things out there
that are clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dream is clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that popular shit that you guys
are really seeking is clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of why I'm doing this rant is to
let you know to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to educate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to educate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful in your quest for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get duped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for false labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for a seed brand, a seed vendor
that's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying only shop with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that have been
around a lot longer than me that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other things to offer that I don't
offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be very careful when you're shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got blue dream, if they've got
gorilla glue, if they've got Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, and it just says regular seeds
and doesn't tell you what it's crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: with be very leery of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: skateboarders, seed hoarders, all you bad
motherfuckers out there in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
