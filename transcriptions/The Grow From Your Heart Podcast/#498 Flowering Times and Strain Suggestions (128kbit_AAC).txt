[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, alright, alright, we are rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 498 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start this episode off with
a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am currently heating up the dab nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a pretty fat dab of first-class
funk live batter from Green Dot Labs on
[SPEAKER_00]: the dabber here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of GMO and jet fuel
gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as hashy,
grape, fuel, and garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I get the grape in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I for sure get the hashy and the garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely get some funk which is
appropriate because it is called
[SPEAKER_00]: first-class funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flip over the package here
and read the back of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the product does contain 68.77%
THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking a lot of the first-class
funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is readily available at my local shop
and they sell it in these 4 gram jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the 4 gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about cracking open a jar and
seeing that big 4 gram dollop in there
[SPEAKER_00]: always makes me happy and I go through a
little bit of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very economical way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less jars, less trips, less purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this dab is ready for me to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 498 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a stoned quick Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can get through the intro
before I start coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now and of
course, you can find them at www
[SPEAKER_00]: .seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I can feel that first-class funk
dab just radiating through my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started at my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of working its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arms are getting a little heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head feels a little fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are absolutely heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting that droopy-eyed stoneness,
that mellow feeling that we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have to turn down the heater and
kick off my shoes here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first-class funk dab is kicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to read a
couple of quick emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some
shout-outs to the folks who support the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on Patreon.

the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would like to learn how to
support the show, you can do so by
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting www.patreon.com forward slash
Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like we've got all the
business taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the main part of today's
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to read a couple of
emails, so let's get right to that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get an email from a listener who
gave me a lot of great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I replied to them personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, however, forget to print out that
email before I deleted it, so I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the email in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part I wanted to address on the
show was they asked specifically why I do
[SPEAKER_00]: not do a video show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very good answer for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that answer is the Grow From Your
Heart podcast is a one-man show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write all of the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produce all of the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all of the social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nobody else involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: show other than when my guests come and be
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only thing anybody else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up and talk into a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to come up with an idea for an
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these ideas don't come out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to create something to talk about
for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first task is just having something
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got to kind of put a couple of
notes together to have a roadmap of maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a few bullet points that I want to make
sure to cover and notes that I should make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to hit in a Grow lesson or in a Grow
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically have to manifest a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I need to put it on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from the paper, I need to sit down
and put it into the microphone and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's in the computer, I need to go
back and edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how long it took me to record
the show, I will be sitting here for that
[SPEAKER_00]: length of time again, listening back to
the show to make sure everything sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: good, to make sure you don't get too much
throat clearing, make sure you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: too many coughs, make sure you don't get
too many ums and make sure I didn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: any mistakes in a Grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've manifested a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've recorded a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've edited the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are a few more buttons to push
after that to get the show up to the RSS
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once that is complete, I make a just
a basic video for the show to put up on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mostly a few static images that
rotate every couple of minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that does take a few minutes to
produce that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get that up to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to type in all the video
descriptions and make sure that I age
[SPEAKER_00]: restrict my video so I don't get taken
down by YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does take me a little bit of time
and a little bit of energy to create this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to add the video aspect to the
show, it would probably double or triple
[SPEAKER_00]: my workload because video is much more
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have multiple cameras because you
need multiple cameras for good editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would make editing completely
more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take a lot more time to edit the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Audio recording and audio editing has
become simple to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Video editing is very challenging and very
time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of me feels like just taking the
time away from this show to learn the
[SPEAKER_00]: video equipment to get good at video
editing and actually produce a video would
[SPEAKER_00]: take away from the overall quality of the
audio show that I give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I put out a fairly high
quality podcast in many aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audio quality should be quite high
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I put quite a bit of effort
into making sure I give an accurate and
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to do it in a way that people
that learn from multiple different styles
[SPEAKER_00]: will catch on and be able to learn from
one show because there are people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: visual learners people that are hands on
learners, people that are book learners
[SPEAKER_00]: and people that just have a hard time
learning in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to explain things in a way that
everybody can catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why sometimes you hear me just
beating a dead horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I repeat the same thing multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes that fourth way that I said
it is the way that that one guy over there
[SPEAKER_00]: finally it all made sense to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, oh, like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first three descriptions didn't
make any sense to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to give a really thorough
description and lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to paint a picture so that
everybody can see the goal of what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if I spent too much time
making a video, it would take away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of those lessons of that
detailed grow knowledge that I give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to take away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate that you want to see my
lovely face while I'm doing a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it is the same thing as me doing
an Instagram live video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen me on Instagram live,
it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sitting here rambling,
except when the podcast is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got headphones and a microphone on
the Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wear headphones and I don't have a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never caught my Instagram lives,
every Monday at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time, it's usually about 710,
715 ish Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know your time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jump on Instagram live and I go on live
for an hour and answer grow questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: take some dads and bullshit with my
friends on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never joined me for that,
I invite you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means to feel blessed,
pleasant and powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my genetics are Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel good and they're powerful and
they are pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Iri underscore genetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to check out my Instagram
live feeds on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be your video visual
representation for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not missing much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's honestly me just sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I wave my hands around in the
air when I speak just to give myself some
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I point at certain directions
just randomly because I use my hands when
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not really missing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the short answer to that long
ramble was I don't do video because it
[SPEAKER_00]: would detract from the quality of the
audio podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that video would be fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would probably only be one show
every week if I did video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to take that away from my
friends and my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your grow is going great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have printed your email so
that I could give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to dial in the rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get to the next email on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hi, I have a question about the
flowering times listed for your feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: golden coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you state that the flowering time is
60 to 70 days, is that from the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: change to a 1212 light cycle or from the
point when the first flower appears?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they signed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Todd, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when you buy a package of
seeds, it will say how long to expect
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds to take in their flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my packages of golden goat,
it says flowering time is 60 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person wants to know if we start
that 60 to 70 day count from the day we
[SPEAKER_00]: switch the lights to 1212 or from when
those plants start to show their first pre
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that is you start your
flowering cycle the day you flip your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that first day you've got your plants
on 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when it begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you flip the timer, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in full control of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day one is when you flip that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Todd, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you've got any more grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck in your garden, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from somebody who calls
themselves wags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says use my name if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call me wags.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, wags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those words of encouragement do
keep me charged up and keep me going for
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say it says I am in
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety is not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually at the mercy of whatever my
guy could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, unfortunately, if you are not in a
regular regulated cannabis area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're basically buying what is available
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy says because of this,
I have decided to grow my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be careful down there in prohibition
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've read a couple of books and
listened to a ton of podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours has by far been my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you give a lot of knowledge in a
way that almost anyone could understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's awesome, because that's what I
was rambling about just a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're picking up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says maybe you should write a
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought about writing a book
and I probably rambled about this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast before I started off by thinking I
wanted to write a cannabis grow book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I was reading grow books,
I noticed that as soon as a book came out,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically that information was out of
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is evolving so quickly right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is evolving so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science behind cannabis and growing
are rapidly advancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to write a book by the time I
got to Chapter 12, Chapter one would be
[SPEAKER_00]: obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time that book got to a
publisher, it would be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time that book got to you,
it would be last year's fucking news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't be relevant any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized the way I could keep this
information up to date was by doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can record a show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I learn something tomorrow,
I can record another show the next day and
[SPEAKER_00]: go, hey, you guys, I learned some new
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're going to do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can come out here and I can update
you and I can just give you fresh content,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh updates as it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought a book was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a podcast felt more practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like podcasts seem to reach
more people now anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody reads anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like half the people who bought
the Jorge Cervantes grow Bible or an Ed
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosenthal grow book, set it next to the
toilet and forgot to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go to one of my friend's house and I
go to take a piss, there's always a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: book by the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has never moved since the first
time I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell they are not reading the grow
books, but they do listen to podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've got to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to be at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants some sort of entertainment
in their ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got ADD and a podcast is a great
way to feed that ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it was easier just to talk
and let people listen instead of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: force people to read a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message says, well, the purpose of
this message is just to say thank you and
[SPEAKER_00]: let you know that you're doing a great
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate hearing the praise and the
words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my main goal for growing is
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a strain which you can recommend
for PTSD, depression and anxiety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any information is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You Rock signed WAGS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey WAGS, that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dive into what I can suggest for
PTSD, depression and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I go giving recommendations,
I do probably have to give a disclaimer
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm not a doctor, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no medical certifications at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white guy with dreadlocks who has a
lot of experience in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my knowledge comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't take any of this as medical
advice or medical recommendations or don't
[SPEAKER_00]: sue me or none of that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just bro to bro talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the irie genetics lineup,
the things I've noticed that work very
[SPEAKER_00]: well for PTSD, depression and anxiety are
things like lemon juice, lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffery is very soothing for social
anxiety and anxiety in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also seems to help with depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that would probably also ease
some PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lemon jeffery is a recommendation I
would start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would move to the sun kiss and
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in that orangey turp really
makes good moods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it may sound weird, but orange
turps always put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that when most people
smoke the orange turpy stuff, they really
[SPEAKER_00]: get a smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get in a better mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get uplifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that it eases the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that it puts you in a good mood,
which will help fight the depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those types of things will lead to
kind of warding off the PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you forget you've got PTSD
because you're in too good of a mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: just bouncing around smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the irie genetics lineup,
I would start with the lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limonene in there really seems to work
well for anxiety and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, those will lead well to helping
with the PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would work over to the sun kiss or
the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun kiss is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference, I've talked about
this in a previous show, is the sun kiss
[SPEAKER_00]: has a rise in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be more prone to have
some funky or gassy feet kind of smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the orangegasm doesn't have the
daybreaker trait in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to get that gassy funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more sweet, more orangey,
maybe a possibility of maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit, maybe some orange rind type of
turps coming from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those orange turps always seem to work
well for the PTSD, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always think the orange turps get people
talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get you social and they get you
moving a little bit more than some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: piney turps, some of the gassy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that stuff is a little mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like it makes you just
too high to even fucking communicate with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the fruitier, the lemon,
the orangey stuff may be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I recommended some irie
genetics strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should mention some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I did not breed give you a few
more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really find that jilly bean works well
for anxiety and depression and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does that same thing for getting
you going in a social situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's got that really orange
turp to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find an orange phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find what is called the candy
store phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them will work well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also want to experiment with CBD
dominant genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine that is higher in CBD may be the
way you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if CBD or THC is going to
be the way to go for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may want to experiment with CBD
products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD will help with the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD will help with the depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD will possibly help with the PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are no bad side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's not working, it's just not
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only negative of the CBD is it may
kind of cut down on your THC buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd really like to have a nice THC
high, the CBD will kind of cut that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a CBD breeder or a CBD grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were looking for quality CBD
seeds, I could recommend Med Tree Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of great high quality CBD
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many other CBD dominant
strains on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know I've got a lot of information
and this may get confusing, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: rewind and listen a couple of times and
take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that may be an option for
you is different ratios of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may start with a one to one,
a 50-50 mix of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting too much head effect
from it, put more CBD in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting enough effect from
it, add more THC to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with this is you are in
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to have a lot of
options for lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you can probably do is get a
package of real CBD tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it is real CBD from a reputable
CBD company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make any recommendations
right now because no matter who I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get 20 emails from people
telling me why they are shit and that
[SPEAKER_00]: their company is better, but find a
reputable CBD distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a tincture and take that tincture as
recommended for two or three days if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can handle it, if you don't have any
adverse effects you don't enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a day or two, see if your depression
and anxiety are starting to ease up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD could be the answer and this is a very
easy way to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we experiment with the CBD and it
doesn't do anything, then it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying your medicine from a
black market or a gray market or a
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever kind of free market, whatever you
want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting it from your dude,
that is probably a THC heavy product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably what your guy is focusing
on growing and distributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some of that and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that to how you got effects from
the CBD tincture that you took.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now which one is working best for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is probably the best way to
decipher if you need CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know what I'm going to say next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not smoke a fat joint and do a big
dropper full of that CBD tincture and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got THC and CBD in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll start finding the ratios that
work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you want to start researching
the seeds that you want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want CBD or do you want something
with a nice blend?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then start researching specific seeds
with those specific ratios of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you just need CBD, find my friends
at MedTree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you need the high THC, grab yourself
some Lemon Jeffrey, some Sunkiss or some
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Gasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main problem is that you don't have a
testing facility there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to find the seeds
that get your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will have to smoke each plant
individually and see which one works best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just keep a clone of that and
continue to grow that plant perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got the medicine that works
best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without lab testing, you kind of have
to do things the long way and the hard
[SPEAKER_00]: way, unfortunately, until you get out of
prohibition land or until you change the
[SPEAKER_00]: laws around cannabis in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that was a really long
answer to what could have been a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answers are Lemon Jeffrey,
Sunkiss, Orange Gasm, and Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if those don't work for you,
maybe try some CBD and experiment with the
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since you've already bought some
CBD tincture, why not combine them and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if it works better for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just what I would do if I was
trying to help a friend figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: works best for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in Colorado, we would go to a
dispensary and we would buy lab tested
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say, this one's got this much
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got this much CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would take you home and we would
roll up a joint of each one and we'd smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: one and see what happens to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a couple hours, smoke the other one,
see what happens to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd go, which one worked better,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd go, this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd already have answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, shit doesn't work that way
in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to go about it the long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, wags, I hope I was able to help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more questions, please send
me a follow up email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
all you bad motherfuckers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is time for me to wrap up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am stoned and rambly and slightly out of
focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some friends coming over here in
a little bit, so I want to clean up,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of get ready for them to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening to this
episode.

[SPEAKER_02]: Roses die.
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer came, the wind and rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gold and heat are veiled and gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many leaves are blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what remains, the wind and rain.
Like
[SPEAKER_02]: a desert spring that comes and spreads
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a song that's born to soar in the
sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glowing into the water, so I try.
Glowing into the water, so I try.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sands of time, the seasons will end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It jumbles round.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little change, the wind and rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a desert spring that comes and
spreads away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a song that's born to soar in the
sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glowing into the water, so I try.
Glowing by
[SPEAKER_02]: the red fog and rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see summer come again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darkness falls and seasons change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see more friends, the wind and
rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see summer by and by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter, gray, and falling rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seasons fade and roses die.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see summer come again.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the state of mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darkness falls and seasons change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see more friends, the wind and
rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a song that's born to soar in the
sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Born and come, she follows the path
through the river shore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the sun, her sun is the lash on the
morning star.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the sun, sparkle in the rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a silver bead, faster than the sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: She comes from the town where they call
her the woodcutter's daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's brown at the bank where she kneels
down to gather her water.
[SPEAKER_02]: She bears it away with the love that the
river has started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it flow, really flow, white and clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Round and round, the cut of the flower in
the fur field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves are round, the bushes are gone in
the barley mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Broken ground, whooping and beckoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Children sing like they're living in
heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plumb and his bribe is the back of the
land he sowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: As he dances the second track of the plumb
of the north.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the work of his days, measures more
than the planting and growing.
Let it flow, let it flow, white and clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: What shall we say, shall we fly and fly
then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look out, the angels dancing on the
hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water bright as the sky from which it
came.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beneath us are the earth that takes it
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's take a stand inside the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes, we make what we make since the
world began.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter, the love of the women,
the work of men.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seas and swamps, creatures great and
small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up and down, to rise and fall.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: What shall we say, shall we call it
planning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look out, the angels dancing on the
hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water bright as the sky from which it
came.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beneath us are the earth that takes it
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's take a stand inside the ride.
And listen to the thunder shout.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am,
I am.
I am, I am, I am, I am.
I am, I am, I am.
