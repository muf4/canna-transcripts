[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 873 of the grow from your
heart podcast You know, I've got another
[SPEAKER_01]: fun episode lined up for us in today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give away free seeds hang out
We'll talk more about those free seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: later on in today's show before we jump
into the question and answer portion of
[SPEAKER_01]: today's podcast I want to talk about
something that I noticed while I was
[SPEAKER_01]: watering my own garden I recently turned
on the water And I got a very strong
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach sort of a smell coming from my
local tap water What I realize is it is
[SPEAKER_01]: now the springtime and they have changed
the municipal water to the spring
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment Most of the municipal water
plants will change how they treat the
[SPEAKER_01]: water based on the season They recently
upgraded or updated to the spring seasonal
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment and my water treatment area So
my water does smell different which means
[SPEAKER_01]: my pH is different My EC is different the
PPMs my water are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're one of those people that
water your plants If you mix your
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients based on memory if you're like
if I use this many mils of this and this
[SPEAKER_01]: much of this product and mix this much
shit together Then I need seven drops of
[SPEAKER_01]: pH down right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to adjust your schedule
adjust your mix Give that a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give yourself a heads up Set yourself
up for success and check the pH of your
[SPEAKER_01]: final mix Maybe even check the pH of the
water coming out just for shits and
[SPEAKER_01]: giggles for scientific reasons then check
the pH Of your mix and see if you do need
[SPEAKER_01]: to adjust your mix and your habits and or
your strategies in any way shape or form
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I did notice a strong aroma of
bleach and I noticed my pH was a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit different So I did have to make
adjustments to my regular habits my
[SPEAKER_01]: regular mixing pattern did need to get
adjusted So I recommend you check on yours
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't make any mistakes if your
plants are looking weird if they look like
[SPEAKER_01]: shit Possibly you have fed them something
that I was a little too rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit too hot We might want
to check on the pH Of that final solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that is my public service
announcement here to start this episode I
[SPEAKER_01]: did say that I'm going to give away free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website that website is I read
genetics calm on the top of that website
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a row of tabs one of those tabs
does say grow help or grow questions If
[SPEAKER_01]: you click on that tab You are given the
opportunity to send me a good grow
[SPEAKER_01]: question If you send me a good grow
question and I read your question here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast I will send you a coupon code
for a free pack of seeds on My vending
[SPEAKER_01]: website I read direct comm today's first
question from that grow help tab did come
[SPEAKER_01]: from somebody who wants to be called Rhino
Big shout out to my new friend Rhino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Rhino Make sure you check your inbox
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds at I read direct comm
The question from my new friend Rhino goes
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot like this It says does transplanting
up going from one gallon to three gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: to five gallon fabric pots Why not just
leave it in the pot instead of taking it
[SPEAKER_01]: out?
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots grow through the pot and it
doesn't seem to slow the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know cutting roots makes more roots What
is better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this person is asking about I
always recommend going In graduated pot
[SPEAKER_01]: sizes if that's possible for your grow
space What I mean by that is we start off
[SPEAKER_01]: with our clone or our seedling Don't put
that in a seven gallon pot put that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: beer cup or a four inch net pot or a six
inch pot Put that in a smaller pot be more
[SPEAKER_01]: economical with your space your soil your
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more cost-effective And then I
recommend once that plant gets root bound
[SPEAKER_01]: or close to root bound in that container
Graduate to the next size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go from the small pot to the one gallon
then into a three maybe a five I don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: much up potting after that But I would go
incrementally instead of just going from
[SPEAKER_01]: the small to the giant pot There are
several reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I controls the root growth a little bit I
like a nice kind of I like it when it just
[SPEAKER_01]: starts to get tight in that container when
you put it into the next container it
[SPEAKER_01]: really explodes also, you don't have to
take up as much space if you're only
[SPEAKER_01]: running a tiny tiny plant a seven gallon
pot takes up a lot of space and space is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most valuable things for a Any
kind of cultivator or farmer so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need as much space You don't need as much
water because you don't have to water that
[SPEAKER_01]: big volume of a pot You don't need as much
nutrients because you're not using as much
[SPEAKER_01]: water And it's easier to maintain the
water and not over water that plant when
[SPEAKER_01]: it is in a smaller pot So I recommend
graduating up to pot size this listener or
[SPEAKER_01]: viewer asked why not if we're using a
fabric pot why not just Leave that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fabric pot and drop it in the soil
into the next size up My answer is most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the time when you use the word just you
know You're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say why don't you just that is the
lazy way out That is the you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just good enough Why don't you do it the
right way instead of doing it just good
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to get by that is my theory here
and I'm not trying to discredit you or
[SPEAKER_01]: discount you or anything you're asking me
why I don't do it because it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: much healthier and much more effective for
those plants and It's just I don't it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems sort of lazy to just drop that plant
in there I would take it out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabric pot set that pot aside rinse it
scrub it out use it again in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: and then just place that Soil into that
whole plant into your next size up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see I don't see any benefit in
using that original pot Yes, the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow through it, but they're gonna
have to fight to grow through it Don't you
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to grow and expand and fill that
next container and be robust or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to have to fight?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like Packing your soil way too
tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like putting up a gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like saying yeah, there's more soil
over there Good luck fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get to that I would rather just
take that off and let those roots expand
[SPEAKER_01]: freely When I take that first pot off I
actually stick my fingers in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch those roots up and break them up a
little bit to encourage that outward
[SPEAKER_01]: growth So I take off that pot The start of
this is when you when you say just that's
[SPEAKER_01]: always you know, you're doing why don't
you just do it this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just you could just do it the
lazy way or you could just Do it the right
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just stick with the right way
and do what you know is right Set yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: up for success Let those roots grow take
off that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them grow Also, I feel like I assume I
imagine you're going to get especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do multiple layers of this You're
going to get watering issues that fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: pots gonna hold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna start to get algae or mold
building up in that pot I just don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of having that fabric pot buried
under my soil That doesn't it doesn't sit
[SPEAKER_01]: right with me when I could have just taken
it off and done it the right way So,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, yeah encourage the root growth by
taking that off of their recycle the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: by taking that off of there Let them grow
freely by taking it off and avoid watering
[SPEAKER_01]: issues by just taking it out of that pot
Let me read to make sure I got this right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, we got this one right my dude
rhino Thank you for the good mind
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiring question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox because
like I said, you've got a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds at I read direct calm
Let's keep this party moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from Our friend who wants to
be called sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up sticky?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really uh, I mean I know a lot of
people who call themselves sticky in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry Shout out to my new
friend sticky sticky check your inbox
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got a coupon code for a
free pack of seeds from I read direct calm
[SPEAKER_01]: This question says hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the content and the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love making great genetics for the
community that you guys can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully And then it feels like it's
my duty to come help you grow them once I
[SPEAKER_01]: put those out So thank you for noticing it
says I'm having issues with my reservoir
[SPEAKER_01]: staying at the right pH level So this
person has a reservoir that they fill with
[SPEAKER_01]: Water and then probably it sounds like
they're putting their nutrient solution in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they're keeping that nutrient
solution for a period of time It does not
[SPEAKER_01]: indicate that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it keeps fluctuating every time I
go to feed I check and my pH has gone up
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I having to pH my water every two
days?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using okay, they Explain what they're
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped adding silica and that's not
gonna help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you possibly explain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of great Solutions about
your solution here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this person has a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a reservoir They're putting
their nutrients in there so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: feed probably Some sort of a hydroponic
system throughout the week and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: checking that pH every two days Maybe
they're scooping water up I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: they got water and nutrients in a tank
premixed ready to rock and they're saying
[SPEAKER_01]: every two days when they check the pH Has
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first reason is general evaporation
The water is evaporating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know and this is where I have a
question that this one You can just fill
[SPEAKER_01]: in the gaps on your own if you're using
any kind of hydroponic system If this
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir is being pumped to anything and
then being returned or just drained to
[SPEAKER_01]: waste So there's water being pumped out if
it is a returned system some of that water
[SPEAKER_01]: is evaporating some of that Water is being
eaten by the plants or being absorbed and
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up by the plants So the water is
evaporating and being absorbed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants Now what's happening is inside your
reservoir that salt is not evaporating the
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the salts are being eaten by the
plant But you've got some of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: being eaten and evaporation So that
evaporation your water level is going down
[SPEAKER_01]: But the salt level is staying there
because the salts do not evaporate Your
[SPEAKER_01]: total dissolved solids will go up because
there's less water the same amount of salt
[SPEAKER_01]: your ratio is just changing based on that
Little bit of evaporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my assumption My other assumption
is whatever you're using for your pH or pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down is not stable Are you using the
bottled pH up and pH down products?
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell at the store or are you using
something different or are you phing at
[SPEAKER_01]: all?
[SPEAKER_01]: You sounds like you are but my main
assumption Main thing is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporation that water is evaporating over
two two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be losing just very little You
might be losing quite a bit of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your situation But that water
is evaporating the water level is changing
[SPEAKER_01]: and the salts are not evaporating.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're staying right there So that is
what is changing also give it a good stir
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend putting some sort of a
stir pump in that tank at all times Don't
[SPEAKER_01]: aerate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put oxygen in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what I would do I would stir it
just drop like a fish tank pump that's
[SPEAKER_01]: designed to a Fountain pump is what I'm
talking about a pump is just gonna move
[SPEAKER_01]: the water Just suction cup it to the side
blowing off to one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just pulling The water from one side
to the other If you got a reservoir that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a trash can or it'll just stir it around
that way for you Keep that water moving
[SPEAKER_01]: keep those nutrients moving that will help
but I think a lot of it is evaporation
[SPEAKER_01]: also Depending on what nutrients you're
mixing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things may be binding and or
falling out of solution Stirring will help
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, but the binding can't be
prevented with some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why these products are sold in
separate bottles something should not be
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed together because they will
chemically bond to Together they will sink
[SPEAKER_01]: to the bottom that will affect your pH
that will affect everything Those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are slowly changing into other
compounds over time in that solution
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I don't have the organic
chemistry knowledge to tell you exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening there But I think I said
it close enough you guys correct me
[SPEAKER_01]: educate me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid to be educated updated
corrected That's what the comment section
[SPEAKER_01]: is for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I missing something but it could be
evaporation I could because the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: simply eating it it could be because
Chemical bonding is happening inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: this reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what did I write down?
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is being used and evaporating
the salts don't evaporate the EC and the
[SPEAKER_01]: pH will change based on the evaporation
Also, it could be bonding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my story.

questions This one's got a lot of notes
[SPEAKER_01]: written on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from my new friend I'm not
sure how to pronounce your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say I'll say it twice This came
from my friend Hajj or this one came from
[SPEAKER_01]: my new friend Hi, not sure how to say it,
but I hope I got it right one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: times The question oh also do check your
inbox for your free seeds at I read direct
[SPEAKER_01]: dot Com this question says first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do a wonderful show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you I'm having fun on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says very informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro I will I'm on a roll says
now to my questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a natural fade?
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it actually occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't do a flush before chop,
will the plants naturally fade or does the
[SPEAKER_01]: flush aid in?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fading process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking to understand this
amazing plant a little better This is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's talk about what this person
means by a fade When you're growing your
[SPEAKER_01]: ganja plants, you may notice that in the
final weeks right before you cut that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant down Your leaves will begin to
change colors There's a few reasons for
[SPEAKER_01]: this which I will discuss or try to cover
But those leaves change colors That is the
[SPEAKER_01]: fade when it goes from whatever color it
started as was it bright green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it lime green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it dark green where they may be sort
of black?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they fade off and go yellow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they turn a little bit of orange?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get some maroonish colors in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get bright bright yellows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do those black black-leaved plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they start to turn a little bit red on
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the natural fade That is what this
listener and or viewer is asking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the natural fade?
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it actually occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: It occurs at the end and it could be it is
part of senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the plant ending It's part of
maybe the plant ripening which I we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna talk about that in a little bit here
I could be from a lot of different things
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wrote down a big list of things that
could cause the fade Sometimes it will
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it will not happen Sometimes
it's genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a big list of what we'll talk
about but um I'm gonna jump right into my
[SPEAKER_01]: notes It says I don't think that fade is
too important fade doesn't matter to me
[SPEAKER_01]: fade is it's beautiful It's it's colorful
if I want to take really good photographs
[SPEAKER_01]: if I want to get likes on Instagram If I
want a room that looks good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet fade Is beautiful but as a
consumer as a smoker as a grower as
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who has to I touch the plant all
the way through I fucking pop the seed I
[SPEAKER_01]: plant them I grow them I trim them I smoke
them fade doesn't really do a lot other
[SPEAKER_01]: than like I said for the camera fade is
best for Visual that's all it really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will indicate things it can show you
stuff by looking at those leaves you can
[SPEAKER_01]: say Maybe if it's fading early you can say
I'm nitrogen deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta fucking start stepping up my
nutrients If you see something happening
[SPEAKER_01]: too soon that fade can indicate things but
most of the time it's just the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: saying Hey, it's time for me to end and a
lot of times it's saying I am out of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen So if you've been if you're one
of the people that believe in a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: flush, that's controversial to me I don't
flush but if you're a flushing kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: person Then that fade will show you that
your flushing has been effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the fade can mean a lot of
things I'll talk about that but the fade
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't too important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not smoking the leaves that's why the
Fade doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna cut all that faded shit off
whether it's bright green whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dark green whether it's faded yellow
Whether it's purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna trim it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not smoking the leaves I'm gonna smoke
the buds and I'm mainly going for
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes is what we're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we want ripe trichomes That's my next
note or earlier if you're making hash you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to cut it down just a little bit
earlier so the fade has a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: a Lot of people have a lot of different
ideas about the fade the fade could be
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just basically senescence all the
plants outside are fading too Because they
[SPEAKER_01]: know that their time is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows I'm only gonna go for one season
and it's then it's time to go I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: use up all my resources all my energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go once and then at the end I
might put on a good fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can affect your fade the feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been feeding heavily?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been feeding enough you probably
if you've been feeding too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you won't even see a fade possibly Then
like I said before the fade isn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent necessary It happens
sometimes it happened sometimes it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: I've Noticed different times of year based
on the weather my indoor crops may fade
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less than my other crops my summer
crop It gets real hot here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to get the room cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as much colors the crop happening now
It's a little bit colder colorful as all
[SPEAKER_01]: hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So um feed could be a big difference in
your fade If your plants have eaten a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not gonna fade as much They just
might not fade because they're eating
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeding them nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna be bright green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might prevent the fade that way
lighting can change Can affect your fade?
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum intensity distance duration all
of those things can affect your fade if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're Putting super bright LEDs really
close to the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna pale out at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just gonna get more yellow They're
gonna the next thing temperature of the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it cold?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things can affect your fade You'll
notice that colder rooms will get more
[SPEAKER_01]: colorful leaves also swings.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hot is it during the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: How cold is it at night or vice versa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things will Make a difference on the
fade the humidity wet and dry I know it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds wild but that wet and dryness the
VPD in there is going to have an effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: the color of your leaves that is going to
have a huge effect swings swings in
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature humidity and VPD overall will
have a huge effect on the colors and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fade of your plants Here's something you
might not even think about water
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature the water that you're feeding
that plant how warm or how cold is that
[SPEAKER_01]: water temperature if you're feeding those
plants cold temps You're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: colorful leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a protector of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll spit out those anthocyanins It'll
get nice and purple and try to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: itself What about dry backs the opposite
dry backs may also affect your color and
[SPEAKER_01]: or the lack there of your color What about
pot size?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not even think about pot size.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if your plants are root bound?
[SPEAKER_01]: They might start fading earlier if they're
root bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say hey, I'm fucking root bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do I'm just gonna
finish out fuck eating fuck drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am just going to finish out Sometimes
your plants are they're locked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been feeding them way too much
Maybe your pH is off those plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna start fading even more quickly
because they cannot eat So a fade is not
[SPEAKER_01]: always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's saying hey, I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to fix an issue Help me the fuck
out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I have written down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh the most important thing Genetics some
plants just will not fade like if you run
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon Jeffrey it goes from green to yellow
That's all you get just green bright green
[SPEAKER_01]: Then yellow if you run afterglow that big
bitch will go from dark green to light
[SPEAKER_01]: green to light yellow to bright pink to
orange To fucking brown like so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and let's talk about the cream if
you get a cut of the cream That bad bitch
[SPEAKER_01]: will turn black on you toward the end Then
it will start to fade like these reddish
[SPEAKER_01]: cool colors the dark hollow cut going on
It starts a bright green fades to black at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end So it's all about genetics some of
the things the orangegasm doesn't fade a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes bright Green to just yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell you like that bitch is
yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just right at the end yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's done Sometimes you'll get an orange
or a couple of orange colors some bright
[SPEAKER_01]: orange hues out of that orangegasm But
that's a rare one that also comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: pink pistols So if you see those golden
colored leaves look for the pink pistols
[SPEAKER_01]: or pay attention to both of those But a
lot of it is genetics And a lot of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: just how you're feeding the plant and
environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't find a fade to be important It's
really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before I like it for taking
photos and shit But what is a natural fade
[SPEAKER_01]: that is when the plant starts to use up
all of its resources It starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally senesce and it starts to change
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the plants outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an annual plant It's only supposed to
go so many weeks and that plant knows it
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's gonna start fading When does it
naturally occur that is going to be plant
[SPEAKER_01]: specific that can be affected by your
environment and your feed This guy said I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do a flush will the plants naturally
fade?
[SPEAKER_01]: They might Depending on the genetics
depending on what you're feeding they
[SPEAKER_01]: judge Just might if you're overfeeding
something they might not but that is very
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and genetic and phenotype specific
All right, my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I said your name correctly at some
point It's HAJ and I'm not sure how to
[SPEAKER_01]: pronounce that haj.

[SPEAKER_01]: there on the screen once again big thanks
and big shout out to Everybody who does
[SPEAKER_01]: support the podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's ride this good momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another good question here in
front of me This one came from our friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having an easy name to say
this question said hey, man I'm a new
[SPEAKER_01]: listener and I enjoy your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining the show Make sure you
click like and subscribe and don't forget
[SPEAKER_01]: about the patreon server The question says
my question is about revenge clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, this is a popular question This
comes up from time to time it says
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially cuttings that are Taken from a
flowering plant and put under a veg
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is very popular I'd said are
there any downsides to this process
[SPEAKER_01]: process that you know of besides the extra
time that it takes to get these things to
[SPEAKER_01]: revert to fresh leaf growth Are there any
downsides using revenge clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay now many talks about breeding No,
just as long as you let everything grow
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the let the hormones readjust and
get back to normal veg state and get back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the normal leaves and give it some time
there's no Downside to breeding with these
[SPEAKER_01]: let me touch on the question here what
this person wants to do What I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do they've got a plant they've put
this plant into flower But they did not
[SPEAKER_01]: take clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always recommend take a clone from every
plant before you flower it Sometimes that
[SPEAKER_01]: is not an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that we're gonna hit this
water here because my voice is starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: fry out but Um, just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even gonna edit this
[SPEAKER_01]: So my new friend Dan Has a plant and they
want to take clones From a plant that is
[SPEAKER_01]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long into flower it is,
but this practice will work You could do
[SPEAKER_01]: this all the way through flower if you
really want to and it will revedge The
[SPEAKER_01]: further into flower you do this the more
time it will take for that plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: revedge but anything is possible so
They've got a plant it's in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to take clones Cuttings that are
taken from a flowering plant and put under
[SPEAKER_01]: a veg lighting cycle So they're gonna cut
these clones either put it in a dome or
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in an easy cloner and they're going
to Use my cloning SOP that I put up on my
[SPEAKER_01]: discord server and I will talk about that
cloning SOP in the future I want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: over the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe update it then we'll do a full
podcast about it, but that is coming Thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you for the response about that These
clones are called monster clones or
[SPEAKER_01]: monster cropping is what this is known as
When you take a clone from a flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and put that in the cloner that is
called a monster clone or monster cropping
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think that's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've always called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very useful practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very Useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, you could do this at any
point in the flowering phase The earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: the better because the longer you wait the
longer it's going to take to revedge But
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, you can do this Essentially cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any downsides?
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside is that if that clone does
not successfully root and revedge You
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have to revedge the big plant,
which is still possible Depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: long you waited but that is the downside
is that you don't have a safety net if
[SPEAKER_01]: this clone does not Work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the only downside there is
that you're risking not having that
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic preserve So and that's why I take
clones before I put shit into flower I
[SPEAKER_01]: wait till I've got roots and then I flower
it but no no downside there Can there be
[SPEAKER_01]: downsides to using revedge clones to breed
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, as long as you let everything grow out
and let all the the hormones get back to
[SPEAKER_01]: their normal I'll let them adjust to their
growing back in veg and you don't see any
[SPEAKER_01]: signs of flower and then wait Maybe even
one more week then no, there's no downside
[SPEAKER_01]: To this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my friend Dan.
