[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast is dedicated to my friend Brody
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 398 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of Banana Wafer Kush from
our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 74.9% THC with 89.6%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice stony effect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more stony than high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to put me in a nice little bubble,
puts me in my own little space in my head
[SPEAKER_00]: here and I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're taking dabs of the Banana
Wafer Kush from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright podcast world, in this episode I'm
going to read a few listener emails and
[SPEAKER_00]: answer a few questions but before I get
there I want to read a comment that came
[SPEAKER_00]: in on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode I talked about the
Colorado Crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the Colorado Crunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when the herb gets super dry from
being left in the jars all day in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a comment that came from a listener
named DR on YouTube and DR says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add that Boveda packs save
my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would see more dispensaries out
there using them that don't prepackage
[SPEAKER_00]: their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do appreciate the input but I do
also despise Boveda packs or Boveda packs
[SPEAKER_00]: however you say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like them in the jars with the
product at the dispensary on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion those packs leave a funky
aroma and flavor on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that being said if you like the
packs and you like the results that you or
[SPEAKER_00]: your local dispensary are getting by using
those packs don't change anything because
[SPEAKER_00]: of what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me make a suggestion for your
personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method wouldn't be practical in a
dispensary environment but it does work in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would work in your personal grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your buds get too crunchy something I
suggest is grabbing a leaf from a fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a mason jar one leaf will be
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick one fresh leaf inside your mason
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it in there for like 30-45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack it open and see how much it is
moistened up the rest of those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moisture from that one leaf will move
around in those buds very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're using the same plant with the
same bricks level, the same aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not adding anything different into
that jar to make a funky flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are putting the exact same plant in
there with the same aroma, the same
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to mess things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to get away from the
Boveda packs also save yourself a few
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe experiment if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again if you're happy with what you've got
going on don't change anything on my
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you're doing it wrong is if
you kill the plants or if you're not happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with the final outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with your final outcome
and you're satisfied with your product
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing exactly what you're doing but
also keep looking for ways to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right again that came from DR on the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to our friend DR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the show and also
thanks for the great feedback and thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for the great show material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if everybody finds
me on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply go to YouTube and search for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, click
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribe, leave some comments on the
videos and who knows maybe I will read
[SPEAKER_00]: your comments on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right now it is time to start working
through the mountain of emails that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been saving up for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love and appreciate all of the emails
and questions that you guys have sent me
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was tied up in that long series of
grow lessons so I wasn't really paying
[SPEAKER_00]: much attention to the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that that series is done it is time to
start working through these emails so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top of the stack here this one goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking forward to growing for a
long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past year I've loved listening
through your podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finally ready to get started as all of
my equipment was just delivered this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude first of all thanks for listening to
the show and second congratulations on all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the new equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that is super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say I'm going to be
working indoor in a 4x4 Vibosun tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to put four plants in five
gallon buckets under a 1200 watt LED grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to order seeds from your online
store but the selection is so vast that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me jump in and say that I don't
have a website that sells seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a breeder but my seeds are available
on other vendor websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are probably referring to the Hella
Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store or
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly you're shopping on Oregon Elite
Seeds at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of other great vendors
that carry my products but those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: two who I have talked about most on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is probably where you are
shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes I do agree that it can be quite
intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself offer over 20 different seed
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 20 lines available from just
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably 20 or 30 different
vendors available on the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds has got at least a
hundred breeders available on their
[SPEAKER_00]: website so it does get very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get very intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be overwhelming very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I go to a restaurant or
even a dispensary I complain that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are too many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say you should just give me one or two
options and say that's what you're eating
[SPEAKER_00]: and take it and shut up and be happy
because right now it's going to take me 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes to sift through all these options
just to figure out what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a lot to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a lot to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some seed strain descriptions can be
very deceptive and very misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it can be very confusing to a new
grower what all of the X's and parentheses
[SPEAKER_00]: mean when the genetics are listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally agree that it can be
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get ourselves back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you could provide some
suggestions and maybe even some pro tips
[SPEAKER_00]: on growing whichever strain I decide on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let me know if I can provide any
more information about my situation and
[SPEAKER_00]: help narrow down what would work best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be my first grow so I'm not
expecting perfect results but I figure
[SPEAKER_00]: some expert advice could go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to hearing from you and
then they signed it with their name which
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have permission to say on the
show so I'm going to hold that back but
[SPEAKER_00]: hey dude you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start answering a couple of your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think you've got the right idea
with four five gallon pots in this
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that should be just enough
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the plants get too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much ceiling height
you've got in your tent but make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: flower soon enough to where those plants
don't reach up into your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure that you've got plenty of
airflow in that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some way to pull that moist hot
stale air out of the top of that tent and
[SPEAKER_00]: let fresh new cool air come in into the
bottom of the tent so that you can keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants in a healthy environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many new growers overlook the importance
of airflow when they are building a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in a tent so please make sure to have some
way to remove that humidity out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't go out by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need an extraction fan coming out of
the tent to suck that humidity out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there and honestly I don't know much about
that brand of tent and I don't know much
[SPEAKER_00]: about LEDs but it sounds like you're off
to a good start with your grow so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: focus more on the seed aspect of your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting new seeds for your very first
grow can be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend finding a strain that
does not take a really long time to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something around eight weeks would be
ideal for a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is less time to screw up the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a new grower that extra week or two is
a lot more opportunity for things to go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to find something that finishes
around eight or nine weeks would be my
[SPEAKER_00]: first suggestion so as you're scrolling
through and you're looking at flower times
[SPEAKER_00]: if you see that it says it's going to take
nine to ten or ten to eleven weeks I would
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of steer away from that and find
something a little quicker in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else to think about do you want
to grow regular or feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got room for four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the folks that I recommend
feminized seeds to folks with very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: space and not a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those feminized seeds will help you out in
several different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: First you don't have to look for the
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second you don't plant a plant and then
grow it and then flower it and realize
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were phenohunting, if you were that
type of a grower that's when I suggest you
[SPEAKER_00]: get regular seeds but someone in your
situation I may suggest feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you said you were looking for
iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some iry genetics
suggestions that may work well in that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I would recommend that is
not feminized would be prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is flow cross to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flow keeps it kind of short and
stocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows nice and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would work well in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next recommendation would be sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun kiss is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a regular seed but it stays nice and
short and squat and it grows real wide and
[SPEAKER_00]: branchy and I think it would work great in
your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for feminized options I would
recommend the Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again we've got the platinum tangy in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cross to my blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one won't get super tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of resin and it smells and
tastes like oranges and funky candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one I would recommend is the
Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael does take a little bit longer to
finish but it is very quality product and
[SPEAKER_00]: it is very simple to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She won't give you any problems except
she'll get very large buds which for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower will feel very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to learn how to keep those
buds from toppling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to learn how to use stakes or
tomato cages or a trellis or something but
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be a very rewarding experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the Raphael is available
only in feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one I would suggest is Bebop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bebop is easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of trichomes and giant
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again you're going to have to give it some
sort of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bebop will make huge buds early in flower
so it needs sticks or tomato cages or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to keep those big buds from
flopping over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again Bebop is only available in feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next and final suggestion, my strain
specific recommendation will be
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocksteady is another one of my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is feminized and it does produce giant
buds that are covered in resin and they
[SPEAKER_00]: smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are six great options I can
recommend just for my own seed line that I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel would work perfectly in your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does not hurt my feelings at all if
you choose to work with another breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many breeders out there
because we all offer something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Mr. Soul said it's kind of like
bands and music listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy's out there playing one kind of
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy's out there playing another kind
of music.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are naturally going to walk to the
kind of music that draws them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take it personally if you prefer
another seed company over me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the world is supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to buy seeds from
another breeder I highly suggest you get
[SPEAKER_00]: something from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that you have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who has been around for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who has a positive online
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go check out their online their
social media presence and see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out their customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely suggest you do research
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the breeder before you purchase seeds
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also buy from a reputable vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed vendors available
online right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what they're going to send you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows when they're going to send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best to do your research on the
seed company and the seed vendor you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to spend your money with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet is a black hole of scam
artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are plenty of people out there
just trying to take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your research before you give
anybody your credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several reputable reliable
honest seed vendors out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to list a few that I work with
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with Southern Oregon Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with the Seed Bazaar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work with Gringo Beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give all of them a five star rating
and a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Oregon Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Seed Bazaar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gringo Beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are five reliable seed vendors that
I can confidently recommend to my
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have made a few suggestions on
seeds from my lines that would work
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recommended that you buy from a
reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also suggested that you buy from
a reputable vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about the most important
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is the consumer
and what that consumer enjoys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that you are the
person that is going to be smoking most of
[SPEAKER_00]: this finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you like to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like gassy smells?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like fruity smells?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like oranges?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like strawberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like just weird funkiness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what type of aromas and
flavors you enjoy when you smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you smoked something in the past
that really stood out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of flavors did that have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what strain that was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can find that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can find a phenotype that really
represents what you had in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have that around for your
own personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really all about what you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point in the cannabis
evolution or revolution, you can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: find something to fit your palate exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were into garlic mashed potatoes
and onions, there is a strain that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were into oranges covered in sugar
with a little bit of cherry juice dusted
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, there is a strain that smells and
tastes like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just got to check the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to kind of find what works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing I would think about,
what type of effect are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that racing head buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need a big sativa high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you need that chilled out indica,
put you in the couch, watch some cartoon
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you desire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you consuming for a medicinal effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you consuming just because you're a
pothead?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not judging you either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes a difference in your
selection and what you're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what are you going to do with the
final product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to smoke it in flower form?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to press it into rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to make bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to make some type of BHO or
hydrocarbon extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another thing to keep in mind when
you are planning your seed selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my guidance on selecting seeds
for your very first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also say, I was hoping you could
provide some suggestions and maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: some pro tips on growing, whichever strain
I decide on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, when you make your selection,
let me know what you decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will send you all of the tips and
tricks I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you some cheat codes and we can
get your garden booming on your very first
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also go on to say, please let me know
if I can provide any more information
[SPEAKER_00]: about my situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it sounds like you did a pretty good
job explaining what you've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made it clear the size of your
environment and the amount and size of
[SPEAKER_00]: pots you're going to put in there and the
amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you've got some airflow in
there, I think you'll be doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend some carbon
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, it sounds like you
are off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last line of your message says that
it's going to be your first grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're not expecting perfect results,
but you know that some expert advice will
[SPEAKER_00]: go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, expect perfect results, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strive for perfection in your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do have some expert advice for you
that will help your first grow be perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do pay close attention to details.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first piece of advice is to buy a grow
book from a reputable grow author,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis expert, somebody who has done
this repeatedly, for years and has the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge to put it into a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy one or two books, then read those
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: The books are no good if you buy them and
set them by the toilet and it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cool because you have those books.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look cool because you have them,
but they don't do shit for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the knowledge that is in
that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you've got the knowledge
that's in that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I ask you a question and you
haven't read the book, you don't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge just by sitting it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope that in the future we can buy
USB thumb drives and you can just pop them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the little USB port right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right behind your ear and your neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can upload all of the
information from that book into your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to buy the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to open it and you have to read
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So read a couple of reputable grow books.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next piece of expert advice would be to
go back to episode 351 and start listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to the grow series from episode 351 and
catch all of the grow lessons that take
[SPEAKER_00]: you from the very beginning of the grow
all the way through harvest, all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through cleaning up, all the way through
smoking your finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go back and listen to all of the grow
lessons and I feel like you will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good head start on your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not the type of person that
will go back and pick out the grow lesson
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes, that's okay because I plan to do
compilations of all of the lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted consecutively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is I'm going to
find the first grow lesson, the second
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lesson, the third grow lesson,
and I will put just the lessons in order
[SPEAKER_00]: in a long episode in about three hour
chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however many episodes will fit in a
three hour chunk, that's how many will go
[SPEAKER_00]: in episode 401.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next group of lessons will go
in 402.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do that until we get
through that entire grow series.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way all of the lessons are out there
uninterrupted without those random
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes, me and Mike talking and me
talking about random shit in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I plan to put it all out in a
consecutive chunk without interruptions in
[SPEAKER_00]: the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to thank you once again
for that email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to hearing from you
when you make your IRI genetics selection
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get that garden started.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to jump right into
the next email and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, I've been growing at home for
a little over two years and have grown
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 15 plants with results
varying from average to probably below
[SPEAKER_00]: average results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey ma, first of all, I'm proud of you for
being able to admit that you had below
[SPEAKER_00]: average or average results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers think that their first
product is the most amazing shit that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever grown and they've got an ego
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were already doing better than a
lot of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, All of my plants
have been healthy looking and grow well in
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used a variety of nutrients with
none of them appearing to be some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no magic bullet when it comes to
plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that go into
keeping a plant happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients are a very small part of that
pie and no nutrient bottle or nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: company is a magic solution or a magic
bullet like you've said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, I am currently
experimenting with the CNS 17 line from
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare in deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course that CNS stands for
commercial nutrient system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should work great in the deep water
culture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I use recharge, CalMag and a
bloom booster in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I can read plants relatively
well, but I find myself unsure as to the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity of nutrients to provide through
plants different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically I find myself doing a sort of
ramp up at a rate of about 200 PPMs per
[SPEAKER_00]: week from week one after seed sprout until
I hit 1200 ish PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is typically where I usually
plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a little nervous to go too high too
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me any tips on how to do a
better job of pushing my plants or how you
[SPEAKER_00]: go about determining how much is just
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: On another note, you have hands down the
best podcast for cannabis information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out there, the sound quality information
and care you take is definitely noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also not a man crush thing, but you have a
great radio voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could fall asleep to that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to run a batch of a rise when
hella dank has them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other note about the best
podcast, dude, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no competition, but when you were
told you're the best, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will always put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound quality is truly important to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a sound nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great sound equipment,
so I appreciate you noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing the information and
care I take are definitely important to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put out accurate information that
is useful and gives you some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and improves your life some way,
give you some sort of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure I put that in each show and
the care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I do grow from my heart,
drum from my heart, podcast from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing the radio voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I hear that a lot, so it is not
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stand my own voice in these
headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I listen back to edit the show,
I'm like, who is that asshole rambling?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the compliment on the
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could fall asleep to that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably give people weird dreams if you
fell asleep to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine what kind of dreams you
would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you wrap up with can't wait to run a
batch of a rise when they're back in
[SPEAKER_00]: stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are back in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check them out before they run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have five packs and 10 packs
available at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus on the nutrient part of
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got all the right
tools in your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the Botanicare commercial
nutrient system lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some recharge in there to give
yourself a root boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got CalMag because of course high
performance plants will get a CalMag
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency and a bloom booster later in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got all of the right
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the right idea for the ramp up.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you could go a little bit higher
later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that Botanicare lineup and those
additives, you could probably push to the
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 or 1600 ppm range and not cause any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you could probably go a little
bit higher if you do not double up on any
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know how much nitrogen is in
each product and you know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus is in each product and you can
balance it out to where you don't overdose
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, you can probably go pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some variables I would like to
know before I give too much advice about
[SPEAKER_00]: this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as, is there CO2 running?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of lighting are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to know about your environment
and your overall setup because that would
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me where we can improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have CO2, you can probably run
a little higher ppms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got stronger lighting,
the plants can handle higher ppms because
[SPEAKER_00]: they have enough light energy to
metabolize those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got low quality lighting,
you can't feed as strongly because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not metabolizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got powerful lighting,
lights and CO2, you can feed the shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them and you may not see any burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed that same feed regimen to a
plant that you're not augmenting CO2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're running it under a fluorescent,
it's going to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with so many variables, I have to be
careful with my advice and my suggestions
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the right idea starting low
and working your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you thought about working your way up
until you burn the shit out of one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that is how I find my plants
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I increase the ppms until I see I call it
getting their nails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the plant leaf looking like a
hand and when you see the tips starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get yellow or starting to get funky
colors, they're getting their nails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see one of the ladies
starting to get her nails done,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you have pushed it right to the
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either continue to go that hard
and they'll just keep burning just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and you probably won't see it
in the final product because you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to trim off all of that leaf honestly and
you're going to flush it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can push it a little bit if you
know what you're doing with each nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say that you've got a good eye on
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this may be where you're
headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you start pushing, you've got to
decide, do I want to keep pushing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: see how this burn progresses or do I want
to stop right where I am and keep giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it that or do I want to dial back and
prevent more burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you have to think about it as
a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you have to make the
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the move at this time is to
increase the ppms later in flower and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how much they can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push it until you burn them and see if you
come out with a better harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already not satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what could go wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be less satisfied if you
do some experimentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may do an experiment and you may
improve your garden dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to keep in mind is
could this be a genetic issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you simply have weak genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making fun of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not calling you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that this is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic potential may be your limiting
factor at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, I don't know about your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about your lights,
your air, your water, your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about your personal attention
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that could be limiting you
is the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your email starts off by saying that
you've grown approximately 15 plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really don't know if that was the
same plant 15 times or if you've grown 15
[SPEAKER_00]: different seeds or 15 different cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe genetics are what are holding
you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you've got the right
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start pushing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push them a little bit harder and watch
for nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you do see a little bit of nutrient
burn, that's when you need to decide,
[SPEAKER_00]: do I want to dial it back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to keep going or do I want to go
a little bit stronger?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if your plants are in
individual buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got one main
reservoir feeding each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're in individual buckets,
why not test each plant differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many plants you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've only got one, so you've only
got one option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got multiple plants,
why not try one with your 1200 max PPMs
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're used to and mark that plant,
the one getting fed low PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mark the other plant, the one getting
fed medium PPMs and go to 14 with that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take another one and hit it at 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get another one and feed it all the
way up to 18 and feed another one all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up to 20 and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will definitely show you
nitrogen toxicity or some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see some sort of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know what those plants can
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's how I became an advanced
skill level grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked a lot of things up just by
experimenting and trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that your plants are
precious to you and that every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: counts and that you need that harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to take your grow to the
next level, you may have to take some
[SPEAKER_00]: risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may cost you one or two plants,
but that experience is invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can take your crop from,
what did you say, average to probably
[SPEAKER_00]: below average to above average,
and fucking stellar, it may be worth
[SPEAKER_00]: killing two or three, maybe four or five
plants just to see what they can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing I want to talk about is
you said you were using the Botanicare CNS
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to open the Botanicare website
and I'm going to open the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a nutrient calculator right here
on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows me to punch in what type
of base nutrients we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use the CNS 17 bloom base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to measure our product in
milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to type in that we have a one
gallon reservoir just to keep this simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants grow time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say we're going to grow for
four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will bloom for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a hypothetical for the case
of this podcast so I can give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: advice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the Botanicare website,
on their official nutrient calculator,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bloom phase for week one of flower,
it is recommending that I use 13
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of the CNS 17 bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to put my PPMs at 910.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next week, they increase that
dosage to 17 milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that continues all the way through
week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I correctly add 17 milliliters of
CNS 17 bloom base nutrients to my water,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to this feed chart, that is
going to bring my PPMs to 1119.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is very close to the 1200 number
that you said you were ramping up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Botanicare is recommending you start
week two at 10 PPMs below where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: maxing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this chart on this website is telling
us that your PPMs of your base nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are way low and you need to increase your
nutrient feedings of your plants earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do preach that these nutrient
companies suggest you use more product
[SPEAKER_00]: than necessary so that they can sell you
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they wouldn't suggest enough to
blatantly burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's push it according to their chart
and see how the plants react on their
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't doubt your skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make this really simple for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to achieve that specific PPM test
in your nutrients is to start with clean
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water with zero PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got city tap water, there's
going to be something in there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down your baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where you're starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have your amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably five gallons, maybe more
depending on your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your PPM meter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour in that base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the meter says.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't say 1190, pour in a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to get that PPMs to 1190.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got your base nutrient at the
correct PPMs, then add your additives at
[SPEAKER_00]: the recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest you check the PPMs after
you add each additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your base nutrient in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to add next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So measure out your two milliliters per
gallon of CalMag and pour it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put your PPM pin back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a swirl and write down what the
PPMs are at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know how many PPMs of CalMag are
in your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the number that appears on your PPM
meter and subtract 1190 because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: how much base nutrient we added.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining math is how much CalMag is
in your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue this with all of your additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention over the next few days and
see how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants look angry, we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to reduce the nutrients,
but now we know what they can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants explode with vigorous
growth, we know we're on the right path to
[SPEAKER_00]: fixing your dissatisfaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't already, I suggest you
head over to the Botanicare website and
[SPEAKER_00]: check out their nutrient calculator and
play around with it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in the CNS 17 base and then see what
it suggests you feed at each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then add a few things to the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can afford a new product,
I would recommend the Liquid Karma as the
[SPEAKER_00]: next thing you add to that lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that to your feed chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how much of it to mix in and add that
right to your lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will improve the quality of your
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, if you're not using
Botanicare, most of the major nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: companies will have a nutrient calculator
on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these companies do want us to buy
more than necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may tell us to use a little bit
extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow the same advice that I gave our
friend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start low, start with maybe 50 or 75% of
the recommended dosage off the website,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then work your way up to 100% if you
feel like the plants can take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I like those nutrient
calculators is because it shows you the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown of what you can be feeding your
garden and it shows you correct ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not want to use every product on
that chart, but it kind of gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio and shows you if you use this much
of the base, let's just say if you use two
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the base, you may want to use one
part of this bloom booster and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter part of this root inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just give you good ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may suggest things you were missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it is a good baseline
recipe for a new grower who is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit overwhelmed and confused by starting a
brand new nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I hope that helps you improve the
quality of your finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to burn a couple of plants
for the sake of overall improvement.
