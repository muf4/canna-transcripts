[SPEAKER_00]: Happy holidays podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 823 of the grow from your
heart podcast I've got a great episode
[SPEAKER_00]: lined up for us in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
on in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that iredirect.com
is back online.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out iredirect.com for
a restock and fresh drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently added chemical cocktail and mac
one to arise to iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also updated all of the freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out the freebie list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a pack of candylicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get 4k.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get chemical cocktail and more
freebies available at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that covers all of the
advertising and news here at the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into one of my favorite parts
of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the section I call pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to grows, when I'm in my own
grow and I'm at a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes when I'm in a social situation,
smoking or talking about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things will trigger a pet peeve
in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been sharing those pet peeves on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to send me your pet
peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what drives you crazy and your
grow somebody else's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a grow and you see something,
what just makes you cringe?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your garden pet peeve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send those pet peeves to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website is iredigenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that website, there is a list of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to that grow help tab,
you can send me grow questions or there
[SPEAKER_00]: you can also send me your grow pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I discuss your pet peeve here on the
podcast, I will give you a gift
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate for a free pack of seeds at
iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's pet peeve came from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's getting free prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's getting seats today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you saw that spit, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today's pet peeve comes from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pet peeve is unlabeled pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, don't plant a bunch of seeds,
plant a bunch of clones and think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to remember what is in each and
every pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely, you were stoned as shit when
you were popping those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely, you were stoned as shit when
you were cutting those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were probably most likely high as
giraffe pussy when you were putting those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones into soil, putting those seeds into
dirt, whatever you did and you did not
[SPEAKER_00]: label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, we're not going to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cannabis growers and cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis makes you kind of forget some
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to put some pots,
some plants in some pots, have some plants
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, label them so we know what they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come back and have to guess is this
one bubble goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this one nuketown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this one strawberry starburst?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put some labels on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label each one carefully and maybe
possibly label each plant more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I heard somebody say they did
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They labeled their plants and then all of
the labels got washed off of the tags when
[SPEAKER_00]: they watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used a non waterproof marker,
so make sure you use the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you need to get some duct tape,
write the strain name on the duct tape,
[SPEAKER_00]: stick that duct tape on the pot,
spin the pot around 180 degrees and do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write the strain name on that duct tape,
stick the duct tape on the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can double down in case one
gets washed off, one gets fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got two labels on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success is what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing drives me more crazy than not
knowing what strain we just grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I send you multiple packs of seeds
and you say this could be this one or this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the breeder, as the person that's going
to post those pictures, none of those
[SPEAKER_00]: photos are valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't use it if it's an I think sort of
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know this is the strain that I
took the photo of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what's in that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my pet peeve of the day, ladies and
gentlemen, is label your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label your clones, your cloner especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of cloners that you'll take a
piece of paper and you'll write like a
[SPEAKER_00]: legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like clone number one, excuse me,
clone number one is a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone number two is blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone number three is strawberry
starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your legend, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for clearing the throat there on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your legend one, two and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens if you turn the paper or
turn the cloner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still remember which one was where?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds silly, but I've seen it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, ladies and gentlemen, let's label
our plants much more carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, I encourage you to send me your
pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what drives you crazy in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do read your pet peeve here on the
show, you win free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's move into the more
popular portion of today's podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the question and answer section
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that website I spoke about a moment
ago, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that website, there's that grow help
tab right at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will send you to a section where you
can send me a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may ask you about your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the VPT?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom, we basically ask
what's going on, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we give you the opportunity
to tell me what's going on in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will try to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use that grow help tab and I read
your question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You won a coupon code for a free pack of
iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first winner came from my friend
Hunter Gatherer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I did not even realize this was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge supporter on Cannabuzz,
a huge social media follower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, thank you for all of the continued
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Words of encouragement, the great
comments, all the following and stalking
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media does count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized who this one came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Hunter Gatherer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, you have won a coupon code for
a free pack of iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
you will have that coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have it yet, make sure you
check your spam.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do miss those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do find those coupon codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, thanks for all
of the growers love over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bro, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much reciprocated love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support and the love back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says by offering ire solid genetics at
affordable prices and the knowledge you've
[SPEAKER_00]: passed to this community over the years,
I have upped my medical grow immeasurably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by knowing that I'm offering seeds at
an affordable price and giving free
[SPEAKER_00]: information, and that's improving your
grow, that makes it worth my time and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, why are the descriptions for your
strains no longer found on your websites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your descriptions were excellent and
informed my purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you please bring them back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers love from Hunter Gatherer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do understand that for a while all
of the descriptions on iregenetics.com
[SPEAKER_00]: were gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the descriptions on iREDirect are
very vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll touch iREDirect first.
[SPEAKER_00]: On iREDirect, if you want to take a credit
card and process money, the credit card
[SPEAKER_00]: processors do not want a lot of
information and details about your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can basically put is a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot put a flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot put any details about growing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the name and the cross, how many
seeds are in the package is basically what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Wave allows me to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wave, the credit card processing company
that I use, they have a very strict
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance guideline, and every product I
put up on my website on iREDirect is
[SPEAKER_00]: scanned by their compliance team,
and it has to meet a certain criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say the wrong words, put the wrong
details, they will not even allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: product to appear on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may take Wave off for a certain time
if I mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very careful about what I put on
iREDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because the credit card processors
do not want a lot of details up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sales being done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no credit card processor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I remove those descriptions for a
short time?
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, I can announce that the
descriptions, the genetics page,
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain descriptions are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more vague than they
were, but they are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to change some of the descriptions
and some of the wording, mainly for legal
[SPEAKER_00]: and technical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning that you can't say,
I can't say things like, golden goat is
[SPEAKER_00]: good for headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, that is a false medical
claim, so I had to reword many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things were geared at potency and
false medical claims, and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: brag about potency at this time on the
website, and I also cannot make medical
[SPEAKER_00]: claims of any sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is how it makes me
feel when I consume it, but I can't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you how it will make you or other people
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you a testimony, but I can't
make a medical claim or any sort of claims
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can't validate in a scientific
manner, and I probably could validate a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of those claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get 50 people in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could smoke a joint and say,
yeah, I do feel like I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could all agree on that, but I don't
want to go through all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier just to not say shit than it
is to explain why you said some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to remove some stuff off the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to talk much more about this on
a Patreon episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be careful about what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you understand that, but I'm
going to do a Patreon episode that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: available to patrons in the month of
December.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably record that right when I
wrap up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for a more detailed episode in the
month of December on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep it affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a slight paywall,
but it will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check patreon.com forward slash grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the month of December, it will be
available there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the description's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can announce now that those descriptions
are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the descriptions are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edited each and every one of those
descriptions by myself individually one at
[SPEAKER_00]: a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all my thought process,
my experiences with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all in those descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it is minimal and slightly
vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do that for a few reasons that
I won't discuss here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may talk more about that on the Patreon
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, those descriptions may evolve
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older descriptions are saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just delete it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highly detailed descriptions are
saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are documented somewhere else,
so they can be replicated in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those are all over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to seedfinder.eu, you can find a
lot of those old descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other websites that document
cannabis have those descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, we got a little bit of notice and
those things got posted in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of those live on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need strange details that we cannot
put on the website on iREADirect or
[SPEAKER_00]: ireagenetics.com, check out my Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to the Discord server in
the show notes and in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord can be... it's a lot to navigate
if you're new, but just come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will guide you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody in there will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff on the left, that's all of
the different tabs you can open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each tab has different stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tabs on the bottom will have strain
names on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find Blueberry Butcher,
every strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to think of random
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat, Arise, they're all on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on it and you can... we
share our grow experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other people that have grown it have
posted photos all the way from seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to harvest and their
experience with each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, I'm on Discord much
more than I should admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come to Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Smoker's Lounge chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably logged into the Smoker's
Lounge chat on my phone right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I'm not in there, I'm just
muted and they're in there chatting right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody in there will be more than happy
to help you with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not there, I probably am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be more than happy to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to the Smoker's Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the info that we cannot put
on the main website, on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: websites, on the main internet is hidden,
is on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lives there freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back to the main part of the
question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where and why they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are back, but they are vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will improve and grow over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if there's a strain that is not
listed and you discover that something you
[SPEAKER_00]: have experienced is not on the website,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send it to
growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: add that strain that I have forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put about 120, 130 strains up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have easily overlooked or forgotten
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to include all of the males,
all of the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asked this question several
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just not ready to address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to address things when I have good
news, when I have a resolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now I publicly address them anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've publicly addressed it because I
have fixed the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I redirect his back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions on higher genetics is
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all back and happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send out a newsletter, letting
everybody know that the descriptions were
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you probably got that newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not get that newsletter,
go to my website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom, there's a little envelope
looking thing with a blank space to type
[SPEAKER_00]: in your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says stay up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type in your email address,
click the enter mark or hit send or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will add you to my mailing list.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put out new drops on direct when I
make updates to the website, I try not to
[SPEAKER_00]: spam you too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going a little bit hard,
but I promise I'll settle down on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: emails once the new year begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But join the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stay up to date to all the fresh
drops, all the updates on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some events coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some secret passwords you may
need things like that at iregenetics.com
[SPEAKER_00]: on the stay up to date tab down on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude hunter gatherer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out the website because
everything you're looking for is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check your email because you've got
to give certificate for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move into the next
message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody that wants to
be called is that L S T I G.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to L S T I G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I've got your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check your email and your
spam for a gift certificate for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question from L S T I G goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what up Ross to Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you and the rest of the iry
army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, big up to the entire iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I hope you had an amazing
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Thanksgiving was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has been beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question is one about water for
your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says is it okay to use spring water
from local natural spring to water my
[SPEAKER_00]: girls?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know not to buy store bought spring
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says what would the shelf like be
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the shelf life, but I've got
a good answer for the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best way to store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other pros or cons you could send my
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care and best catch you in the
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend for hanging out in
the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably be there after I record this
and a patreon episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go hang out in discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's answer the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is can this listener use
spring water in their garden natural
[SPEAKER_00]: spring water?
[SPEAKER_00]: My first instinct without any education,
without any research, without being the
[SPEAKER_00]: water guy, I would say yes, you should
probably use that spring water in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This water does not have any added
chemicals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's put any chlorine, no chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not putting fluoride in this
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably recommend this water for
drinking, for watering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably a highly valuable water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's going to have natural minerals
and probably trace elements of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably really high quality water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would probably recommend watering
your plants with this spring water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would think about is maybe get
it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have water tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact your local water company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably contact the local
department of ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them can steer you in the right
direction to get your water tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you if it's safe to drink,
if it's safe for plants, and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a little quick test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably affordable depending on
where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it tested just for peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the vegetation and everything
around that spring is healthy and happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that water is probably super great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have sulfur in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have other things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would bet that that water is great
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here comes the hippie in me,
the person that has to speak up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said natural spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local natural spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much water is coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a heavily flowing
natural spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a light flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't take more than what you deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin the spring by drying it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of how much water you're taking
from that natural resource there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave no trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other than that, bro,
do your thing with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those plants super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take a sip of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several springs around me in a
place called Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them you can drink from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them they suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to, but they suggest you
don't drink from it because of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may check on that with these plants
or with this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But check the vegetation all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give it a test water or maybe
actually pay for a water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, that spring water is
going to be highly valuable water for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, L S T I G,
thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, check your email because you
have a coupon for a free pack of iry
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics premium seeds on iry direct dot
com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're gonna keep this momentum
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the grow help tab
on iry genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do get a coupon code for a free
pack of iry seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my new friend Dallas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dallas said I'm a huge fan here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for being a fan,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I love the show and I've watched
tons of older episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost embarrassing, but I do
appreciate it says I know you've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this before, but I cannot find the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 820 something now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is I've been hunting through some
seeds and I've grown this cultivar four
[SPEAKER_00]: times and it has stretched each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I've grown it, I've upgraded to
a taller tent from four to six and now an
[SPEAKER_00]: eight footer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I top it and send it into flower at three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the better I grow,
the harder it is to grow small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that kind of makes sense
because you're feeding them better,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking better care, they're getting bigger
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we should also learn how to control
these plants with each grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've upgraded to a great AC
infinity light, but the stretch never
[SPEAKER_00]: stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my stuff is stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're growing,
but a lot of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit I am guilty of producing
stretchy plants early in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we could talk about how to mitigate
this just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is how can I slow it slow the
bolt or just keep it in check?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry that was long winded, but I would
love to hear back bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody ever should apologize for being
long winded when speaking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say more words in one sentence,
more words and more one breath than most
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking fast over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of shit to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my own show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel bad about being long winded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things we can do to mitigate the
stretch of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing I think you're doing it
right is flip early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are afraid to grow my plants
because they take 70 maybe 77 days to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, but then I tell them you can cut
two weeks off your veg time because my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grow so quickly and so vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still growing a nine week plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it takes 11, just flip it a little
bit early because they are so vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my plants do grow tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do grow fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I do suggest to help mitigate
that stretchy phase is top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get a bunch of tops
that are going to grow out of control,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So top it flip early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the first things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things to think about popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys pop and twist your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this on previous
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to do a refresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use a pen as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a branch on a plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This pen right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branch is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this on every branch, so the soil is
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant comes up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grab about here with this hand and
about here with this hand and twist
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite directions until it does a little
bit of a pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the thickness of your stock,
the branch, it'll be a louder or more
[SPEAKER_00]: quiet pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are twisty, some are woody,
some are rubbery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will react differently,
but a lot of times you'll hear a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if my knuckle will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear a little just like that crunch
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a little knuckle pop in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop its knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is coming out of the dirt
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the stick coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grab with my right hand here just
because I'm right handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I prefer to to grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easiest for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab it right above with the left hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear that cellulose
structure of the plant pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is you're going to
create a little a little knuckle there,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little burr.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a little stronger spot in
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go up a couple of inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to go up a few inches and
do it again and then go up again and do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do that to the entire
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start at the bottom and work
my way up the main stock all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to go to the bottom
branches and work my way up all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the lowers and work my way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every branch is going to get popped and
twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popped it and twisted, popped and twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every branch is going to get a nice pop
and twist a nice knuckle cracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then wherever I pop those knuckles,
it's going to get a little bit thicker
[SPEAKER_00]: just like in your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my finger are swollen at my
knuckle and they're going to get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: burr there a little bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get more support.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those branches will become more robust and
tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to support the big fat
buds that are coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also this is going to slow down the
stretch of that plant because it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend a lot of its energy healing up
that broken cellulose structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fibers of the plant we just broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really ruin anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't damage anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just broke it enough to slow down that
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that in the first two and a half
weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is just adjusting its hormones
into the flowering phase at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we're done popping and
twisting everything and that stretch phase
[SPEAKER_00]: is over, it's not even going really into
flower yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers aren't going to happen till
about day 21, 24 is when you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get buds developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and pop them, twist them,
crack them, manipulate them all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: until you start seeing buds set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even go a little further if you
want, but that will slow down that growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will make the plants a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stay squattier and more bushy and
more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stay a little lower and you're not
even messing up the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll slow down that stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pop them, twist them, top them,
put them under a trellis is something else
[SPEAKER_00]: you can also do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them under a net they can't go
much higher because they're under that
[SPEAKER_00]: net.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an art form to learn how to trellis
plants properly, but do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to learn it is to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main idea is to get them to grow
out instead of up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not dealing with one big giant
victory bud, one glory cola that's
[SPEAKER_00]: touching the light and messing everything
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got everything bent down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all growing evenly and everything
gets that nice even light canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flower early, top them, pop and twist
them, trellis them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also feeding them properly can also help
mitigate that stretch in some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand this is only going to be strain
dependent and this will only do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you give them, if you reduce that
nitrogen, give them phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help mitigate that stretchiness
in the start of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to take off for about
the first, you'll see it take off about
[SPEAKER_00]: day 10 and it won't stop until about day
21, 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to go crazy in the
stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get past that, it's slow gradual
growth until the end if it really explodes
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of week nine or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can manage that super turbo
growth for the first three weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to manage the next six
weeks of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't grow as quickly and rapidly
once you get past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it puberty, that puberty stretchy
phase there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going from young girls to ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to stretch and be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what they're really doing is
they're stretching to get up top so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you notice if you grow a male
plant, he grows taller more quickly than
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody so he can get up high and when
he pollinates that pollen can fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girls are trying to get up above the
other girls so they can get that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be the one to get that
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis' whole purpose, the whole purpose
of that plant, we think it's to get us
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that plant's whole purpose is to
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to make seeds for next year so
that it can make seeds for next year and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when you're working
with cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its whole goal is to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's to get us high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend Dallas, thank you for
