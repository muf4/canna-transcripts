[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 832 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got a great episode lined
up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
on in the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to invite you to the Dude Grows
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: June 1st in La Porte, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dude Grows crew is throwing the Dude
Grows Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all
the info on the Dude Grows Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're talking about the Dude Grows
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to remind you that I did restock
the iRi Genetics iRi Army GI Joe logo
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt trying to get these on the camera
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to move my dreadlocks got to move
the mic out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these t-shirts the shirt I am wearing
these have been restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my website iRiGenetics.com
there's a tab up at the top it says merch
[SPEAKER_01]: click on that tab that will take you to a
store where you can get all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: shirts there are hats there are rolling
trays there are dab mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of great merch up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go grab one of the new iRi Army shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool part is if you wear iRi Genetics
or iRi Army merchandise to the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give you a free prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you stop by the booth and say
hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me your iRi Army gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hook you up with the free prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say hi even if you don't have iRi
gear or iRi merch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come pick it up at the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right I think I covered all of the
business here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I want to talk about is
daylight savings time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you manage daylight savings time
in your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us here in North America just had
to move our clock one hour forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means your grow room came on one
hour later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means it stayed on one hour later
than it did the day before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that mess up your schedule?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that freak you out a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know in the comments section how
did you adjust to daylight savings time?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few options of how you could
adjust to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could simply let it ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that plant schedule do its thing and
then you adjust your life around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just move things around one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people they will adjust that
light in the flowering room and the light
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just adjust that timer one hour to make it
fit their schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it actually work with the real
clock at the time that it was on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that a bit abrupt to a flower room
but many people will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other option of course is to
unplug that light and leave it unplugged
[SPEAKER_01]: for would it be 25 hours or 23 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been 25 hours and then plug
it in at the next round of normal time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the three main options that I
think of to get you back on schedule for
[SPEAKER_01]: daylight savings time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you did in the comment
section here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're watching on YouTube type a
comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how you adjusted your grow
room and your life to daylight savings
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're here in the North America region
where we just switched our clocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright that was the first thing I wanted
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I want to talk about is a
question that I have been receiving quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what made this strain real
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why people wanted to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course I'm talking about a strain
that I bred a while back called double
[SPEAKER_01]: Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna talk very briefly about double
Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already getting a smile on my face
because double Paula is very elusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna talk briefly about double
Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is double Paula?
[SPEAKER_01]: Double Paula is a very beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred double Paula in approximately I
want to say circa 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could have been that time frame when I
bred that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made that one around 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018 is about when I think I made that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double Paula is known for making gigantic
yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big old fatty buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buds the size of my arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got skinny arms but they're long so it
makes big long arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have said my legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: My legs are better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes big giant buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big giant yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will make a large variety of candy and
fruity turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like watermelon in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like apricot flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you say apricot or apricot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Argue about that in the comments as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that turp is hidden in there a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got candy flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all kinds of fruity candy
deliciousness flavors that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those big giant buds that I talked about
at making are bright fluorescent green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes most of the time makes really bright
fluorescent green flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there are some phenotypes that
will be the complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a really dark color with a
golden leaf curl.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end that's double Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the phenotypes take about 65 to 72
days to finish on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let that one finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're gonna have big gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The calyx to leaf ratio is very nice on
the double Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole bunch of leaf on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes big giant buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really easy for bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice for the trim crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big heavy colas is the next note that I
wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wrote down also heavy feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also it's gonna get tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to exaggerate that these plants do
get tall and they eat a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah like I said before double Paula is
shrouded in mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still kind of is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most I'm gonna tell you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are asking about
double Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly that's all the info I'm gonna
give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double Paula is kind of a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I just stuttered when I
talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But double Paula is kind of a secret in my
arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you so many details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double Paula will be a secret as long as I
can keep it a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be one other person out there
that knows the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they have ever told
anybody what double Paula really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my story with double Paula and
I'm sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's segue into another section of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the pet peeve section of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know what a pet peeve is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that just drives you freaking
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that grinds your gears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that is cringe-worthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different words for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll be looking on the internet
and I'll see something in somebody's grow
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and I'll go ew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sometimes I'll walk into a grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: A commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A private grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll go aw man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just something that simply drives me crazy
in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to send me your pet
peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something just drives you freaking
crazy in a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work at a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see it in a private grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be also in the grow or the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be something that happens in a
smoke circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does somebody do something that drives you
crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a weird rule or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: A weird community or cultural thing that
just pisses you off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your pet peeve here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds on ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first pet peeve comes from somebody
named Red Eyed Rick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually found this one on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for the grovely throat,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been taking dabs today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Eyed Rick said the number one cause of
house fires is the extension cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was told to me by my residential
electrical teacher and fire chief in trade
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, they did not send me this as a pet
peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is one of my pet peeves is going
into a grow and seeing that spider web of
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical cords, of power cords,
of power strips everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that shit, just like our friend
just said, is the number one cause of
[SPEAKER_01]: house fires is the extension cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're the grower that's got all the
extension cords all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my friends, yeah, I'm talking to
you, bro, be careful because that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: cause for fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather you not use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the electricity figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand some of you guys are going to
do what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't promote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to do it, use the
best, highest grade power, electric cords,
[SPEAKER_01]: power cords.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension cords you can get the highest
grade, best quality you can get and go
[SPEAKER_01]: feel them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure they're not getting too hot and
pay attention to how many amps you're
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling from that wall socket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you've got an older house,
that wiring in there will heat up that
[SPEAKER_01]: will catch on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to harm your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to everybody at this point,
not just my one friend that I know has got
[SPEAKER_01]: a fucking maze in a zoo of extension
cords.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want anybody out there to
anybody to get hurt by a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want your house to get burnt down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want the house to have a small
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want the fire department to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want the adrenaline in your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely don't want the cannabis
industry, the cannabis community to be
[SPEAKER_01]: blamed for that fire down the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine how shitty that sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Bill, did you hear the house burned
down down the street?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I heard they're growing a bunch of
weed in there and one of the grow lights
[SPEAKER_01]: caught on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that just be the worst shit for the
community at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finally almost starting to be taken
seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't look at us like a bunch
of lazy stoners, like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're past the BHO explosion phase of this
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move forward and keep putting a
positive impact on the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not move backwards by burning the shit
down with too many extension cords.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my pet peeve for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, red eyed Rick, you did not send
this to me as a pet peeve, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: contact me on YouTube, let me know how I
can send you a coupon code for a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will hook you up with the free pack of
seeds because I used your YouTube comment
[SPEAKER_01]: for content here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep this awkward
momentum moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of great emails here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is iredo.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to that website on the top,
there's a bunch of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs, it either says grow
help or grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab and you send me a
grow question or ask for grow help,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds on iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first email question on today's
podcast came from my new friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy, Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawrence, make sure you do check your
email because you've got a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawrence's question, this question came in
kind of oddly written, but I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: translate it and break it down into,
I'll just make it make sense for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, Lawrence said, I bought a pack
of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got feminized seeds and they're
asking, can I use one of these female
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds out of this feminized pack to breed
with if I put male pollen on this
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically they're asking, is there a
difference in breeding between feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: female plants and just using a regular,
non-feminized, regular male-female bred
[SPEAKER_01]: female plant is the basic of this question
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, much love from our friend,
Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawrence, bro, thank you for the great
content because this will be fun to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about for just a moment here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main answer is that is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no problem at all with breeding a
male plant to a female plant that came
[SPEAKER_01]: from a feminized pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no problem with that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that I would definitely
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, what you can also do is you can
pollinate that female plant that came from
[SPEAKER_01]: that female pack of seeds with any other
reversed female of your choosing if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: tested it and done the proper background
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, that plant is a very viable plant
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find a keeper that you enjoy,
whether it came from a feminized seed or a
[SPEAKER_01]: regular seed, yes, you can breed to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no difference in that feminized
plant and a regular male-female bred
[SPEAKER_01]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is the way that it was
bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, in my experience,
the difference is the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've repeated this on this show a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say it one more time here
just to get the message out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did learn this analogy came from Mr.
Sol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friend, Mr. Sol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick, thank you for the great info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Sol kind of put it this way one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the way that it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a way to paint the picture so
that you can understand how feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and female bred feminized plants
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just imagine this is what we're going to
build in our brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here on this side, we have got a
plant and it is dumping pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pollen is coming out of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, we've got a row of female
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ripe for pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got their pistols are up in the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're horny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their legs are up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking to party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, dude, let's get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me move this one dreadlock out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's driving me nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to hurt pressed against my
ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so we got a bunch of ladies over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ready to party.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's ready to skeet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've done basically, essentially,
this is not really what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have learned to do is put up a
screen in the middle and put a vacuum up
[SPEAKER_01]: top and suck out all of the pollen that is
male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are only putting female pollen on this
side of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we were able to do is all the
plants on this side of the room will be
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that female pollination happens,
there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like every other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people like to talk like there is a
weakness to these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have less vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have less potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something will be wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more prone to intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the proper work was done before the
breeding project was started, those
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized plants have the potential to be
everything and possibly more than those
[SPEAKER_01]: regular plants could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what I wanted to get to is I want to
talk about breeding with these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been rambling for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is, yes, you absolutely can
breed with those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no difference other than that
pollination was set.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male pollen was basically sucked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, thanks, Mr. So for the great
analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only difference was that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have got plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grew a population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I breed male and female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed male female breeding plants and
feminized plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bought or I gave you a bunch of
packs of both of them and we put all the
[SPEAKER_01]: FEM seeds on one side and all the reg
seeds on the other and grew them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you pull out all the male plants and
put the plants in a population together,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to notice any difference
other than the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be able to tell phenotypes
apart, but there won't be any difference
[SPEAKER_01]: in vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be any difference in pest or
pathogen resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are going to be just as good
as the regular plants, if not better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about now about strains
that I have bred from feminized plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to think of other things
that I've done while I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that morning dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about morning dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morning dew is a grateful dog female,
which came from feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I pollinated that with the Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes morning dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys love morning dew plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morning dew makes amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: High level breeders, growers and smokers
enjoyed the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's mostly sold out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But morning dew was made from a feminized
female and a regular male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that this viewer,
this listener was exactly asking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took that pollen, put it on what was a
feminized female, and that made amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of people ask, will that give me
more ratio of male to female seeds after I
[SPEAKER_01]: do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they come out about 50-50 still.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a question that a lot of
people have asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another cross we could talk about is the
lemon sunrise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon sunrise was the lemon Jeffrey
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lemon skunk and a golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two female plants bred together to make a
feminized lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took my selection out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite lemon Jeffrey cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollinated that one with the Arise and
that one made the lemon sunrise,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were amazing freaking plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar to the cascade and the
firefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you grew them all side by side,
you could see the differences in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commonalities, but you would never know
that some of those were feminized and some
[SPEAKER_01]: were not from feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the overall answer here is absolutely
breed with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is there's no big
difference in that female plant than there
[SPEAKER_01]: was with a female selected from a male
female breeding population.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Lawrence, thank you for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell that this was translated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not being disrespectful in any way,
but if we can ship seeds to where you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to getting you a pack of
iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Lawrence, thank you for the
great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, this next message came from the
iReGenetics website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this one came from our friend Grumpy
Toad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Grumpy Toad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be so grumpy, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be that hard being a toad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, what up Grumpy Toad?
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thank you for being a legitimate
source of grown knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I speak for all of the community
when I say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be called legitimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been legitimized now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like getting a little blue stamp on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am legitimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to say nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to talk bullshit on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that what I say is going into
a microphone and out to the internet and
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going to apply the techniques I
recommend and buy the products I suggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to be mindful of those things
when I'm talking on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me learn how to take a damn
compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend has a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a question here related to
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the audience really loves the
breeding questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, when I see a strange strain
called A and it is a cross between B and
[SPEAKER_01]: C.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got strain A, which is a cross of
plant B and plant C.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any convention that says which of
the parents are the male?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is, does the male come first
and the female second piece from your
[SPEAKER_01]: friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grumpy Toad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a little note here to
myself that I'm going to keep private.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, Grumpy Toad, I'm glad that you
were asking this question because I see a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of new breeders and I see breeders on
social media messing this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of consumers know the basic rule
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like if a breeder got this
wrong in a package, it would deter me from
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the standard here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me touch back on what you were
asking so that I can make this super clear
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy a pack of seeds, let's just
say you're going to buy a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say that you're going to
get a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just we're going to pick a rise as a
random pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise is a golden goat female pollinated
by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would put golden goat X daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I list it that way,
and this will be easy to follow once you
[SPEAKER_01]: figure it out, ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always list ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm listing the cross, the female
plant will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe now that we're talking about
feminized seeds in this episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say the plant that received the
pollen will be the lady plant females
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen donor will be listed second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got the two parentheses,
you see golden goat X daybreaker,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would indicate to me right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daybreaker was the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat was the girl that received the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general horticultural practices,
let's try to teach everybody this in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ladies first when listing genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's another step we can go with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a cross that it is three
different plants together, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: basically these two plants over here in
parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one really good plant that just
never got a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another plant that got
bred to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I list the genetics, it is plant A
cross to plant B and C in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with that indicates to me,
we're always going to do female first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant A on this side is the female
in that equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these two in parentheses were bred
together to make one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that one plant is the pollen
donor that pollinated that female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mathematical equation that we would be
looking at would be plant A times and then
[SPEAKER_01]: in parentheses B, X, C.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's B cross to C just to be clear on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant A would be the female because
it's the first one in the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was crossed to these two
plants which made one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have a name for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is B and C.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that equation, B would be the female
pollinated by C that made a new plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to pollinate A with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're having multiple sets of
brackets, the lady will always come first
[SPEAKER_01]: in that equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions, if I didn't make
that clear, let me know in the comments or
[SPEAKER_01]: send me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a follow up episode because
without drawing that out like a
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematical equation on a chalkboard,
it kind of doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my buddy Grumpy Toad, I hope I answered
this for you because I really got rambling
[SPEAKER_01]: on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lady times male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes you'll see so if I had
two plants that didn't have a name,
[SPEAKER_01]: just plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll say Golden Goat to Daybreaker
didn't get a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just say Golden Goat to Daybreaker
in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll say Platinum Tangi to
Golden Goat over here on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know which is the male and female in
both of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I cross those together,
I just put an X in the middle and show you
[SPEAKER_01]: the bunch of shit on the left side is
going to be the female part.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bunch of shit on the right side is
going to be the male part.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to round rambling on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Grumpy Toad, I owe you a pack of
free seeds.
