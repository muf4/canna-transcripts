[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the coupon code is GFYH25.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, at the top of the show I did
say that we were going to talk about my
[SPEAKER_00]: new strain called The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a great email here from our
friend Marco Esquandolas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Marco
Esquandolas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rye, rye, rocko.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I'm sure you get a lot of requests for
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts dedicated to your seed varieties,
but I thought I would ask a few specific
[SPEAKER_00]: questions to help spur your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a perfectly timed email because I
am going to release The Machine and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Saka Souffle both on Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be part of the Black Friday
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does ask about Saka Souffle and The
Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be focused on The
Machine, so I'm going to skip right to
[SPEAKER_00]: that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Chem De La Chem and which breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this, but I kind of
wanted to focus on those two strains for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next two episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will be The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode obviously will be The
Saka Souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have a bunch of notes here about
The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me cut the rambling and jump right
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following my social media,
you have been seeing the, or my Discord
[SPEAKER_00]: even, you've been seeing a lot of posts
about The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Machine has been in testing and it has
been showing great, amazing, impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people testing it have
harvested their test crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually tasted and smoked some
concentrates made from a test run of The
[SPEAKER_00]: Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all decided that it is impressive
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said I wasn't going to ramble,
but I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into my report about a
strain called The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents of The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Marco Esquandolas asked if,
let me see, there was a specific question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which Chemdelechem is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents of The Machine are
Chemdelechem Cross II Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, the
Chemdelechem came from Top Dog Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is where I believe this one came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was given to me as a clone by a
friend who sprouted the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this clone really stood out in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that more in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the Chemdelechem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemdelechem was ChemD to I-95,
or it is ChemD to I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't guess it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Chemdelechem.
[SPEAKER_00]: ChemD to I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it because it just stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got such good stink to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Chemdelechem brings that old school
skunky with the new school diesel funk
[SPEAKER_00]: with that really crazy chem flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buzz to it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows like a savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something else I should talk about,
which did transfer into The Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the Chemdelechem, which was the
female plant used in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the mother plant that got
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the male side, we do have the Arise,
also known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: My King Solomon is a beautiful specimen of
a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say a stud is the word that
left my brain there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A stud of a male plant of an Arise cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an Arise male that I have named
King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just got his own specific name
because he has such a stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the female Arise plants get labeled
Arise, and then a number Arise F2 number
[SPEAKER_00]: 2, Arise F1 number 4, things like that sit
around in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Arise male, he has simply named
King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the King Solomon Arise is Golden Goat
and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Golden Goat female pollinated
by a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Arise is fairly well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of info on the Internet,
a lot of pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is well known for producing very high
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The offspring come out with very high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost anything I pollinate with that King
Solomon will come out with extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, almost like panic attack potency,
almost like freak you out psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: almost type potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, I call it the fixer plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon likes to fix and improve
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's known for making plants grow
with what we call hypervigour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them grow very very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get big plants that root quite quite
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we know the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about how the
parents grow, and then we'll segue into
[SPEAKER_00]: how the cross itself grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem De La Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a little bit tall and kind of
lanky, but it turns into what I call just
[SPEAKER_00]: spears of nasty dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just long, thick buds with beautiful
colors, beautiful aromas, lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, and it just smells nasty
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't cannabis, you would make it
go far away if it smelled like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else that smelled like that,
you would put it in two or three bags and
[SPEAKER_00]: seal it up and get rid of it, maybe burn
it with fire, maybe destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since it's cannabis, it is such a
tremendously desirable smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, that stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smell it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that stinks so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smell it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke it, people around you,
they go, damn, that weed stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get an eighth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they want some of it immediately
because it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Chem De La Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gets a little bit tall, kind of lanky,
but just fucking gassy and delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypervigour, hyperpotency, super fast
growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to talk about
about the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why did I want to make this cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I love that Chem De La Chem skunk,
gassy funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough of that in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I'm really... it feels like
we go in circles with the flavors of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that are desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while there, it was nothing but
skunk, and then it turned into diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it turned into... Kush was
popular in the Denver area, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody wanted chem, and then then
everybody wanted garlic, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody wanted candy, oh, then cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: was popular, and then garlic came around,
and now it's all the dessert strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruity flavored candy dessert stuff is
what's popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like if you got a fruit flavor and a
dessert in your name, like watermelon
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato or something, that shit's what
everybody wants right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like my turp wheel is coming
back around to liking that skunky,
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel-y stuff that I used to like
probably around 98, 99, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what was real popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming back around to liking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted more of that in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to round them up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get me back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love the flavors and aromas of
the Chem Daily Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I really... I like JJ as a breeder,
and that's where this cross came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I wanted to do some breeding with some
of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you gotta... you gotta breed with
the people, work with the people that you
[SPEAKER_00]: respect and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's mostly why I made it,
and I knew that that growth that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Arise and the potency from the
Arise with that skunky, funkiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just like putting two supermodels
in a room together, knowing that I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make a super supermodel,
I knew it was gonna work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically why I made the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, as a grower, as a smoker,
I felt like all the right ingredients were
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put those together, it was going to
work very well, and I feel like we did
[SPEAKER_00]: reach our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why I named this
cross the Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it came from... excuse me... a
lot of it came from the flavors and aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from this finished plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got chemicals and greasy smells,
and funky stuff, kind of Machine Shop sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of smells, but also I named it the Machine
in honor of Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me at all, you know that I'm a
huge comedy nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to comedy shows, I love
watching comedy shows, I listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts all day constantly when I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan of laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the people that makes me laugh the
most is motherfucking Brent Kreisler.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude will make you laugh your ass...
make me laugh my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be working hard, I could be in a
funky mood, it could be early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, and Burt Kreischer will say
something ridiculous in a podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will laugh until I have to go take a
piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to make a strain named after my
friend Burt Kreischer just because I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is named after Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trolling his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Burt Kreischer, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain is named after Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been naming strains after Grateful
Dead songs, after reggae artists,
[SPEAKER_00]: after mystical things and motivational
things, and I love comedy and I love
[SPEAKER_00]: laughter, so I decided it was time to name
a strain after one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Burt Kreischer got a strain named after
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Machine comes from a long story that
Burt tells in one of his specials,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is about how... I don't want to
ruin his joke, but if you haven't heard it
[SPEAKER_00]: by now, I don't know where you have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burt Kreischer learns Russian in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't learn Russian at all,
but he gets to go on a free trip to
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He becomes involved in the Russian mafia,
and he tells them that he is the Machine
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from the I am the Machine joke
from Brent Kirchner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the name comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rambled for a long time about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the actual strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Burt Kreischer,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude has made me laugh a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to want to know
the flowering time of this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into grower mode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering time of the Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes will finish within 63 to
70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, maybe let them go about 72
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those super chem heavy gassy, stanky ones,
maybe 72 days, but 60 to 70 days is the
[SPEAKER_00]: prime zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 63, 65 days is where most of the
phenotypes are going to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of why it got the name the
Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chemical flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chemical smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are gassy smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's a hint of like lemon
fuel, but it's mostly chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy, funky dirtiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hints of coffee, some lower notes
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of chemically, machine shop,
greasy kind of smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of overwhelming,
honestly, sometimes some phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your eyes kind of itchy,
kind of burny when you're trimming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about growth shapes and
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people growing this are going to
want to know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are going to make
long branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are what I call the chem and the
kush phenotypes, which are usually pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: identifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've grown any chem, you know that it
kind of stays a little bit tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes those long spear type nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've grown kush, you know it makes
kind of more like popcorn balls and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stretchier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem, it is spears and tighter nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And earlier in flower, it's got a nasty
berries sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like dirty, funky smells,
like rotten putrid stuff and berries at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time, which later turns into a
skunky, gassy kind of a thing when you dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the chem dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, in my opinion, it smells like
the old school original Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the chem dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a kush dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, it's got longer
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever grown kush, you know that
some of the older old school OG kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just gets real branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you flower it, all those
branches kind of fill in with big popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: ball nugs and the top makes a big glory
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what the kush dominant
phenotype does.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kush phenotype will be earthy and just
earthy and dirtier in aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be not as berries,
not as gassy, more earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get an earthy dirty thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've made that point clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is going to be more chill,
more indica dominant buzz, more put you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the couch, more knock you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's got big fat whiter leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem is gassier and nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I wrote down a head killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz will make you forget where you
were and what you're doing while you were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be walking to the fridge to get a
drink and you'll forget that you needed a
[SPEAKER_00]: drink until you realize you're so thirsty
that your mouth is stuck to your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these phenotypes come out
distinctly chem or distinctly kush and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of them show much of the golden
goat trait other than the the fast growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and the high potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of that is attributed to by
the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting the aromas and flavors
of the kush and chem and the speed of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and that high potency is kicking in
from that tropical part of the sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I think that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to find very heavy kush
phenotypes and very heavy chem phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: and then things right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to find something that's
got the amount of couch lock you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of head buzz you like and then
that right in the middle beautiful buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really enjoy the kind of sits you
down and makes you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you can do is just sit there and
ponder life for a little bit or you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: staring at a painting and seeing a totally
different painting in that painting that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of herb that this is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the gassy, the chemi, the kushy
and the potency of that tropical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within these ranges of kush and chem I
do find what I believe to be three not
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct phenotypes but basically
categories of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably several phenotypes that
will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy the variation but there are
three categories of phenotypes that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctly identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about those three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is what I call the pine cone
category which that one is the kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG kush type of category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell more musty,
more earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get your coffee,
your chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your indica dominant phenotypes are going
to be that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more pine cone size and
shape buds, more jaggedy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be your pine cone size
and shape buds all over the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: not as big long spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only say that because there is another
phenotype called the spear which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these pine cone shaped buds are going
to be the gassy, musty flavors and aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: your kushy type varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, your bigger leaf
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be what I call the pine
cone phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be OG kush dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is what I call the foxtail
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some phenotypes within this line
that just simply produce foxtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from the chem D and the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see that a lot pop up in the chem
but things that are made with the chem do
[SPEAKER_00]: make that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that in the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it in some other chem crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That very well could be from the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get minimal foxtailing,
it's not crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just see some bulbous calyxes,
little extra bulbous, what do we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They swell a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stack up a little bit harder than
you're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a trait from the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is another very distinct maybe
a phenotype, maybe a category of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes which I call the spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the stinky chem dominant
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just long spears of bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a silvery sort of a tint to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a purple hue with silver trichomes
up and down them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look velvety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stink like skunk and gas and
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three distinct phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pine cone is the gassy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spears is that chem dominant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foxtails is very potent and seems to
kind of be the blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that chem in there and then it's
got the chem from the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that cushy flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful blend of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for more of a head
buzz, you want the one with the long spear
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and the longer leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to sit down on your ass and be
knocked out, get that fat leaf one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for that beautiful blend
and with all the beautiful turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want that foxtail phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're looking at my social media
and watching the photos, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoso J got one of the plants that I may
actually consider that foxtail phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not extreme foxtails, but you'll see
what I mean by the bulbous calyxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the swollen bracts all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful plant, but it did do a
little foxtailing that was not Zoso J's
[SPEAKER_00]: fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is simply attributed to the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you look at a lot of the plants
that Mobius grows on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: he got the chem and the cush dominant
phenotypes and posted a lot of pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one with no leaves, that is the cush
dominant phenotype, and the one with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of leaves, that is more chem dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost imagine and predict the
aromas of the two phenotypes I saw from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mobius just by looking at the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to check out my
notes, see where we are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we're to the part of the
notes where it says tips and tricks and
[SPEAKER_00]: details.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're going to give the
breeder nuances, the breeder tips and
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks on how to maximize the potential of
the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a very fast vegging plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my plants grow very fast all the
way through their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one grows very, very quickly and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it does slow down when you flip
it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is quite the opposite of a lot of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually do go a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one will kind of slow down,
so you don't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to worry about the stretch,
but it is not as extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably double in size by the
time you were done flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got six foot of flowering
space, flower it at three feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, allow for light space and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your three foot tall plant will be six
feet tall by the time it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's two feet tall, expect four feet by
the time your plant finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the test growers did report that
these plants do take a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will suck up a lot of nitrogen and
veg because they do grow quite quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they do continue to eat a lot of
nutrients throughout the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed these plants heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do pay very close attention to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they show you any signs of deficiency
or signs of burn, adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have reports that they eat a
lot, so I can warn you to feed them heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, myself and a lot of test growers
notice that these plants do tend to like
[SPEAKER_00]: it a little bit drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to water these plants as
frequently as heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let them get a little bit drier,
which is often the case with most kush
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things from the kush line, the OG kushes,
the old kush stuff, the Tahoe,
[SPEAKER_00]: the SFV, that stuff does better when you
let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more likely to drown a kush plant
than you are to let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a kush dominant
phenotype, those plants will like much
[SPEAKER_00]: drier conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you lean more toward the chem dominant
phenotypes, they may want a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did notice that they do tend to
like it a little bit drier, which if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing a lot of OG kush stuff,
that is a trait that the OG kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very common across the entire kush
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so it does also, this is also a
trait that is very common across the kush
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will eat a lot of cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed them cow mag, you'll see the
leaves give you big fat serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will get bold and strong,
don't overdo it, but they do like cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get cow mag calcium deficient in
mid flower if you don't feed them enough
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say cow mag all the time
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they're sold in the same bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it easy for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get calcium deficient is
the one that you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also learned that feeding kush and
chem plants kelp products or kelp really
[SPEAKER_00]: do increase the potency and that stanky
aroma, that skunky, gassy, kushy earthy
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that is really enhanced, in my
opinion, in my experience, by feeding a
[SPEAKER_00]: good kelp product in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can add some kelp products that
will really add to your stankiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
growth of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that the chem de la chem
does like to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes to grow long branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise does like to make big,
tall, fast growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do recommend trellising or tomato
cages or some sort of supports for these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will trellis very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pop and twist well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you spread them and bend them,
it just makes more shoots and those grow
[SPEAKER_00]: up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend supports early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would trellis them out in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that trellis all set up or have your
tomato cages or your sticks ready because
[SPEAKER_00]: when those buds start setting in,
they're going to get top heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fill up big spears of
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start toppling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get sticky and stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a pain in the ass if you
don't start getting them supported ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about supporting our plants,
these plants really bulk up in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and all of the test growers really
mentioned and really noticed that these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants beef up and bulk up the last two
weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend you let them go the
70, maybe 72 days the first time you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them go and see what they do that last
10, 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really might expand, bulk up,
beef up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would hate to cut down at week 9 and
week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really exploded and you wasted some
growth on there, wasted some weight that
[SPEAKER_00]: really could have helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really bulk up in the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did notice that temperature swings
really make these plants colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants acted really, really well to
cold temperatures during the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some really drastic temperature
swings here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my test places was getting really
hot during the day and really cold at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the plants, we'll talk about that
one later, some of the plants did not like
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machine really seemed to run well in
the cold at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really brought out the colors,
made the buds nice and dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think it reacted, responded very
well to those cold night temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machine is now what I would call the
gassiest and stankiest strain in my lineup
[SPEAKER_00]: that is now available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It compares very closely in stank and
aroma to the double dose and also it would
[SPEAKER_00]: compete with the dark hollow, but it is
now what I would call the gassiest in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chem aroma, that chemstank,
you just can't beat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so skunky, stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gross in a delicious way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you smell it and you're like,
that's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I smell it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something disgustingly pleasing about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I think it is best to
have carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend and over-recommend and
highly suggest again that you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filters and extra odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before, when you trim this one,
when I trim this one, I don't trim a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did test runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we would crack open these plants to
trim them, my eyes would get like just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would, I'd feel like there was
chemicals in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would burn and they would itch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like I was allergic to it in
a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you crack open a bag, it makes my
eyes itch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's almost like a, it's like a
Pavlov effect, a Pavlovian.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you, whatever Pavlov, shout out to
that dude in his dogs, Pavlovian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how you say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that sort of effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I would open up the jar, my eyes
would itch and burn like it does when I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying itch and burn in a bad
way, but it would get my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes would go heavy and droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the smell would trigger my
body and my eyes would just go,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, you're going to get that nice
head buzz pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just trimming it made my eyes itch and
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super gassy, super stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it will be, when you're trimming,
it will be some of the most pungent,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, stankiest offensive herb you ever
experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offensive is the word I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good thing to mention, these plants
are very resistant to mold and mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grew this one outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not get the mildew that a lot of
people experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good friend who got, uh,
they got some problematic bugs during
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said that this plant was
basically left alone by some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the testers did report that
these plants were resistant to mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: to bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we had a lot of people grow these
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody reported any powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody reported any bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I did have a friend who grew this in
a room with mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not get mites on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is bug resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have learned that these plants are
very resistant to bugs, very resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that these plants are resistant
to pathogens, resistant to bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they also grow super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they smell really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they come out with extremely high
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they tolerate a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that these plants would be great
for beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I would really worry about
is over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for people who may not be able to get
to the grow as often, for people who
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't in there all day, for people who
may forget to water, these may be great
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I said, other than that,
uh, the opportunity to over water these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and the idea that they don't like
as much water, these are great plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten to smoke a few of the flowers
from a couple of different grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, something that I noticed is this
cushy, chemi, chemical, gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hit it, it just feels like
chemicals and cotton mouth coat my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I exhale, that flavor and aroma
just lingers and my eyes get heavy right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't get that smell off of my
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can wash my hands two or three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you smoke a joint, if you break up
a joint and smoke a joint of this weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: your fingers will smell like it for the
rest of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also super thick smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked two, two batches of flowers that
made me say that reminds me of back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day when we used to say we got the chronic
and the smoke expands in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weed gave me that lung expandy
feeling that I haven't had in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I smoke a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke a lot of dabs and there's just
something in the lungs that I haven't felt
[SPEAKER_00]: in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminded me, like I said, of that old
school and we used to call it the chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would expand in your lungs and you
would smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminded me of that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a friend in Denver,
make some concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are two friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a lovely couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want their names set on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they are a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow and make concentrates in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made some concentrates of the
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to smoke some before a podcast one
night and I do not remember writing,
[SPEAKER_00]: recording, editing, doing that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all a blur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the concentrates from the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like the thing from the guys that
men in black have, they go blink,
[SPEAKER_00]: blink, and then your whole memory is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what this stuff is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just emptied my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if you've got something to do,
maybe if you've got something to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the perfect smoke for that
because it made me, uh, it just made my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also after that, when I got done recording
while I was editing, I ate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like when I smoked the machine,
I get extreme munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are, uh, if you're a cancer
patient or if you've got a medicine or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is stopping you from
eating, if you need an increased appetite,
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine may be a great medical strain
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may help you out, may increase that
appetite, may help you put some weight on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, help you build bulk up for the winter
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for my, uh, my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, overall, this was an easy to grow
strain and top quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can grow this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a beginner grower, as long as
you don't overwater this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow this and it looks like you
grew something that should have been super
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an easy plant to grow that will
put out connoisseur smoke is a note that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it handles overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll handle underfeeding, which you've
got to pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come out better if you feed it
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it handles temp swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is super easy to trim,
uh, big fat bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nugs, the dried and cured nugs look
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big fat pine cones, big long spears,
uh, beautiful dark colors, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful layers of trichomes,
uh, super frosty, gross aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice dense nugs, lots of dense,
dense nuggets come out of these crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down again, easy for beginners,
low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you time it right, uh, the biggest
issue will be height and a stank and
[SPEAKER_00]: something to look out for will be
overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to time it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were limited on space, flower early
because this one's going to double in
[SPEAKER_00]: height on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to veg very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's going to flower and it will
double in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you are prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's great plants, uh, for quick runs
because it veges so quickly and is ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to flip early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you may, uh, you may be
vegging for four to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to cut that down and just
plan on the four because they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may save you a couple of weeks,
which is always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a grow that gets more plants,
more grows per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it doesn't require a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it supported, pull a few leaves,
feed the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote down, she will bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty easy plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flip it early, don't get it too
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get her too tall, you could pop
her, twist her, bend her, tie her down,
[SPEAKER_00]: do what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes very well to that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does recover very quickly and very
well from popping, topping and abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the machine is a great plant for
quick runs because she veges super
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She flowers in about nine or 10 weeks,
which is great for top quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can find a phenotype that is
done in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will suit your purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more detail before I start
wrapping up this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were going to grow a run of the
machine right now with what I know about
[SPEAKER_00]: her, uh, with the experience I've got with
this plant, the way that I would do it is
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me preface by saying a lot of
people are probably growing in a five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five tent or something similar,
uh, maybe a small room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us don't have major, uh,
high ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've got a little bit of space to
work with, uh, in a five by five tent or
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably do nine three gallon pots
and I would veg them up until they are
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12 to 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to spread them out,
if you want to trellis them, I would top
[SPEAKER_00]: them one time early, about 10 to 12 inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they start branching,
take a top out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put the trellis net down and spread
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that go for maybe a week because
they're going to veg quickly into that
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis, then flip them because they're
going to grow tall and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, nine, three gallon pots,
veg them until they're about 12 to 18
[SPEAKER_00]: inches tall, then flip them and they will
fill your space or veg them till they're
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 or 12 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top them one time, spread them out with
the trellis, let them fill that space,
[SPEAKER_00]: then flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll be satisfied with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would consider four, seven gallon
pots in a five by five space, but as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as they veg, that may get out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may outgrow your space more quickly
than you were prepared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I wanted to run a quick crop of
these plants, the way that I would do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again would be nine, three gallon pots in
a five by five, veg them until they're
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12 to 18 inches tall, then flower
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them flower for nine to 10 weeks,
maybe 72 days at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop them, dry them, cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a quick crop of top shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would consider four,
seven gallon pots in a five by five,
veg them until they're about 12 to 18
inches tall, then flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may replace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the grateful dog in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
