[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate y'all having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Frosty brought a good friend,
a new friend, somebody that I feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known because I've been following him
on social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Piff is at the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate you having me, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to push this mic just a little
bit to your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to eat that a little
bit to be heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got kind of a low voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You seem a little shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to break you up that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get you welcome and
comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys make sure you go follow my
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty, tell everybody your Instagram
handle so they can follow you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Frosty Organics, just all together,
just Frosty Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go find him, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Piff, how do we find you on the social
media?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's Dr. Piff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Dr. Underscore Piff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check him out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at his pics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's got some great pics going on up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, if Frosty's here,
we're going to talk about No-Till.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to get right into it
because we've been chatting it up for
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a while here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell everybody's fired up and ready
to get into podcasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to drop this music out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we do that, I like to tell
everybody what we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the Sunset Sherb that you guys
rolled?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunset Sherb.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some delicious flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you guys, I'm smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will hear it in my throat and in my
voice tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got jam on the flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's so delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: He cracked open that jar, and I was like,
yeah, I'm going to smoke that other joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: They smoked one joint with me,
and it was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when he cracked open that jar,
I was like, I'm smoking this joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you rolled it, that was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one of you guys grew that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, this is from a place, Clearwater
Buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a wholesale around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually, you know, just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a damn good job with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for bringing the Sunset Sherb to
the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: The house is going to be all cloudy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Piff over here rolls middle finger
size joints, and they just puff them like
[SPEAKER_04]: it's nothing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took dabs, and they were like,
ah, we're just going to enjoy the aroma in
[SPEAKER_04]: the air from your dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys don't smoke VHL, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, no VHL.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll do the solvent list and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been smoking some really good rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to smoke a little bit of the dab
logic or, you know, the oleo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oleo, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get their extractor's choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got some good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Colorado is definitely on top of it,
whether it's VHL or solvent list.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely got some of the premier
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: 710 Lab is killing it, too, but it's too
hard to find it right now, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all in the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got to get on the med side where it's
affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm medical, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the no-butane, no-VHL thing just
kind of a personal choice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were talking about diet and
stuff earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of want to wrap it back around
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it makes me feel better and stuff,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I was smoking a can of VHL,
I was doing it every day and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I would, you know, sometimes
feel like pressure and stuff like that at
[SPEAKER_03]: certain times, like, you know,
not all the time, but I would almost get
[SPEAKER_03]: like a headache every once in a while and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can just, you know, not smoke and no
VHL.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can really tell that, you know,
it's just, it's better for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't good for you?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't smoke a lot of flour because
you can hear it right here in my throat.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from that joint that I smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes my eyes feel itchy for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about itchy, but it does
something different to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the only part about it that I
would take out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dabs doesn't give me that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't noticed any negative effects
from the dabbing yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys notice, point them out to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to, maybe I won't notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you, I think you like it too,
just cause you're a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a quick guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like to get things done and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just get high real quick,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to sit here and smoke four
joints to get where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No roll up or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just hit up your nail or turn on your,
turn on your email.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you dab if it were up to
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more of a rosin guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even really, I mean, a freshly
freshly freshly pressed melts nice every
[SPEAKER_02]: now and then, you know, but, uh,
I'm more of a rosin guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crazy when you can get,
uh, the turps that you can get from BHO in
[SPEAKER_02]: really quality rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, uh, it's really credit to the
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, um, those turps can't, they can't
really be captured unless the cannabis was
[SPEAKER_02]: quality enough to, to, to do it in
solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference between,
um, you know, doing BHO and solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, is you can take some all right
stuff with BHO and turn it into a really
[SPEAKER_02]: quality looking product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a solventless, it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare that you see something like
that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take some really quality cannabis to,
to make a super premium product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I like smoking rosin that was made
from bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise I have never had rosin made
straight from flour that I appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys gave me the, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people who isolate the turpsin in
a, in a ice wax and a full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already premier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you, um, when you take away what's
not melted and you leave it in a freshly
[SPEAKER_02]: pressed rosin or, or just rosin fresh
frozen or whatever the case may be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just have such a premier product is a,
I don't know, to be able to compare it to
[SPEAKER_02]: something like BHO and not, uh,
have a carbohydrate, um, extract it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's really nice to have the
peace of mind in the back of your mind
[SPEAKER_02]: that there was nothing, no butane ran over
the plant that you took your 60 day
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of just washing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen my friends watch my wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've watched my friend's faces when I've
said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just blow butane over and
turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew this for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that do butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're, they're real artists that
know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they can explain to you step by step
what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's so many people out
there pretending that they know what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's, there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's good extracts and there's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're good extractors and bad
extractors, just like all things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So extractor is not a derogatory term
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, do you guys smoke the, uh,
the high cannabinoid or high terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't say we don't,
we, we, we haven't been smoking BHO for
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say over half a year now,
but what we have had, our garden ran into
[SPEAKER_02]: a full, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I mean, it's not like we didn't
try it or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out premiere and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a quality in quality out,
but it's just, it's just a choice thing at
[SPEAKER_02]: this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, um, we're already growing clean
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, we, we'd rather just stay on
a solventless lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes perfect sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put anything else in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to quit coughing pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I'm going to quit hitting that
joint and I'll get, I'll get my voice
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys want to jump right into no till,
um, so no till no till, uh, to the best of
[SPEAKER_04]: my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we've done an episode a long
time ago, and I feel like I may have
[SPEAKER_04]: learned a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start a pot with a conditioned soil
with a very amended soil, then you let
[SPEAKER_04]: that soil come to life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there worms in that soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got worms and a lot of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about the ingredients next.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a pot filled with, uh,
amendments, uh, lots of things,
[SPEAKER_04]: worms, and it comes alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you plant your plant in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then your plant grows and you only have to
feed it water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everything's already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can add teas by the look on your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can do teas and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So see the very first time, like,
um, you got to get the decomposition to,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, be going quick enough to be feeding
the plant correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all those things I mixed in have to get
broken down and start becoming
[SPEAKER_04]: bioavailable for my plant over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does, how long does that take 30,
60 days?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would say the first round,
the first round, you got to just be doing
[SPEAKER_03]: a whole lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be doing like, uh, you know,
I would do a lot of bow cashew and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top dress a lot of bow cashew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, speed up that, that process like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the, yeah, the worms will like,
and stuff like that feed a lot of,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, uh, malted barley and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just grind up a whole bunch of
two row malted barley and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just top dress that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see your worms come to the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, uh, just them coming up and
mulching, so much, it was just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, speed it up, speed it up,
speed it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the more you speed it up,
then I think after that now, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got pots that are probably on 14,
you know, 15 rounds or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in those pots, I am only feeding water
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I do a few top dressings,
just like, uh, you know, earthworm
[SPEAKER_03]: castings, you know, I do a few malted
barley's, um, but really nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like after I pull the plants
out, um, you know, I just pull like the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the root ball out just cause I'm
in like 10 and 15 gallons right now in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I have more space, I'll do beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beds are better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave the, uh, the stock and the,
and the root ball and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll let it just decompose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just plant right next to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now I'm having to pull out,
you know, the little bitty root ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I pull it out though,
um, I leave it in there a few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I top dress, bow cashew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I feed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worms will come eat, you know,
what they need to and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beneficials will break down the roots
and stuff like that for food and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll speed it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like after like five or seven days,
then we'll pull them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll pull it out and then I'll,
uh, I'll plant in, uh, either a cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be from a cup or a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not really disturbing the soil at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe a, the top layer a little
bit, maybe a fifth size section.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping everything just going on stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that ecosystem is just rocking,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, if you just saw how much
like beneficials I have going in my pots,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put something in there and it
decomposes so quick and it's just being
[SPEAKER_03]: broken down so quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, this is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I threw, excuse me, what would you
throw on top to, uh, what'd you throw on
[SPEAKER_04]: top to let it decompose right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, right now, um, we don't really need to
throw anything on top right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, just because I'm so far in
flower on a, you know, on, on the section
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm doing right now, the,
the right section though, I would top
[SPEAKER_03]: dress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just threw it into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's on like, uh, five days into
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that one, you know, top dress some,
some Neem and kelp just to get a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of good, you know, uh, minerals and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I, what I've been feeding even,
you know, right, whenever I get into a
[SPEAKER_03]: flower or even in a veg and stuff like
that is I've been feeding insect frass has
[SPEAKER_03]: like every micro macro nutrient available
to a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean talks a lot about insect frass also.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like two, two, two,
like it's everything, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you feed it to your plant and you
see them just like going ham, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you feed a few extra things with like some
allo, you know, but really what,
[SPEAKER_03]: what I really feed, um, in a flower and
stuff like that is what builds flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flowers for us, you know, not using any
type of like synthetic, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: things to, to build the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're using is, is a potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potassium is what builds a flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, banana peels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I mean, it'll throw these things huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a fermented fruit juices with
bananas and stuff like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so you can get it like a fermented
fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, it's for men and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's super strong and potassium and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I've been doing is I just been
using coconut water.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at coconut water, dude has so
much potassium in it, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it has folic acid, it has all kinds
of- You can get powdered coconut water if
[SPEAKER_03]: you need it delivered, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's crazy, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Build A Soil sells it, but you know,
I feel like you can get it at other
[SPEAKER_03]: places, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Jeremy and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, you know, no, no bad words about
Jeremy and them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, I think you can,
uh, get things cheaper and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: go elsewhere and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the beginning to use them and
stuff like that, to buy some soil from
[SPEAKER_03]: them and they make things easy so you
don't have to mix your own soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, that's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, other than that, you know,
I would say just, just go where you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow an aloe plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, aloe is so huge in, uh, in the no-till
regimen just because you want to just be
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding, you know, the, uh, the whole soil
system and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to be just, you know,
getting everything everywhere and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stopped using potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just use, uh, just silica now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's pure silica.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from rice holes, made from rice
holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not getting potassium boost and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only potassium I'm, you know,
feeding to the plants is the coconut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I'm, you know, using this stuff like
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I stuck a carrot in one of your no-till
pots right now, how long would it take for
[SPEAKER_04]: that carrot to be gone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, dude, it would be quick, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say three, four days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just eat that carrot up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, quick, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the fungi, um, the fungus would
overtake it so quick, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think mushrooms would start growing
around and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that white fur on it real quick and
disappear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three days is fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How hot is it in the sun?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you stick your hand in that pot,
how hot do you think it's real hot inside
[SPEAKER_04]: there?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's like, uh, you know,
I would say it's, you know, not,
[SPEAKER_03]: not, not cold or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like nice and, you know, it's always
moist and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the pots always stay, uh, you know,
very moist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have, I have a few pots in
there that I grow some, even some
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetables in and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We throw some peppers and stuff in the pot
and stuff like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest your, you know, your cannabis and
be harvesting some peppers, eating some
[SPEAKER_03]: peppers and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing them all together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it as a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, uh, I think pests hate that shit
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a hot ass plant show.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to eat that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, they're, they're fucking
scramming, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just throwing good things up top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the cover crop that I
usually plan is lemongrass, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we do some clover and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're trying to pull nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to pull nitrogen directly
from the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best thing to do is a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have it, you have a good cover crop
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you throw some mulch on there
and, you know, you need to throw some,
[SPEAKER_03]: some good mulch on there, but that cover
crop will grow so quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're throwing, you're,
you're cutting that, throwing that on
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're taking leaves off, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mulch is getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your defoliation that you do,
the leaves you pull off, you just throw
[SPEAKER_04]: those in the pot also, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they're green.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have any trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think how much food is in those leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nitrogen going right back into
your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're recycling, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that cannibalism?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is in your cover crop,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Since you're going on about cover crop,
I'm going to get as much info as I can
[SPEAKER_04]: about this cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the best thing to do is, uh,
for sure is clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff like that is just, you know,
crimson clover and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, you know, that's just going to
pull like the most nitrogen and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, you know,
you throw some lemongrass in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you throw some good things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw a pepper plant, you know,
throw some, throw some vegetables in there
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't really say a tomato or nothing
like that, or like something that's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to pull a whole bunch of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Suck up all your nutrients to get too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little alfalfa size type stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw something simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I'm building my, when you're
building a no-till pot, uh, what
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients go into the pot to get you
started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so the ingredients to go in,
I think, uh, you know, it's, it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: long process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, um, you know, they're,
they're using, it's basically,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, compost, like just for the most part,
like just say for the most part,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, like Malibu compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys almost all your larger grow
stores will have some Malibu compost for
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, they'll order it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Amazon has it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compost, earthworm, castings, you know,
um, that's going to be one part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's going to be one part,
you know, peat moss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it would be, uh, you know,
I think, uh, what the other, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: one part pumice, you know, you're making
it real fluffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think, uh, you know,
it's, it's real simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's just a simple recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it's just like,
uh, one, uh, I think they're doing like
[SPEAKER_03]: one cup to every cubic foot, you know,
whenever we were mixing it back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day, I didn't mix it in so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were, we were buying it, um,
when I was running another house that I
[SPEAKER_03]: had going and stuff like that,
you know, we're trying to follow laws and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that, that we all have plant
counts and, you know, we're doing our
[SPEAKER_03]: medical thing, but, uh, you know,
I, I shut down a house that I had running
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, I was doing some,
some good things over there, but I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to just buy it from Jeremy,
get things rocking so quick, just cause I
[SPEAKER_03]: know how to get this ecosystem going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I didn't have to make the soil
and have to wait fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few weeks or whatever, wait for it to,
you know, cook and do its thing and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, you know, cause it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get them hot pockets be burning your
plants and shit, you know, we were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: super soils back in the day and all that
stuff is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, let's just use Jeremy now,
get this cheap ass soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a good setup over at build a
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, he doesn't pay us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't rep him, but build a soil is a
good place to start for resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just, you know, I just get that,
that, um, I think it's like, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get his, his cheapest one, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the cheapest soil that he
has.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to get the most basic one cause I'm
going to top dress Karanja and Neem and
[SPEAKER_03]: kelp and I'm going to top dress all these
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, you know, I don't need him to put
all these things in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a top dress, Bo Kashi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a top dress, you know, uh,
the best earthworm casting is possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this guy named Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to tell y'all his,
uh, actual company or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've actually gave too many friends
his number and he can't keep me loaded up
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done the same thing to myself before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go shop here and then you go to get it and
all your friends bought it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck his own verma, uh, compost,
you know, company has his, his worm shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he's selling it for,
for the load to me and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I can get 70 pounds or like 50 bucks,
but you know, he hooks me up and when I
[SPEAKER_03]: get that and when I get, uh, you know,
even when I get Malibu compost,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I order Malibu compost,
top dress with some Malibu compost,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we make teas and Malibu compost,
but when I top dress with some Malibu
[SPEAKER_03]: compost, even every once in a while in
some pots, you know, that needed after so
[SPEAKER_03]: many rounds and stuff like that,
you see so many worms and so many
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficials and so much life in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, just let me get this
free life from, you know, California,
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever this came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let me get this free life from Don,
you know, and then all this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: free life is coming and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I try and go into nature and go
hiking and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back, touch my plants and,
you know, just try and bring nature and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff in there, bring, you know,
any fun guy that's out there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, just try and, you know,
bring it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, I run large commercial
grows, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about going out to nature
and bring that into my grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys were on a different playing field
than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens is, uh, even, even right
now I have some, uh, some plants that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, getting pretty close to
finishing and, uh, you know, they still
[SPEAKER_03]: price they, uh, they have like,
you know, uh, you know, three weeks or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, we just brought some new
plants in and stuff like that and threw
[SPEAKER_03]: them into flower and, you know,
they had a few mites on them and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just from, uh, you know, not being on my,
uh, IPM sprays like I should and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that and having little one gallons
over here that, uh, you know, I get
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings and stuff like that from friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they got a few spider mites and stuff
like that on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take them in there and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't even have to spray or
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The left side or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's so far into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we spray anything,
we spray something, you know, so organic
[SPEAKER_03]: that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably wouldn't spray an oil after day
35.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I sprayed anything, I'd spray,
uh, um, you know, labs, lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spray something like that, that,
uh, your plant would eat your plant would
[SPEAKER_03]: use it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got to be kind of careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You spray that too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll raise the bricks levels in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quick and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go test the bricks levels in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: After you spray some fucking lives,
you're like, you know, this is crazy,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but it just has so much sugar
and so much, you know, beneficial and so
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good shit to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your plant eats it though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go too crazy with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You totally overdo it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I would spray something like
that or even spray like some olive oil or
[SPEAKER_03]: some, you know, some coconut water or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't really say, you know,
go spray an oil after day 35, but you
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't really need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm saying, these plants are over
here doing fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: These other plants have been hanging here
over a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're clean now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sprayed them a few times with an IPM
that I, you know, normally doing stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, but then naturally I think the
beneficials coming from the left side,
[SPEAKER_03]: coming to the right side and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let these mites come in here and
play and get real scared and shit like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they, you know, the beneficials
come eat them all and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it's taken care of and
then we're just, you know, sticking the
[SPEAKER_03]: land in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, let's make sure we get this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been introducing lace wings into my
IPM mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got three different kinds of
predator mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the hypoaspis in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some other guys crawling around
in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't pronounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've been releasing lace wing
eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I think the lace wings are doing
is they heard the little bit of spider
[SPEAKER_04]: mites I couldn't get rid of are herded
onto one plant, onto one cola.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lace wings all around the room and
they're like in a circle around this one
[SPEAKER_04]: table.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's another ring of them
around this one plant and all the spider
[SPEAKER_04]: mites have congregated at this one plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just cut that nug off and all the
spider mites I feel like will be gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the lace wings will be like,
ha ha.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was neat to come in and be like,
I don't see any mites anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just on one cola.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, all the mites in the whole
facility congregated here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all those fucking lace wings ate
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were going to have a feast on the
leftovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're gone now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut that cola out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's just lace wings flying
around looking for food.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like herded them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually dying and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to understand they're shitting
in your pots and stuff like that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And throwing insect grass in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're breeding and making more eggs,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dying and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then whatever they're eating and stuff
like that has a lot of nutrients and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going back into my pots and living
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun watching nature, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get more into buying some
beneficials and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have some good ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see like, what are those red mites?
[SPEAKER_03]: The real fast little red mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of those that come up and
they eat my, if I have any mites,
[SPEAKER_03]: some spider mites or something like that,
they eat all those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look on the bottom of my leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have a bunch of those little red
ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are probably the persimilis or
swarskies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a magazine in the other room with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got pictures of all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll go see which ones you've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll identify them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll see what you got in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of people pay money to order
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We buy them by the shit ton at the
commercial, girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like tea bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're hanging these little tea bags
all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get Hyapostis mites and stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have those all in the soil,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll come organically if you invite
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come a little bit up on the stalk and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't really play in the leaves
and stuff like that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you they do when the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They climb up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hate light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they climb up there and the lights go
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't see them during the day very
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when the lights go off, they go off.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Californus mites, we're reading that
they may not like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, the ones that we release to eat the
bugs, they may just be running away is
[SPEAKER_04]: what we read.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use them still.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get more into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys use bugs to take care of your
problems, you listeners, because bugs are
[SPEAKER_04]: better than sprays.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bugs don't make your extracts
taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bugs won't make you sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you cut down those plants and dry
them and your buds start drying,
[SPEAKER_04]: the bugs are going to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: The predator mites you put on there,
they're going to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go find food somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those bugs are just like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: When there's nothing to eat and nothing to
fuck, they'll go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you good IPM, though,
that will keep everything away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear it because that's one of
the things I'm getting toward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to say that they get these
crazy mites or these crazy shits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick goes to a few gardens that some of
our buddies have and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go in people's gardens, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring whatever they have back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Patrick goes to see some shit,
and he's like, dude, this is crazy,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever they have over here, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get to see these crazy things,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just haven't been able to see them,
just having such a healthy ecosystem and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the IPM that I do that I think will
even keep everything away, the reason why
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not jumping on this left side is
because until day 21 or until day 28 or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever like that, I'm over here
spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's real simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say two to one, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neem Karanja is better than Neem or
Karanja by themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to spray a tablespoon
per gallon per se, you would do two
[SPEAKER_03]: teaspoons of Neem, one teaspoon of
Karanja.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to do that per gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after that, I would do like a half
ounce of essential oils that you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: from Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: The essential oils are pretty good,
yeah, the essential oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do a half ounce of essential oils
per gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you would do, what else would you
do after that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You would do, I guess, one eighth teaspoon
of silica just to keep it real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a little bit of aloe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's real easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the aloe is going to get it juicy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The silica is going to be good for the
plants, and everything else is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: make bugs wish they weren't fucking there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to feed a little bit of extra
nutrients and stuff like that to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants while you're doing it early in
flower and stuff like that, I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: feed some full power in there too,
some humic acid.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, go spray that three days in a
row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spray three days in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go in there and spray it all over your
plants for three days whenever the lights
[SPEAKER_03]: are off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, they're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys are all paying attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people message me about how to
get rid of mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a completely organic way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to ask them to do it again
because I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have to use that 30 second back
button.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're done, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, after you spray that,
if you want to try another one,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can even do one that we've really
found out, enzymes will really fuck up a
[SPEAKER_03]: pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good for beneficials, but they're
bad for pests and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've heard of soap nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, tell me about soap nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, soap nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like 25,000 or 250,000,
I think, PBMs or something like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: 25,000, 250,000 PBMs or something of an
enzyme called, what is the enzyme called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me think of what the enzyme is called.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super powerful and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take these soap nuts and you can take
these soap nuts and it's just like a
[SPEAKER_03]: little shell.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're broken up and you take a few of
them, grind them up and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the powder in the water and stuff like
that and bubble it and watch how much it
[SPEAKER_03]: bubbles up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saponins, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The enzyme is saponins.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 25% saponins.
[SPEAKER_03]: This little nut is 25% saponins.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to think how many saponins you
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you do two to one caranginine and
then you do saponins with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit will come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You spray it out of an automizer if you've
got a pretty big garden or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you spray it out of a
normal spray or what it'll do,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you spray it out of an automizer and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit will foam up so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like foam covering all your plants
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing live in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soap nuts, so you just take the soap nut
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bubble the soap nuts for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the soap nut water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be real nice and bubbled up and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll bubble up like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The saponins will be going crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take that water, you pour that water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a gallon, do two gallons, whatever you
want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then do your neem and caranja with that
and then put some silica in there if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want, but you don't really need it because
everything's going to be nice and mixed up
[SPEAKER_03]: with those soap nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to mix everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's two things and it'll just go crazy
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me pictures of your process making it
next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see how you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you let me post them, we'll put them
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys check out Frosty's Instagram and
you can see how he does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put them up there so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the listeners to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a million different things you can
do organically and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coconut water and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insect frass actually even kills bugs and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just too much nutrients, too much enzymes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be thrown up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just making the bugs stick to their
stomach.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also like to just get away from it
because it's just like bug shit and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, there's some other bugs
over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they see all those carcasses and they
get scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I don't want to be there in
the landfill of dead bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Vlad the Impaler has been
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bought us a little bit more time
there if you saw me pushing buttons on the
[SPEAKER_04]: phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done cover crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else are you doing for pest
management?
[SPEAKER_04]: When you were mixing up, we had Sean on
the show a while back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said to put the neem and the caranja
meal in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you do that or no?
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I put neem and caranja meal in the
soil for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The neem and the caranja oil is a little
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I blend it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I'm getting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm putting it in a small little container
with some warm water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm blending all that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting really nice and mixed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns into a real nice white mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm pouring that into my water,
into my few gallons and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just getting it real nice and mixed up
with stuff like that with a blender and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just doing my own shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just using a little ninja.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting that thing all crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put neem and caranja meal, neem and
caranja cake more or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put neem and caranja cake on as a top
dressing for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelp and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It builds the fungi so quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll just see the mycelium just
building.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that white fur going.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you are growing organics or
no-till or super soil, when you see that
[SPEAKER_04]: white fuzz, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like to be like, oh, it's moldy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's what you're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That white powder is the start of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got your shit growing on the dirt,
you're going to grow good shit from your
[SPEAKER_04]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't get scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't understand what's happening,
and they get scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they throw their shit away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it happen a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I got to throw that shit
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go dig through wherever their
dirt is and get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that dirt, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just tossed it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some common problems that people
are going to run into if they try to start
[SPEAKER_04]: a no-till garden?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the basic first issues these guys
are going to run into?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think trying to do too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people come in, and if you've
grown any other way, even if you haven't,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just like you're going to take
pointers probably from people that have
[SPEAKER_03]: grown with bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even if they've grown organically with
bottles or something like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: or super soils, you're constantly having
to do something to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You constantly have to do something to the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave them alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of like what would happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always talk about how Kush came from a
mountain in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got pissed on by a goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just leave it alone, and the goat will
come piss on it, and it'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's in that soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do apologize for the little flyer bugs
that are around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're everywhere around here right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, they're extra strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you guys smoked that joint,
those little bugs came flying around you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Means you have a lot of organic shit in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Bokashi bucket within sight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have these at my house too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're everywhere right now in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go to a house without them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're frustrating when you're trying to
dab into the podcast and fly in your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching Dr. Piff over here slap him
out of the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said your name a few times a couple of
minutes ago, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote down the times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need to edit out your real name?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I wrote it down just in case we
needed to go cut you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our buddy Frosty got high and spilled the
beans over here, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spilled the fucking beans on your name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to try to do too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: The easy way to solve that is just leave
them alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, they're cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to do something, do some
supercropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop the stems a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens in veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Defoliate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see everybody water too much or do
something in veg and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just fucks their plants up and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you got to do in veg and stuff like
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Water one time a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch how moist and wet that soil is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got mulch on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much happening and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the least, you're going to have a
10-gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to do 15-gallon stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, the pots that I kept and stuff
like that, we have more 15-gallons than we
[SPEAKER_03]: do tins.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of 15-gallon stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going hard, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You lift up the mulch and you see so much
life, so many worms, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't put these worms in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about keeping the life in the pots?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about people running into problems
with their life leaving the pots?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, again, it's just people trying to
do too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: People try and get in and want to do these
mega teas and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the plant needs a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to do these neem and kelp
teas constantly and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you need to do neem and kelp teas
every once in a while and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to do a few compost teas,
but chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let these things breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let this ecosystem eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is someone going to know that the
inside of that ecosystem has gone to shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they going to be able to tell?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think your plant will just be having
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not growing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be going deficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see yellowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll get crunchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll get droopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do for cow mag in this
situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: See, you don't need calcium and magnesium
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cow mag and stuff like that is coming
from all, I guess, the trace minerals and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that come from the neem and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of calcium.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of trace minerals all
through there and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're getting a lot of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to look more into where I am
getting the calcium and the magnesium for
[SPEAKER_03]: my plants, but they're going hard,
man, and they stay green.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to ask questions if they
look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never see a cow mag deficiency at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't see no deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I see is sometimes if a
plant's directly under a light,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it wants more food.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, what I do is I don't do a lot of teas
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to do a lot of teas to
feed their soil and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Patrick sees me do and what Patrick
helps me do is we do a lot of top dressing
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let the ecosystem break it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to make a tea and bypass
the ecosystem, the ecosystem's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: leave or go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck do they need to be there
for?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're over here doing it correctly
and saying, okay, let me figure out how
[SPEAKER_03]: much they need, how much each plant needs,
top dress them, let the eco system come
[SPEAKER_03]: see what that is, they're like,
oh, nice, we like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they break it down and they can use
it correctly and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can break it down correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit trying to bypass them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your ecosystem's going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does your ecosystem need to be there
for if you're going to be the ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it work itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you set up no-till pots for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop doing teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop doing all these teas and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, you heard it from Frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty knows what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen his products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that gorilla glue you used to
grow, man, was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some coming down here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to come bless you with some.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say we're going to have to
do another show because I know this is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to spark questions from a lot of
listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be like, well,
that was a good warm-up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want six or seven more shows out of
that, Kat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are both welcome back all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your area of expertise,
my friend?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this guy is the no-till guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been in contact with a lot of
growers from a young age.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would consider myself more of an
agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to represent people that I
believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I really got into cannabis on
the business end of the deal, I just
[SPEAKER_02]: really liked quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know exactly what made it super
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I knew there was a difference between
your average pot and some super chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always had this one for one in the
business end of the deal to figure out who
[SPEAKER_02]: and how you ended up with super chronic
weed versus just your average Joe pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been blessed to be around and
fortunate to be around the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been enlightened by.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a blessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're glad to have you here on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like you're learning a lot from this
guy too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to put you on the right path.
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust him with my garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like good vibes in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the good vibes in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have the right people and the
right movements in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to make things different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want no negativity in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, today I listened to Spearhead in the
garden all day just to keep it positive
[SPEAKER_04]: and keep it moving.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Franti and Spearhead.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy how much they love music,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They feed off of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to think about, like if I have a
meeting with the bosses or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't go in the grow for a few minutes
after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to keep all the investors or
owners or whoever out of those kinds of,
[SPEAKER_04]: just keep them away from the plants a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just go to one area and you can see
the buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need you coming in here and
putting your Babylon all over my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just let them grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you try and touch every single plant
every day?
[SPEAKER_03]: I try and touch every single plant every
single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure it's a lot harder being in
a ... We have an auto water system that
[SPEAKER_04]: waters rose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walk and walk the rose and look at every
sprinkler every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I'm walking, I got my hands out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't think of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell if your grow room is too hot
or too cold by reaching out and squeezing
[SPEAKER_04]: your plants and seeing if they're too hot
or too cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever check your baby, you just put
your hand on your kid's forehead or on his
[SPEAKER_04]: butt and be like, no, you're fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a sweater.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If those plants feel cold to your hands,
the plants are probably cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably ain't eating.
[SPEAKER_03]: See those lowers going like this and the
uppers are like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spending their whole day trying to keep
themselves warm and getting skinny because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're burning calories, not doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasting carbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, we've gone for about 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else you feel like you
need to talk about in no-till gardening
[SPEAKER_04]: before we turn this into a dab off and
just a giggle fest with a bunch of bros?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I would just say veg in your no-till
pots or veg in your beds or however you
[SPEAKER_03]: can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm not doing beds right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just easier for me to have,
I guess, a space to veg and then a space
[SPEAKER_03]: to flower and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the future and stuff like that,
I want to veg in different rooms and
[SPEAKER_03]: flower in different rooms, stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I get more space and stuff like
that, it's just now you got to get out of
[SPEAKER_03]: town to be able to stay compliant with
your plant count and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be in residential, so I'm trying
to move out of town and trying to get into
[SPEAKER_03]: some agricultural or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'll just rent a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about just getting a
warehouse or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just staying compliant and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to grow my medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go buy some bullshit from
somebody that grows some ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few no-till places that grow
some pot here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few no-till places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll say some of them grow some decent
pot, and some of them grow some supreme
[SPEAKER_03]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people grow some.
[SPEAKER_02]: The no-till growers out here are
definitely doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say a sin is growing some supreme
pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say Verde is doing more of a
living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not no-till, but they're
reamending the soil and just doing their
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Verde is very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Chuck the Lemon Man still behind Verde?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're killing it, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing good and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a few other no-till places,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's subpar and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they're spraying too late.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they're spraying oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they just don't smoke correctly
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say any names,
but people need to appreciate really what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're doing with the plant and stuff
like that, and really think about the
[SPEAKER_03]: people and stuff like that, and think
about having a superior product.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're having my problems or having to
spray late in flowers, and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, crazy late in flower, you're doing
things incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a spray isn't the solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Solving the problem is the solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a better reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get a weird bump on your face
because you have a bump on your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a weird bump on your face because
you ate too much sugar, or you got cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to research a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to stop eating the sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get rid of the cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the bump's going to come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mites are going to keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to keep happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a medium-sized dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of you guys, feel free to pitch
yourself shamelessly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was good, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one looked a lot better than the
other one you took, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually grown at Three Rivers by
myself and my crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff's over there killing it over there at
Three Rivers right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If y'all come through the Pueblo,
Colorado area, I would say go to Three
[SPEAKER_03]: Rivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really have many places I hear
that have any superiors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Superior pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jeff grows some good pot, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go check out his pictures on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that good old fire that he'd
be growing right there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the Instagram plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's iry underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I just took a dab of was Berry
Cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Brian Berry cough mixed with Ecto
Cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that Ecto Cooler's fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ecto Cooler's so fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it turn like magenta and shit like
that for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes magenta and black and purple,
and yeah, it makes colors, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a colorful one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you post that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love her.
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks like Caliweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite of your hybrids that
you've created thus far?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody asked me a question similar to
that the other day, and my favorites,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably whatever I haven't grown yet that
I've got seeds of, those are always just
[SPEAKER_04]: the new one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever I'm about to germinate next,
that's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, there's some stuff I've bred
that's never been grown, like Chem 4 to
[SPEAKER_04]: Arise and Platinum Tangy to Arise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Flash to Arise.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit's never been grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are about nine strains that have
never even been spoken of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Platinum Tangy to Arise sounds pretty ...
It's Spence's from Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a good extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Platinum Cookies to the Tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Spence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, shout out to the family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Chem 4, there's a lot of good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannodential to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of good stuff in my vault
that's never been ... You've been killing
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arise wants to put pollen on everything,
and then I'm kind of working on another
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding project here pretty soon that
we'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the future, I want to get it a little
more underway and secure it before I brag
[SPEAKER_03]: about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get some ivory back in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some ... What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That Cookie Stomper that you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The King Cookie Stomper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some good ones of those for a while
and stuff like that, but we ended up
[SPEAKER_03]: letting them go, just bringing in so many
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that before we went over to no-till?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think I did that no-till maybe once
or twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one or two times, but I was still
doing some super soils and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super soil is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to really be feeding enzymes
like fucking constantly just to speed up
[SPEAKER_03]: decomposition because there's no
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing eating it for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to break down slowly by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to feed a lot of microbes and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: His soil is so far along right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of not comparable to early
beginning stages of no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: His pots are taking care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're super far along.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the last time you were here,
you said you were on round six or seven of
[SPEAKER_04]: your no-till pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how long it's been, and it's been
quite a while since we were here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the same dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some rounds that are super far in
the ... Yeah, it's probably the same dirt
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even top dressing stuff a lot and stuff
like that, and transplant and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be like, man, there's a lot of dirt
up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of mulch and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: These pots are overflowing and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you know it, then things are broken
down and shit like that, and they're back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the pot and stuff.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crops grow into the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have to constantly cut it and
stuff like that, trying to grow with the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you've got room to germinate seeds,
man, you let me know, and I'll give you
[SPEAKER_04]: what my newest, hottest shit is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make sure you get the fresh fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That new new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would like to find some good
keepers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just bring me a clone,
and we'll keep it going forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to do a little fake,
a little few crosses of my own and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to do some few branches and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know if you need advice,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would even like some pollen or something
like that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can just hit a few branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a plant out, hit a few branches and
stuff like that, spray it down and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, and put it back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you got to do, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get those few branches and stuff like
that, or those seeds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get that good pollen as the hard
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like some good pollen if young
Jeff wanted to be jolly about some.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there may be some iry frost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Collabs here in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that would be lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some frozen mountain genetics or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I brought that glue out here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that Gorilla Glue from some guys
that literally knew Josie Wells in the
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain Nevada back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy Garrett gave it to me back in
college.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about we had this thing like
2010, 2011, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kept this Gorilla Glue this long,
so you can talk about how long that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've had my flow cut since I think
2008 or seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that Colorado flow, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have some booth flows and
shit now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where all these poopy ass
bullshit flows came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like something sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the one that's real sister?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people have that,
and it's just like they're calling it
[SPEAKER_03]: flow, and it's just not the flow,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Colorado flow almost gives you like
an indica high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real sweet and real fucking like a
real sweet Tardo G type incense and hippie
[SPEAKER_04]: feet kind of a smell going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not like like a like a piney like
kind of has a piney next to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about it that I do not
like, and there's also plenty of things I
[SPEAKER_04]: do like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember like I had the Colorado flow
way back in the day a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might have came from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably came from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I smoked it with Spencer
and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I shared that cut a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it makes such great clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fucking you cut it and it's got
roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: It yields really well too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it's easy to grow and it turns
purple and stinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, leafy as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, leafy as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, yeah, I'll be can I'll be
callous nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trimming on my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop me and my lady and you know,
young piff over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just like, I'm trying to grow some
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of new age genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, you know, I mean,
we got some orange cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got some solid like, oh,
geez, that are definitely staples stones
[SPEAKER_02]: that will never be old.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got a we got some like,
orange cream and the white Tahoe cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: and the papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like some stuff that is just like,
really sought after, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like terpene wise, and I guess nugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear a lot about the papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't have any experience with the
papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll shoot you the papaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, go ahead and throw that on the
motherfucking air real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll shoot Jeff the papaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the papaya in house bitches.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you call a rise to papaya?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the new question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It throws like so even in the notes and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's the thing that I found out
with no tills, you know, it allows the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants to really express all their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were talking earlier before we
recorded there's a certain nutrient brand
[SPEAKER_04]: that if you feed your plants that nutrient
brand, if you grow 10 strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: it looks like you grew one strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, you want that and
it's equivalent with the high I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it transitions hand for hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you when you smoke no till you I
mean, if you're smoking something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to wreck you, you're going to get
wrecked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like there's a ceiling on it
like that you top out and keep getting
[SPEAKER_02]: higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like you're just gonna keep getting
stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just more pure that that one
time whenever you said that there was all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of trichomes caked on the weed like
extra caked on the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think whenever y'all use these
synthetics and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: or even just like, you know, organic
synthetics or whatever, just a bottle
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that, that is a synthesized
nutrient, I think it's building calyxes so
[SPEAKER_03]: big, and it's building trichomes so big,
like these trichomes, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's good for extra like that
you're getting huge trichomes like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we aren't getting as big of
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're getting more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just caked up like it's just like a
whole bunch of little fire ass trichomes
[SPEAKER_03]: just caked up more natural type of like
trichomes stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say our turps are more, you know,
prevalent than any type of bottle and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that, like definitely so
especially when you get it down into bag
[SPEAKER_02]: form, not even not even an extract form
that that for sure is probably definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: so but when you get it down to a bag form,
I think soil grown weed is just so much
[SPEAKER_02]: louder like it finds your nose versus you
going to find the smell turps for days,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we all love the turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what it's all about nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the turps are what drive the high
the THC makes you go up and the turps
[SPEAKER_04]: decide how you're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get the munchies,
you're going to get a high high,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to get paranoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all about them turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going for close to an hour
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys again for coming
and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's remind everybody how they can find
you on social media over here.

frosty and you're trying to get get a hold
[SPEAKER_02]: of product, just be patient.

that really are going to enjoy it are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, just be patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be out there everywhere pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be everywhere pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know what's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys for coming to
join me and taking some.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We smoked some joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird to have a guest that doesn't
come take dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for showing up with dank ass
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some beautiful purple trichome laden
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_01]: We can use a little soul shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little soul shine.
A little soul shine.
A little soul shine.
