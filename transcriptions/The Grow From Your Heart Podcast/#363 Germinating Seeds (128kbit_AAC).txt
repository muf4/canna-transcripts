[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 363 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the episodes off by
letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished the last dab of the Orange
Skittles Ambrosia that left a nice orange
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor in my mouth, gave me a nice head
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I followed that up with the last dab of
the Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuego Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combo made me super rambly and gave me
a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I'm doing a long series of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been following along,
I suggest you go back to episode 351 and
[SPEAKER_00]: start there and get caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a solid foundation on
planning your grow and getting prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know that we've selected our space,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've selected our equipment, we've done a
lot of talk about genetics, and now this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is going to be about sprouting our
new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time,
let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds can be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on who you ordered them from,
how many you bought, what kind you
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased, you may have spent a lot of
money on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you think about germinating your
new seeds, I highly recommend you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg area ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you even think about starting your
seeds, you're going to think, oh I can
[SPEAKER_00]: just germinate these seeds and then I'll
build up this veg room in the next couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of days, and then while they veg,
I'll work on the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get plants going, you start time
traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things go so much more quickly than you
anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things pop up, things get in your way,
then you fall behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds you just paid a bunch of
money for start growing funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get out of control, and you've got
shitty plants to start with, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you germinate your seeds,
have your veg space prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my very first piece of advice to
you that will save you a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my second piece of advice is to start
with quality seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get your seeds from a reputable
vendor and also from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for hype when you're shopping
for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find somebody with a good
reputation, somebody that you have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of, and also try to buy those seeds from a
vendor with a good reputation,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that you have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that has a good relationship with
the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to buy seeds online,
I recommend you buy from a seed vendor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have to risk customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I recommend the Hella Dank Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend the Seed Bazaar,
and I can also vouch for Southern Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three quality seed vendors that
I trust and respect, and I work with them
[SPEAKER_00]: personally, so I know they will take good
care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not bashing any other seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying I rely on these three
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a relationship with them,
and I know they are rock solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend you start with a quality
seed, something you know what the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: of that seed were, something you know
where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have access to fancy labeled
expensive seeds, grow what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an ideal world, we would all go to the
store, and we'd look at the shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd say, you've got that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that that's everybody's fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we are not there yet
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, some people are going to have
to be resourceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have bought a bag of weed 10 years
ago at some random place, and it had seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have to grow those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you're going to get
out of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find the next magical strain in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where your seeds come from,
whether they're regular, whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds, pay close attention to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to keep an eye out when
you're growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you've got a bag of seeds lying
around and you don't know what any of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are, it's just a perhaps a sandwich bag or
a little mason jar just stuffed with
[SPEAKER_00]: random seeds from bags of cannabis you've
gone through over time, and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: decide what to grow, I go for the really
healthy looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by healthy, I mean probably darker,
probably bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like the tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seeds will not make tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how long they grow, no matter
how mature, no matter how healthy and
[SPEAKER_00]: strong they are, they just won't stripe
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a genetic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the darker colored seeds,
the harder seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them a little press on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they don't crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't crack, that's probably a
good seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it cracks, it obviously isn't gonna
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dead seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like a larger cannabis
seed, but I've noticed that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains produce little tiny seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes a little tiny cannabis seed
can produce a seriously potent plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't judge it too much by the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judge it more by the health of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the grayer, light colored seeds
will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put those in my packs because
people freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow those myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those lighter gray, the paler colored
seeds, those will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white seeds, those are more
questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the white seeds do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray kind of silver sheeny seeds,
those usually have a good takeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker ones, those take off quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course you get those bigger,
harder tiger stripe seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those really have a lot of vigor and they
take off really quickly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed health is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big bag of seeds,
try to select the healthiest looking beans
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a couple of them just call you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a bag of a thousand seeds
and two of them just go, hey bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the seeds you want to grow right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is usually accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got our veg space ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to look for in quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some seeds on hand and it is
time to germinate our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by germinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a fancy word for starting the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to give them the proper conditions
to make them start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to crack the seed open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to happen naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the seed to crack itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open and we want a little tiny taproot to
come fishing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the start of life in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds would fall out of last year's
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter would come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would knock those seeds at those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds would dry the wind and the
moisture would knock those seeds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds would fall into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter would come and everything would be
frozen for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the spring came and the winter frost or
the winter moisture started moistening
[SPEAKER_00]: down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds would begin to receive
moisture and warmth from nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would trigger them to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they would sprout up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would find their way up, dig up out
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd start seeing sun and they'd go,
here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would live and they would
become little baby cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with human involvement, what we've
done, we have collected the seeds before
[SPEAKER_00]: they fall out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I breed, I let the plants get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the seeds get finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut the plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I basically crumble up the buds and I
manually remove the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several methods of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not important right now,
but that process happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds were passed on to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to play the role of mother
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to give these seeds the proper
environment to trigger them to start their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two main things that are going to
start our seeds are water and warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing being water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warmth very secondary to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warmth will speed up the process and make
them much happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are countless ways to start new
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover four or five methods
here in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to start with the method I
use personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the old school paper towel
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a plate out of the cupboard,
just a glass plate like you'd serve a meal
[SPEAKER_00]: on or make a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also get a paper towel, just like you'd
use to clean up that meal or that
[SPEAKER_00]: sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fold the paper towel one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I fold it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've just got a little rectangular
paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set that paper towel onto the glass
plate and then I get a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer bottled water for this because I
don't want the chlorine or whatever else
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the folded paper towel sitting
on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply soak that paper towel with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will only hold so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply saturate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I tip the plate to the side to make
sure all that excess water runs out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel and off of that plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drain it right off into the sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a soggy paper towel in
the middle of a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I place my seeds in the paper towel and
then I gently fold it one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to fold it another time you
can and make a little tiny square,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that first fold will be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fold it up to where those seeds are
in the middle and they're getting wet and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not getting any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that that wet paper towel works,
it'll kind of seal itself up so the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: won't move around too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be any light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some seeds folded up in a
wet paper towel and those are sitting on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point, you've got a couple of
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are able to pay attention to those
seeds and be around them all the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they don't get dry, you can just
leave them on that plate and leave them
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not too hot or not too cold in
your area, they will sprout just fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: just left sitting like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to slow down the amount of
moisture leaving that paper towel and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it moist a little bit longer
without having to pay so much attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: just set another plate over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip the plate upside down and set it on
top of the first plate just like you'd do
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had a sandwich in there and you
didn't want anything to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got two plates with your
little folded up paper towel in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep it moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let it get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're going to get
forgetful or if you need to go to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: an extended period of time and you cannot
monitor the moisture of your new
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings, you can always set them in a
baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your folded paper towel with the
moisture in it in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give the moisture nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be trapped inside that little
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you check on them as soon
as you get home from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave that wet paper towel folded
up in a baggie in a really warm spot for
[SPEAKER_00]: too long, you can create a mildew
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you pop that open,
get some fresh air in there and check on
[SPEAKER_00]: that as soon as you get home from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds really easy because it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are folding a paper towel into a
square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're moistening it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're letting the excess moisture run
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set the seeds onto that moist paper
towel and then we fold it to cover them
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you need to place another
plate over it to slow down the dry time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're really forgetful and you're
going to be away for a while, put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: baggie to retain that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then set it somewhere semi warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, if you are comfortable
in that area, your seedlings are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room temperature is acceptable for
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great spot for seedlings if you do not
forget them is on top of the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That temperature that happens right on top
of the refrigerator is perfect for
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't forget them, put them in a
baggie, set them right on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be ready in 12 to 24,
maybe 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one of those old big TVs,
nobody's got those big old TVs anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to get warm on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great spot to set seedlings in
a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on the back of the old Sony
Trinitron 36 inch TV where it got warm
[SPEAKER_00]: from playing video games all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the perfect temp for
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than those subtle heat sources like
the top of the fridge or the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: TV, I really don't recommend a heat mat
for germinating new seeds or for your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen more clones and seeds destroyed,
roasted, and barbecued than I have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen assisted by one of those heat mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that more later in
the episode, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's skip that for now and try to stay
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are folded up in a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're keeping them moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them dripping all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep them moist and
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them folded in the paper towel
and you are checking on them every few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are able, they're easy to check on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set your hand right on that paper
towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't crush the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set your hand on there gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the paper towel is kind of cold,
kind of chilly, they're probably wet
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't feel like it's wet enough,
moisten it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your water bottle and just pour the
water on there gently and then tip the
[SPEAKER_00]: plate over toward the excess water runs
off into the sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got a moistened up for the
rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should only be in this paper towel
for 12 to 24, maybe 36 or 48 hours before
[SPEAKER_00]: you see them starting to pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will pop open on one side and a
little white tail will start coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what we are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the start of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the beginning of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little root is going to dig down into
the pot once we pot it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to dig down and start
finding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be the legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to start shooting that
seedling straight upward toward the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to shoot little leaves
out of there and that little seedling will
[SPEAKER_00]: fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got a little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the start of everything
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to see it because you've just
got it right there in that paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not buried under anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on them about 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see anything, check on them
in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see anything, go 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get impatient after 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be checking on them every four to
six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only need maybe an eighth of an inch,
maybe a quarter of an inch of that taproot
[SPEAKER_00]: to pop out before our seedlings are ready
to put into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered how to germinate
seeds in a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fold it, you wet it, you drain it,
put the seeds in there, fold it again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you keep an eye on it and keep it
moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it slightly warm, but don't roast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you might forget about your
seedlings, place the paper towel set up in
[SPEAKER_00]: a baggie and that will keep them moist
until you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, don't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you unfold that paper towel and
you've got little taproot sticking out,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when it's time to get ready to put
them into your potting mix, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about that a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing left to cover in this
section is what if those seeds don't pop
[SPEAKER_00]: open after 48 hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you can really do is wait a
little bit longer, maybe increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't already set them on the
fridge, maybe set them up there on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the refrigerator where it's a little
warmer, maybe lessen the moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got them a little too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just keep that paper towel just
damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've still got a little bit of a
chance, but if they haven't opened after
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 or 72 hours, I would consider starting
a fresh batch of seeds at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it is really cold in your
environment, it will take longer for your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in the basement in
Colorado, you've got them sitting right on
[SPEAKER_00]: a concrete floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, the warmth will speed
things up, but that too can go wrong in
[SPEAKER_00]: excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to stay in the right area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be about 70 to 85 degrees ish and
you should be okay with rapid growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about our next method for
sprouting our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next method is using rapid rooters or
root riots or whatever type of plugs are
[SPEAKER_00]: available in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I am not including rock wool
cubes in this section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like rock wool cubes for sprouting
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not work well for sprouting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's what you've got, do it similarly
to what I recommend here with the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before you use your rock wool cubes,
make sure you clean them out and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you soak them in a pH balanced solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse them very well to get anything out
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then soak them either in clean water or a
light nutrient solution that has been pH
[SPEAKER_00]: around six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to use rock wool cubes
without rinsing them and adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all about rapid rooters or root
riot plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start with these plugs,
we need to soak them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a container based on the amount
of plugs I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm generally using a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're sold in a 50 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time I just do all 50 and I
either do 50 clones or 50 seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use the whole package.
[SPEAKER_00]: You soak as many as you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I get a container that will
fit enough water to soak as many plugs as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I adjust the pH to somewhere between six
and six, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually place the rapid rooter plugs
back into the rapid rooter tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using the tray, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need it, but that's usually what
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it right in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take a seed and I insert the seed
into the rapid rooter plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed goes pointy and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at your seeds, it's got a
round end and it's got a pointy end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be obvious when you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pointy end goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because of the way that
the seed grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pointy and down when you're putting it
into a rapid rooter or any sort of a cube
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're going directly into soil,
pointy and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are going into a rapid
rooter, if you're going into a root riot
[SPEAKER_00]: cube, if you're going into soil,
or if you're going against my advice and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going directly into rockwool,
it is always suggested that you plant your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds about one knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go just the tip of your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push it in until you press that first
knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that first bend in your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's far enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seedling is deep enough into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deep enough into that cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to be buried way down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands a much better chance if it's
just about knuckle deep is all you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've got all my seedlings planted
and I've got all my cubes labeled,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you label each cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're planting different strains,
make sure you've got a way to label each
[SPEAKER_00]: cube so you know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also label.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing more than one paper towel
of seeds, make sure you label that paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towel some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you are just doing one pack of
seeds or one strain, but if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple, please carefully label things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in our rapid rooter cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are carefully labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are nice and moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are about knuckle deep down into the
cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I place them under a very light light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need very powerful lighting for
sprouting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really weak LED or a T five kind of high
up is plenty of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A compact fluorescent is probably just
enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to go extreme for a
ceiling, just enough to encourage it to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets bigger, we do need light,
but right now we don't need ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting for a small ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So place it under a light that will give
it warmth and that will encourage it to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in about two or three days,
maybe four or five days at the latest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should see a little sprout pop out of
your cube and you have now got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that seedling can live in that little
rapid rooter for several days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to need a forever home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need to go into either some
soil or a hydro setup fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's in that rapid rooter,
we need to keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep it somewhere between 70
and 85 degrees and we need to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: root cube moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it dries up, that plant has no life
source and it will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it moist and keep it warm and keep
it under a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to think about getting it
into a good potting mix or into a hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: system very soon so that it can thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the basics of sprouting a seed
in a rapid rooter or a root riot cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or against my advice, if you choose to use
a Rockwell cube, you would use a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically soak it with the proper pH
solution, then press the seedling in,
[SPEAKER_00]: pointy in down and only go about a knuckle
deep, set it under a light and leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: alone for two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see a little sprout pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see the sprout pop up,
look in the little hole and see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the seedling simply gets caught
and it's bent over and it can't pop itself
[SPEAKER_00]: up out of the root cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can carefully get a pair of tweezers
or a chopstick and very gently encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant to grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull it out of the seed casing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull it out of the cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe spread the hole of the cube open
just a little bit and encourage it to pop
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just needs to bend up and come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably guide it out if you're
gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's close to doing it on its own,
don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it struggle and it will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like it's been long enough and
you're getting impatient, just give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may pop out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you're risking killing this
seedling if you get too rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to destroy it if you get too
rough, but you've got a good chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use your thumbs and spread that rapid
rooter open just a little tiny bit and you
[SPEAKER_00]: may open it just enough for that seed to
unbind itself and be able to pop straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just be stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to move up and the two leaves
on the top, they just got stuck somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens quite a bit and it'll just
have to break itself free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that if it doesn't pop
up in four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the others have popped up and you've
got one that didn't pop up, look in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be the issue with that one
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's kind of touch on another method
that is very similar to the rapid rooters
[SPEAKER_00]: and the root riot cubes, but it is also
very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next method, you cannot put this into
a hydro kit as simply as you could a rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooter or as simply as you could a seed
from a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people do it, but it's not
as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more challenging and it's not as
logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about using Jiffy cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jiffy cubes are great if you're going to
go into soil, but like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really use them going into a
hydro system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's somebody doing it going
to tell me I'm wrong, but it's not common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a Jiffy cube, they're very similar to
the rapid rooters, but they start off
[SPEAKER_00]: really small and you moisten them and they
expand to the proper size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you moisten them, they puff up,
you squeeze the excess water out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, they work just like the
rapid rooters or the root riot cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You place your seedling in there,
pointy in down, you go about knuckle deep,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you've got to keep your Jiffy
cube moist just like you do with your
[SPEAKER_00]: other cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're using rapid rooters or root
riots, or Jiffy cubes, or if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: against my advice still and using the
rockwool cubes, make sure not to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: too moist for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are too moist, it will simply rot
your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will turn green, they will turn
brown, they will fall over and die,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they will not even germinate at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big difference between being
soaked and being wet and being moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to soak them in the beginning,
put the seeds in there when they are
[SPEAKER_00]: soaked, then just keep it wet from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can usually tell by looking at the
rapid rooters how dry or wet they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start getting that brown crusty
color, they're too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start getting that sheen to
them, they start showing a little silver,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little light reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're really, really black,
that's when they are soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn how to identify soaked and
saturated and wet and moist and create a
[SPEAKER_00]: little scale for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the one through five watering
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need a similar thing for the
rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're totally soaked and black,
that's a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're dry and crispy, that's a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep them about a three at all
times, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go, one through five tech on
rapid rooters, just like we did on
[SPEAKER_00]: watering normal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know how to germinate seeds in
paper towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to germinate seeds in rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of know how to do it in rockwool
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to germinate seeds in Jiffy
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just like doing it in the rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you moisten them, they expand,
you squeeze the excess water out of there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you treat it just like it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rapid rooter from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next option is to plant our seedlings
directly into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't we do that in our personal
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about planting
our seeds directly into soil or the medium
[SPEAKER_00]: we are going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan to start your seedling in
soil, I highly recommend you use a very
[SPEAKER_00]: small container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a beer cup or something
that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to have a tiny,
tiny plant in a large container of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first recommendation is a small
container with plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second recommendation will be a good
soil for starter plants, something with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of aeration and something with not too
much nutrients added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something with some mycos or maybe
some beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, but we don't need a lot of
boosts for our little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start with a small container of high
quality starter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my container and I've got my
starter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I moisten that soil before I put my
seedlings into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply water that soil with a pH
adjusted solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need nutrients, just water pH
around six to six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water it on in, let it drain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's done draining, take your pointer
finger and just make a little tiny hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just knuckle deep, just like I keep saying
in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may name the episode that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go about one knuckle deep into the
soil, then take your seedling and just set
[SPEAKER_00]: it right inside that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then gently press the dirt right over that
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just real gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cover up that ceiling and then just
let it rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within 24 to 48 to 36,
maybe 72 hours, you should see a little
[SPEAKER_00]: baby plant just popping up right out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just see two little green leaves
just popping right up out of that top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep my little baby plants in
the beer cups under a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep the light kind of far when
they're little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they get bigger, I move the
light a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to let the seedlings get too
stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start getting a little leggy,
I move the light closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put a fan on them while they're
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives them a little strength,
makes them a little more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are advantages and disadvantages
to starting them in the beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage, they're already in their
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to up-pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to transplant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do any damage to a
little seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages, sometimes you just
completely lose a seedling in a beer cup
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they just totally disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't sprout at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you totally drown them by
trying to water so much soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting them in beer cups and soil is
a little trickier, but it may be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: option for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody is able to order rapid
rooters or root riot cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has access to a rock wool
cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people may just want to try it
because that's the way it happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a rundown of my basic methods
of germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully one of those methods works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I use the folded paper towel
method the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I may use the
rapid rooter method next, but I honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: do not start seeds directly in soil
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that I can start a lot more and
much less space by using the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the amount of space it takes to
start 100 rapid rooters compared to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large difference in the amount of
space that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have any experience with
the Jiffy cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had to use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had access to the rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I've just been sticking with
the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm doing the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to use the method that
works the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you also to try different
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think something works great,
why not try another method?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some seeds that you can
spare, why not try something?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find that something works better
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now we've got our seeds
germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have either got some seeds folded into
a paper towel or we've got a rapid rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a root riot or a rock wall cube with
roots hanging out of the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: root cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next step is to pot our new seedling
into a pot of soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I will cover how to pot
the seeds germinated from a paper towel
[SPEAKER_00]: into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my next episode is going to be about
cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then shortly after that, we will have to
pop the clones into soil, which means I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do a combo episode of planting
our new seedlings in the rapid rooters and
[SPEAKER_00]: planting clones in rapid rooters into soil
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to knock that out in one
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part will be coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, let's talk about planting our
freshly germinated seedlings that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in a wet paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to catch these seeds when the new
tap roots are very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to get it too long and too
out of control because I feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me too much opportunity to cause it
too much strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I see my seedlings crack
open a little bit and that little tap root
[SPEAKER_00]: is sticking out just a little tiny bit,
I'm comfortable putting them into their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do that with a very similar method
as I did earlier when we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: planting seeds into the beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a beer cup or a very small pot with
plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill it with a quality soil that is good
for small plants, something with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration and plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I moisten that soil with water pH
around six to six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do the same thing as we've been
doing the whole episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a little tiny hole about knuckle
deep in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I simply place the germinated seed in
that little hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to point it with that little
white root pointing straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your tap root is nice and short,
don't worry about which direction your
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling is facing when you place it into
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really long, you may want to make
sure you point that root down and the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gently place your seedling in the soil,
brush dirt over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to bury it or pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cover it and then the tap root will
go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start to spread out and the little
tiny plant will grow up to the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll push the seedling with a little set
of tiny tiny leaves right through the top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and you'll have a little starter baby
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing to worry about when potting
your new seedlings is to not damage that
[SPEAKER_00]: little white tap root sticking out of the
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best not to disrupt, stress or
damage that little white tap root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I've got it potted, I put it under
a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the light a little distance away so
that I don't shock the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant gets bigger, I bring the
light a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I feel like the plant has kind of
taken off, I put a fan on it and then once
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets its first set of serrated leaves,
I start adding very light doses of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how I pot my seedling that was
germinated from a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically fill a beer cup with good
dirt, poke a hole in the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: go knuckle deep in the soil in the top,
drop my little germinated seedling in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and cover it up and then put it
under the light and wait for it to pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it grows and grows until I see a
set of leaves with serration and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: when I start feeding it a little bit of
light nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a couple of things
that happen quite often when we are
[SPEAKER_00]: working with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the seed shell will get stuck to
the seed and hinder the seed's growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: threaten that seed's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not as scary as it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it happens, you'll know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed hole will just get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedling will come up out of the dirt
and you'll see that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are trying to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to live and it's just trying
to open up but it can't because that seed
[SPEAKER_00]: casing is just stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really easy to solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a spray bottle with water and I
moisten that seedling really heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spray it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep spraying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More moisture, more moisture, more
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, see if you can just brush it off
with your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just come right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, spray more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that still doesn't work, get some
tweezers and just do a gentle dissection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is really moist, you should be able
to get that seed casing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is supposed to come off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the plant opens itself up,
the way that that seed casing spreads in
[SPEAKER_00]: half, it should pop right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a little assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little moisture, little tweezers,
maybe a pair of chopsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how skilled you are,
it shouldn't be too hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to get in there and pull
that casing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, I talked about not using heat
mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have honestly seen people roast more
seeds with heat mats than I have ever seen
[SPEAKER_00]: success with a heat mat from a seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I have ever needed a heat
mat was when I was growing in a warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado and it was really cold during
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, I don't use a heat mat for
cloning or for seedlings and I have great
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are comfortable in the area,
your seedlings are probably comfortable in
[SPEAKER_00]: that area also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about some Colorado
mountain boy who's outside barefoot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about a normal person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room temperature is acceptable for your
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I want to touch on
before I start wrapping up the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The note I wrote is called pre-soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to pre-soak their
seeds before the official germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got older seeds that have been
sitting around for longer, I may recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you give them a pre-soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply pre-soak them in water before
you germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend 12 hours, maybe 24 at the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never go more than 24 hours on a soak
because that will drown your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory behind the pre-soak is some
seeds just have a hard outer coating and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to germinate very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soaking them in water for 24 hours will
definitely soften that outer coating and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage easier germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got older seeds that you've been
having a problem getting to germinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe soak them for 12 hours, then give
them the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work, try soaking some for
24 hours, then giving them the paper towel
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work, then we're going to
need to try more scientific approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chemicals we can add.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tricks we can do, but that is
much more advanced science than what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got old seeds or if you feel
like you've got really hard seeds with a
[SPEAKER_00]: really thick coating, don't be afraid to
give them a pre-soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 to 24 hours, never go more than 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is a good lesson on how
to germinate your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not forget to teach you guys how to
pot those freshly sprouted seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got in your rapid rooters or your
rockwool cubes, like I told you not to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in your Jiffy pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is on the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want to thank you for
listening to another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to encourage you guys to support
