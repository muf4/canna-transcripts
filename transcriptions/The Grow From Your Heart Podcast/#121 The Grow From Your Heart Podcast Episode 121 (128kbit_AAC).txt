[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 121 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to give a huge shout out to my
friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman Glass, when I buy a new rig,
I like to buy something made in America by
[SPEAKER_01]: an American, and that's why I support
Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for a new piece,
I recommend you check out www.hitmanglass
[SPEAKER_01]: .com and let them know you're listening to
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in California this summer,
make sure you support the Chalice
[SPEAKER_01]: Festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash, music, glass, and art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is a great episode,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: My good buddy Rob from Sour Seeds dropped
by, and we talk about selecting a male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to let the music play for a
couple of seconds, and when we come back,
[SPEAKER_01]: our good buddy Rob and I will be sitting
at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am back with our good friend Rob from
Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing tonight, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude, thanks for coming, taking the
time out of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both busy cats, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a lot of things on your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You looking forward to the Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be the first time we've spoke
about this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cannabis Cup that was planned for
Denver over the 420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver said no, they did not issue the
permits that were needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Time's response was to move the
Cannabis Cup to Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo-hoo!
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is our location.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my town.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where this podcast is recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter where the podcast lands in
Pueblo, it will be 20 minutes from my
[SPEAKER_01]: house at maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a whole bunch of cool
people around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a whole bunch of cool
shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to get a whole bunch of cool
people on the podcast since it's nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can either come here and record in
the kitchen slash studio podcast setup,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I've got a portable unit we'll take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we get a whole bunch of cool
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to come, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people seem to be talking shit on
Facebook about Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo!
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people that are talking shit have
never been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Florida and I love it here,
so that tells you something right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I landed here because of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I landed here because of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got here, I visited Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visited Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went south, Walsenburg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been all over for being here a short
amount of time in three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice, humble town.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to know the people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver's too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Springs is kind of a military vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a high crime too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in Springs now and I see a lot of
wonky shit on my breaks, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some strange shit happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just watch the crazy ass local news,
man, and it's always going down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are a couple of parts of
Pueblo that I would not go to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the most part, this place is not
that bad, you guys, so come hang out at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour Seeds should have a booth out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I'll be running around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not do a booth this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have an irie genetics t-shirt on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be running around, having a good
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long ways away, but we're stoked
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cannabis Cup is coming to Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come see us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a lot of fun,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, so we're going to do a
little show about breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to do a show about selecting a
male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, we're both coughing over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob's smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: What strain are you smoking on,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably some tut in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: The King Tut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells kind of ... It's got a unique
smell, a very unique smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how to describe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost reminded me of a specific
terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember which one we decided it
smelled like anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with an L.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linolule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linolule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linolule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the heads up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never remember the name of Linolule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always the one that I forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: That herb smells like it's got a lot of
Linolule in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're choking over here because
we're getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking some Terpex Sour Death Star
Wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Terpex crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to do a podcast
about selecting a male plant for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to breed some seeds,
there are a few things to look for in a
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you buy yourself a 10-pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do it two 10-packs if you're
trying to do a phenohunt to find a male,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not everybody's got the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to do at least two 10-packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's power in numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're phenohunting, the more plants,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 to 50 is a good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can usually find super plants in 20 to
50, just astounding keepers that stand
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't do that many at a time,
just do them in phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do 10, find a keeper out of that 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do 10 more, find the best out of those 10,
and then you got two to stack up against
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep doing it until your room is full and
then start eliminating shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even sometimes I do it from seeds right
out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have those seeds that just look like
they're going to have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell whenever they open the shell,
they have the little tiny leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes they're mutated or doesn't look
as strong or vibrant as the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go ahead and chuck them right out
of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, as somebody who is ... I've
read a lot of plants, and if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for a male plant, you're going to
have to learn to get rid of some plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and not be too attached to your babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be ruthless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, be ruthless.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are little baby plants, and you are
creating the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do not pull those ugly little
fuckers, you are going to ruin and fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: up, and you're going to retard the
progression of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to water the genetics down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you are, and we don't want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're breeding to improve the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a plant, you start a bunch of
seeds, you got a couple that are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: wonky looking, you got one with the fucked
up leaf, don't be afraid to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they grow, keep a good eye on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to that part, let's talk
about what the male plant is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring to our breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we hit a male plant with pollen to a
female plant that accepts pollen that has
[SPEAKER_01]: pistols, it's going to create seeds that
are going to have traits of both plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the male mostly going to bring to
the table?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's going to bring a lot of
the pest resistance and a lot of the vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really a lot of what it is,
the hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that male side of the family,
you really can't catch that true hard
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people all the time,
you can't create Halle berries by
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminating half the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way you put that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will catch on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the male to bring that good
structure and the resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the flavor comes from
mama, it comes from the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking for structure and
shape, a lot of it is going to come from
[SPEAKER_01]: the boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can talk a little bit about what to
look for in a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're breeding a sativa, you're going
to want one that gets a little bit taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in veg, the males are always
going to start taking off a little taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their goal is to get above the females so
that when they pollinate, their pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: falls down onto the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're growing in veg, look for that
one that's taken off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be a boy for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a sativa, you want the one
that keeps not too tall and doesn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: off too much because you don't want to
make your progeny skyrocket immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost want to find what you want your
girls to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the boy to look the shape to be
what you want your females to look like,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want tight, close node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a whole bunch of gaps
between your branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it when a plant spits out
really long branches like Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to come right out of my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG family, the whole family over there
on that side, even Grape Stomper OG and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other ones that are hybrids,
most of them take off because of the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're saying, the structure,
it comes from the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Joseph male, the gauge uses everything
they cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That great male, by the way, but it comes
out tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time you get mostly dominant
phenotypes of stretchy plants because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stretchy, stretchy, with little popcorn
balls coming off everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dominant OG male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that structure taking over the
dominance from that male plant and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the OG dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cushions have always had that
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is an Afghan heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just trace back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recessive Afghan genes that are
really strong and they're always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come forward and breed true unless you
find a dominant gene from a different side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the family that breeds just as hard,
like something from Blue Dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good example of a good breeding parent,
or White Widow used to be a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred the White Widow with two other
strains and it does very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're doing at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking a diversity of genotypes
from different parts of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil, South America, things like that,
and then diversifying them against things
[SPEAKER_00]: like OG cushions, which are originally
derivative Afghan, places like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mostly purged into California,
East Coast, places with coastlines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the stuff that started off in the
Dutch genetics has those real thin leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was all bred for indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you see a lot of Brazilian
and Sativa genetics and then Nepal and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepalese genetics, Moroccan genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of Spain, a lot of Spanish
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you see an influx of that in
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to Gage Green
Genetics since we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape Snopper OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys finally took home a cannabis
cup for the Grape Snopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but love and respect for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gage Green, MK4, and Key Play,
the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They helped me get a little start in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for something that doesn't get too
tall, too crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for an indica,
if you're trying to breed an indica male,
[SPEAKER_01]: find the shortest, stoutest, squaddiest
one you can find, probably with those big,
[SPEAKER_01]: fattest leaves you can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dinner plate leaves, if you can camp
out under those leaves, if you can almost
[SPEAKER_01]: make a hammock under those leaves,
that'd be a sweet male to breed with if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for a nice indica plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something with nice, tight,
close-node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find a male plant, you got to
flower them out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to veg them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note their structure in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to get them too tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a clone off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label the clone that matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clone A to plant A, clone B to plant B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower your plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got females and you're looking
for males, you can just go ahead and toss
[SPEAKER_01]: the females, or you can finish them out
and have some buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take my male plants and flower them
all the way out to see what they do,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to like seven, eight,
maybe nine weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if they're going to produce
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if they're going to produce
a whole bunch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if they're just ... Some
plants will only produce a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, you can see which pollen
will be ... There's kind of grainy pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel like that pollen's worth a
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the pre-pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the pollen before your plants
actually start busting out, that real
[SPEAKER_01]: grainy, dusty shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to let that ... If you're going
to collect pollen, let that fall,
[SPEAKER_01]: let that get away, and then collect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 14 days into the pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about 10 to 14 days into when they
bust open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the really good pollen starts
coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little softer, a little smoother to
the touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's fully maturing into flower at
that point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His hormones are going in overdrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's spraying all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's letting them go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plant is producing trichomes and a
whole bunch of resin and has the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, you want to breed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to rub the stem and smell the stem
of my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smells like puke, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those plants, for some reason,
when it's got a hint of bar trash can and
[SPEAKER_01]: vomit, that's a good male to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that, when you smell that stem,
and if it's a male, you can go across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board and smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you have a bunch in a row from
your phenohunt that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them all next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell each one of them side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're cleaning your hands each
time to get a really good profile of what
[SPEAKER_00]: each one's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, the one that stinks the worst is
the best one to use.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, and then you narrow it down by
smell and then narrow it down by
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use all your senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't eliminate anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to take a leaf and snap one off
and taste the stem a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's sour and tarty and stuff a lot of
the times and you're using hardly no
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients at all, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's telling you, I got a lot of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot to add to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male is definitely going to contribute
to the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the mama definitely overwhelms the
flavor category, but the male is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to the amount of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just use any old male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use the best one you can at
any and all costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one of those things that we
look for, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you best a 10 pack of seeds,
you'll probably find maybe five males,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully, five females, five males.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to toss two of those right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is going to be funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is going to be a runt,
so those go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally know that I never use that
first plant to show me male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to take that first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's too dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like he's going to do too much to
my breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the plants are going to look like that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got three of them, I kind of would
lean toward the third one to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had five males that worked well,
probably that third or fourth one would be
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that I would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go right for that first one
that busted out because it's too obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing my breeding, I always
choose it based on what the mother is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm trying to say, if I'm out crossing
a blue dream or a sativa or something
[SPEAKER_00]: close to it that has a longer flowering
time and I want to come in with an indica
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually shorten its flowering time,
then that's when I would choose a male
[SPEAKER_00]: that's bust out first because I want to
take that flowering time and cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cut it down with that dominant
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If say you have a little indica dominant,
but you want to make it a true hybrid and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make it go a little bit longer
in the garden, say more if it's a seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight week and you want it to go more like
eight, nine, maybe 10-ish or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, then that's another reason
you'd go with a longer flowering male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same instance, just vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to have plants that flower
for a long time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know nine, 10, and 11 weeks sounds like
scary flowering times, but I flowered
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for 14 and 15 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is amazing once they get that
ripe and that far in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour diesel is a good example of that,
going that long 10, 11 weeks on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's well worth it in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a connoisseur product that
you can't gain anywhere else and the test
[SPEAKER_00]: results will show you the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The harvest weights come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an African land race that didn't
have a name and it grew colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut it down in week 14 and the colas
were bigger than my legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the biggest complication with
all growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young to old is patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the hardest thing we all have
to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to choke and then we're going to
keep this moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to beatbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, you should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not even edit it now since you're
beatbox and I might just leave that part
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do you want to add to that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything you want to add to
talking about selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: We pretty much covered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use all your senses and breed for a
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed for purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed for purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: All because of it's good and you want to
bang it together with something else that
[SPEAKER_00]: just looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't do it just because to do it or
don't do it because you got a cool name
[SPEAKER_00]: lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it for purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it for purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see too much of that in the industry
every day that you got to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain come up with the name lastly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do make something and it sucks.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you make a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got this male and then you've got
this prized female.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw pollen all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you pollinate, it's going to take you
about six more weeks until the seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe six or eight more weeks before we
can chop that plant down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let the plants dry until they're crispy
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just chop them down, let them get super
crispy and then I just rub them and the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds fall out and then I go and collect
all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I blast the material into oil
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to grow those seeds yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend you grow a hundred of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just at least germinate a hundred of them
right away and see what they do before you
[SPEAKER_01]: give any of them away to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germinate a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg out at least 50 and flower at least 25
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry them, cure them, smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it sucks, flush the seeds down the
toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them to your birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all human.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all make mistakes and you can only
control what you're doing so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only control so much of what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest is left in her hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes things just don't want to breed
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a strain that totally sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produced giant colas that tasted
amazing, but it would not get you high at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could smoke the entire crop and it was
no high at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main thing was breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one recently that came out was the
Dante's Inferno.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big hit for a lot of people
because a lot of people there are
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur smokers out there that like
growing things like grinspoon and other
[SPEAKER_00]: strains out there that are just absolutely
100% top grade connoisseur weed that yield
[SPEAKER_00]: like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies, it's not known for its
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known for its power and its flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That peppery sweet funk taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not growing that as a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times you're growing that for
personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing it for cash crop,
you have a lot of room and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bunch of Gavita somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warehouse style.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were we even talking about to get us
to that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I did have something I wanted to
add to the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding for terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our perfect ones is coming up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be one of our big front
runners is the S1 version of our blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cut has amazing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of everything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that is is because when you're
choosing males and females and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that breeding work, actually look at
their terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know and you can get it
tested, spend the 40, 50, 75 bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it takes, get it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have paperwork to back your stuff
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a legal state, you should be
able to get your stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more widely it's becoming nowadays,
you have literally half the country now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken over and you should be able to
get it tested by someone, somehow,
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out and then get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out a terpene profile and
then try to match it up with something
[SPEAKER_00]: that absolutely would complement those
terpenes but doesn't have them like our
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Blue Dream, which is a good clone
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good breeding parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeds true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known to breed stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred a couple good strains with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pop 100, 200 seeds and you might
get one or two hermies out of it just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it breeds that stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually takes the dominance of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you breed it with something like OGs
and diesels and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you add a whole different terpene profile
that really complements the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: muffiny hues and the blend and the
creaminess of the Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just stands out and it creates a whole
other animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, when you smuggle with them
first, tell them what it is lastly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't ever even would have guessed
it came from Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at it, never would have thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste it, never would have thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just peels them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got diesels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got OG tones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got blueberry tones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got creamy tones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's off the hook, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've smoked some of that with you
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you brought that last time and it
was definitely a tasty strain if that was
[SPEAKER_01]: what you brought for me to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed everything I breed to the
Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used it as a male, obviously,
because it's a clone only and it's a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything I've bred to it,
it is made huge colas, everything you put
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we did the OG cross on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it was to actually gain a
little bit of extra yield on it because
[SPEAKER_00]: OGs are lanky and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to put more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred Grateful Dog to the Blue Dream and
I call it the Blue Healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point was to put more vigor to the
Grateful Dog, just make it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger, a little chunkier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not a fan of the flavor of Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's girl weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like stripper weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a bland blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real muffiny and real creamy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like Jiffy Muffin smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the oven when you get the Jiffy
Muffins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the blueberry muffins in and it
kind of has that aroma of blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: muffiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry air freshener instead of
blueberry candies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like that blueberry marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell the markers in class.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gave me a weird flashback.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put that to the Grateful Dog and it
made it more pungent and more piney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it brought out a bottom layer of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred it to the King Kim Cross the Grape
Stomper OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call it the, well, it's the Blue
Stomper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one made it much stinkier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the King Kim Grape Stomper OG made
little tiny popcorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it makes spears since we put it to
the Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I tell people all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's been around for a long time,
held 15 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't count it out as a breeding
mother with hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't see Blue Dream on the label and
automatically turn it away because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably passing up a really, really good
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people that do not like
Blue Dream at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say your names on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, boys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of the nightmare lines people
fell in love with and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they call it a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nightmare dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, put two and two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: People didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you tell them, like, no, there's no
Blue Dream in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something important I should mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a breeding by eye
technique here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could make allele charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take a whole bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should take a whole bunch of notes
either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is kind of just a breeding with
love, grow from your heart, sort of do it
[SPEAKER_01]: by your eye, old school sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're breeding with a lot of experience
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you find a good male,
you're going to want to do a phenohunt of
[SPEAKER_01]: at least 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to find one with a
good structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to have the shape that you
want the babies to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find one that makes resin if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find one that makes a whole bunch of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't make enough pollen,
you're not going to make enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find one with real close node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find one that smells real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to select the very first one that
goes into flower and shows you that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely do not use any male plants that
show any sign of hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male plants can hermaphrodite also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see little male sacks popping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right out of the sides,
you'll see female pistols come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those aren't nut hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to cut fucking Bruce Jenner down
and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get Bruce Jenner out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ain't trying to have none of that shit
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will create lots of problems in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want to breed hermaphrodism
into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the exact opposite of what we're
aiming for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to that pollen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the pollen does start spitting,
you don't want that first grainy,
[SPEAKER_01]: sandy pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen, when you catch some of it and
put it in your hand and rub it in the palm
[SPEAKER_01]: of your hand, it'll feel smooth and silky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll feel real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you leave the grow room,
you're going to have to hose yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a mister, like a sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pump sprayer like you'd almost use to
pump pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get one of those and just spray yourself
down and wash your hands because tap water
[SPEAKER_00]: works really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, animals, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll deactivate any pollen that you've
got on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you are going from that pollen
room into a room that has female plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can always hose them down as you walk
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hit them with the sprayer and they
won't receive pollen for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just try to prevent that pollen from
getting onto your females if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have a male plant in the
house or in the room or in the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: with your females, it's going to try to
get pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've noticed, Bruce,
you can tell me if you've recognized this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got separate breeding rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an upstairs and a downstairs area
and an area over here and an area over
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I've got a male in one area and
females in a totally different area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed when I've got girls and a
flowering male in the same house,
[SPEAKER_01]: the girls get a little stickier and they
flower a little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think those girls know there's a
male around somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into some of my Forte lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know because of infrared lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants use infrared lighting to see around
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have natural spacing in the
woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why trees naturally space
themselves out, naturally weed out smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: ones below them and around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically go into the woods and new
pine tree forests and things like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have an equal spacing between trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infrared lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My horny girl plants know there's a stud
upstairs blowing his load.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pheromones, I believe,
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take in CO2 and they breathe out
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a constant intake between
oxygen and carbon dioxide battling back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're annual plants, so they've built
over thousands and millions of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have built defense mechanisms to try
to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they hermaphrodite on us when
we fuck with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody remembers the first Jurassic
Park, how the guy used to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: nature will always find a way and then all
of a sudden you have eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why, because nature will always
find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about something that is on
a total different level than what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mind boggling to think how,
in an evolution sense, how far ahead some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are than what we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to think we're the kings of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the center of the universe every day
of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, if you look at an ant,
if he was our size, you could lift your
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can lift like 500 times their natural
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd smile at you with one arm holding
your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really more about perception than
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just fucked with all the listeners'
heads and others visualizing an ant
[SPEAKER_01]: lifting up my house and running away with
it while we're in here recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, when you put it that way,
it's how you perceive things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wild universe out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole plant's mission is to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you got anything else you want to add
to this podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like we've covered selecting a
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that made a lot of sense to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want everybody to show up and show
Denver that we can do this better than
[SPEAKER_00]: they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people of Pueblo are going to
show them that we've held the state fair
[SPEAKER_00]: here for how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody we know actually made a good
point on social media that it's 11 days
[SPEAKER_00]: long, 25,000 people a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody can do it, Pueblo County can do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can host that many folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got enough hotels, eating places.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I actually plan to put together
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted it up to social media asking my
local friends for a little bit of help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put a podcast together and be
a little bit of a tour guide for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find places for you to stay,
places for you to eat, things for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, give you a little bit of information
about our town so that when you come here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're prepared and then we can all have a
good time and take a bunch of dabs and be
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and you'll have a good time with
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be such a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to have landed in this spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're holding the greatest party in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people talk a lot of trash,
but look what's about to happen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest cannabis event on the planet
is going to be here in our backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a blast,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's going to be a blast because I
have fun everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be there and I'm going to
be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse and Spencer are going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we need, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Spencer competing this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak for Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Garden of Weed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Maddie and the whole Garden
of Weed crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody's doing well over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just gave shout outs to dogs on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys follow my buddy Sour
Seeds on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can people find you, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find us on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find us on Instagram or Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own website, www.myohydank.co,
which we'll be changing over to
[SPEAKER_00]: sourseedcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get our hat pins and get custom
links right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right to our sites that sell our seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, thanks for the hat pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought me a nice little selection of
hat pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the Dab Scraper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy the heart, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just keeps everything fresh,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are your products available on thedankteam
.com at this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got to get you in touch with
our buddies over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Yankee needs to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys check out thedankteam
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know that we sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of iRegenetics stuff
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Black Cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_01]: available up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just damn good, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew some over at Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be on the shelves by the time this
podcast comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very likely be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually made some of the best
concentrates I've had in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd say top five that I've tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the flavors off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste the cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste the Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Black Cherry comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like some of my two favorite turps
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why shit happens, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's how breathing happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see two strains and a breeder that's
bred is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some artistry involved in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever let us think that we're taking
that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just pure science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's art to all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extractions, growing, breeding,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a good eye and a little bit of
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to listen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to lay down next to them and
listen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to feel the vibe from the
plants to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, brother, thank you for coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit a joint, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys fill your head with thoughts
while I fill my head with smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think I don't smoke a lot of flour,
but I've been smoking a lot of flour
[SPEAKER_01]: lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't passing Bogart over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get to that level, you just hold
on to a joint for a few minutes and smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my new cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll smoke it for a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, congrats on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 years clean, sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have you not had a cigarette now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mentioned that you had a problem one
night on the show and we didn't talk too
[SPEAKER_01]: much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said that you were planning on
coming, but you had a little issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke too much, collapse lung will
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm way glad you're repaired and
back in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting there.
