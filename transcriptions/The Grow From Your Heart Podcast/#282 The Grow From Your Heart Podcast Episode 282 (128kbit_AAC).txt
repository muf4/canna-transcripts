[SPEAKER_00]: It's Thursday, and that means it's time
for another Throwback Thursday episode of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the old episodes,
let me make a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I mention any advertising, any
giveaways, any promotions or any contests,

[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening,
and with no further ado, here's a block of
[SPEAKER_00]: old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 173 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me roster Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coop and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I planned this right,
[SPEAKER_00]: this will be coming out right at the start
of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be on this journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to
my friend, the dab and granny,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of my friends that joined us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little private party just a few
days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all met up somewhere and we hung out
and took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, who was there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people there,
so I'm going to miss a few people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to mention my new friend,
Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Jerry listens to the
podcast yet, but I made a new friend named
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry, and he's got a wonderful companion
animal with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dog is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also met your better half, but I cannot
think of her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure we were properly introduced,
but I'm glad that I finally got to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of cool stuff about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honor and a pleasure to meet Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the party, there was Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, of course, the dab and granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lovely Camille was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC Samuel was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobo Blasterco was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsey the Traveling Stoner was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a young man who I never caught
his name, but he gave me a dab that we
[SPEAKER_00]: will talk about in just a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even try to go through the list of
all the people that were at the little
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering that I participated in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to give the dab and granny a
huge shout out for inviting me to the
[SPEAKER_00]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a gram dab together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised everybody on Instagram that if
I got up to 10,000 Instagram followers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a one gram dab with the dab and
granny, and it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me a damn grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty much a damn grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me a gram dab of OG Kush
Distillate, and I took it like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nail cooled down a little bit too
quickly for me to get the whole dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all the Distillate hit the nail,
because I just squirted that sucker on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it hit the nail, it kind of cooled
down, but I took a dab like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big shout out to all the people
that went to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of these dabs I
took, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a gram dab of OG Kush Distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heated the nail real hot, and then the
Distillate comes in like a ... It is a
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe, you guys, but when I say the word
syringe, people get freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glass syringe, but it does not have
the tip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the pokey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't poke anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like a syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like something you would use to
feed a baby bird, is what I think it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be best described as.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little syringe, it's got Distillate
in it, raw Distillate, which was ... Let
[SPEAKER_00]: me turn on the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Distillate is probably 90% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of flavor to it,
but you put in these little glass
[SPEAKER_00]: syringes, and it's kind of hard to get
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit it with a torch for a couple of
seconds to heat it up and make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: viscous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I heat the nail, and the heat from
the dab nail and the heat that I applied
[SPEAKER_00]: with my dab torch worked together,
and I just pressed the tip of the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe onto the dab nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pressed the plunger of that syringe
down, and it took a second to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: going, but once it released, almost all of
that dab went onto the nail immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just ... Just one big gush of
liquid dabs onto the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all that smoke in my brain basically
in one big rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took two or three breaths to clear the
whole thing, but I got most of the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: in one big rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to my brain immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG Kush made me melt into the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt my butt grew roots, and I became
part of that couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to set the rig down, and I
immediately had to stand up and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, I have to walk around because
if I sit here, I'm going to take a nap at
[SPEAKER_00]: this private party where they are not
going to appreciate my giant six foot five
[SPEAKER_00]: self taking a nap and snoring like an
angry bear, because it was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a hibernation if I laid down at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wrecked high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked around for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's a video of this on the
Dab and Granny's Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure she did it on Facebook
Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it was Facebook Live, because
anything else, it disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably there on Facebook Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out the Dab and
Granny's Facebook Live, look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, look at the Dab and Granny's
Facebook Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on her Instagram, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on her Instagram, the Dab and
Granny's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I don't post dab videos to my
Instagram because the Instagram police
[SPEAKER_00]: have been shutting down Instagram accounts
in the cannabis community for random
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons, and I do not want to lose my
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see many smoking videos of me,
but you will see some wonderful cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post great pictures of male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post great pictures of my grow,
great stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial grows that I help in,
I post pictures there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The places I go consult, I'll take a nice
picture from there sometimes, but I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: post many pictures of myself consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this grand dab of distillate,
and I was high as giraffe pussy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was spinning around, I was floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people probably would have laid on
the couch and taken a four or five hour
[SPEAKER_00]: nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to stand up, walk around,
keep myself social, and keep moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was okay with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I stayed moving, stayed bouncy,
I was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several minutes after I took that dab,
another guy whose name I did not catch,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a beautiful dab rig, a super
colorful mini tube with a donut shape on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, fucking gorgeous rig, never caught the
dude's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never caught your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're listening, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you guys, the guy I'm talking
to gave me a dab of 99.9% THC isolate or
[SPEAKER_00]: isotol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it called also, but it was
basically just THC crystals in a crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: form, not like crystals like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people call THC crystals just the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it's got a lot of crystals,
but this was a crystalline form of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have extracted everything and just
have THC in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like salt or sugar chunks or
other drugs in a little container,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just sprinkle a little bit of it
into the dab nail, and it didn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it went in my lungs, I could feel
there was some smoke in my lungs or some
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor, I guess it would be, in my lungs,
but I really didn't get, it didn't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't feel like when you smoke
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't feel like when I take a dab,
there was no chest expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I take a dab, I feel my chest
expand a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the smoke wanting to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This THC dab was super smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at him like, I didn't notice a
damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he nodded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you blow that out, you're going
to get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when my body made, so guys,
I don't know if everybody else does this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I'm about to exhale, my lips make
a certain thing so that I can exhale at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right speed so that I don't go and
just blow all the air out at once and
[SPEAKER_00]: choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of, what's the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: You parse your lips a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You blow it like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're blowing up a balloon,
you make a certain face.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're blowing out a dab,
you make a certain shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I made those muscles to make my
lungs, my lips prepared to blow out the
[SPEAKER_00]: dab, I felt how high I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, and I was like, oh God,
there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could feel, I felt my face turn red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel my eyes droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that dude goes, yeah, you've noticed
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And granny goes, that's good shit,
isn't it, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't answer her properly as I
blew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arm hair was standing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moving around, my nipples were hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why sometimes when I take a
giant dab that works well, it makes my
[SPEAKER_00]: nips get all hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nips were diamond cutters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was intoxicated for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to kind of chill out for a second
and get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude had a gorgeous rig, but it had a
donut shape at the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a nice banger on it,
but I couldn't tell you much more about
[SPEAKER_00]: that rig other than my brain remembers
that it was colorful and gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't even remember the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how good that dab was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good at absorbing names and
putting names with faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's fucking face and name,
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I remember is the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's how tremendous that dab
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I consume at the little
party there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Caleb from Shoemit brought some
Shoemit bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never tried the red velvet bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brag all, or I boast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I love that banana pudding bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the red velvet bar is every bit
as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm a banana fan, I like the
banana more, but that red velvet,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's red velvet cake or red
velvet, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed around a couple candy bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a couple pieces of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time everything kicked in,
I was well-medicated for the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I've just been bragging about
all the cool shit I got to smoke and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wanted to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke OG Kush Distil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a gram dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke probably a 0.2 or a 0.3 of
99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course we took 10 or 20 normal
shatter dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny had some lemon shatter that was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Lindsay and Bobo had some tangy
shatter that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that showed up had some great
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give Granny a big,
huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny put the whole party together.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made sure everybody showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a place put together for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to the
place that let us have our little
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure we were supposed to be
smoking so many dabs and flowers in that
[SPEAKER_00]: place, but we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we also smoked a bunch of great
flower in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you guys, I normally don't smoke a
bunch of flower, but I took some great
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that I grew and I was sharing
those with my friends and people were
[SPEAKER_00]: really pleased with my most recent
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody that made it to
the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm giving shout outs, I want to
give a huge shout out to my friend Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tater came through huge, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tater Glass is a glass artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has made me a couple few custom glass
pencils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm holding mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what type of green this is,
but it has a red, yellow, and green wig
[SPEAKER_00]: wag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more wig than wag to it at the
tip or at the pencil or at the eraser end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the writing tip, it is red,
gold, and green, rasta colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great looking pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the eraser end where the eraser would
be, you guys, it has got a lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys would call it a milli.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it actually is a merini,
but it's a great looking lion on the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pencil from my friend Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got this blue pencil from
Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clear and it's got some glacier blue
on one end and with a cobalt on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: end with a cobalt blue glacier blue swirl
on the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great looking pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got this green one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this might be a Haderade or green
stardust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got some purple on both tips of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet pencils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure what half of these
colors that these glass artists use are
[SPEAKER_00]: called anymore because they are making
more colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no purple or blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like blue stardust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red is called Red Elvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color names are pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't call it the right name,
a glass artist will fucking correct you
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I want to give Tater an extra
huge shout out is because right around
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas, I got an idea that I should get
one more gift for somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided that I wanted to get them a
custom made Tater Glass pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept talking about wanting something
sparkly green and glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, let's get a sparkly green glass
Tater pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to get a green stardust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue glacier Tater Glass pencil with a
Grateful Dead bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are calling them Millies,
but I think they're Marinies, but it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: a Grateful Dead Marini or a Millie at the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to my buddy Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only Instagram friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be real friends, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get together and use these
pencils that we've got and take some fat
[SPEAKER_00]: globs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my friend Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it really quickly after I asked
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shipped it the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got to me within two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mad love, great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there is some real content to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a huge topic to talk about,
but you know how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get that far, I've got to do one
super duper important ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some shirts printed,
if you need hoodies printed, if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: some stickers made, if you need some hat
pins designed, my friends at Handmade
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparel can take care of all of your
custom printing needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to do is visit
HandmadeApparel.biz or send them in an
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Adam at HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you will be impressed,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They handle all of my printing because
they're the ones who I trust and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: super picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super meticulous about how things are
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like the way that these guys
do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've got these Grow From Your
Heart podcast hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logos are so fresh on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away when I opened them out of
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and Lindsay came by and picked up
theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super proud and super impressed
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few left.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were interested in a Grow From Your
Heart podcast hoodie, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to tell you how to get one of
these hoodies in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we need to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: My breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys love it when I give you breeding
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually gotten emails saying what
happened to the breeding updates because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do it on every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am currently... Today is probably day
60.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day that I am recording is 60 days
into flower on a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were hit with pollen
around... It was around day 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember off the top of my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 25 days into flower,
those plants received pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now 60 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, every couple of days,
I will go take one seed from a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a random plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a method to my madness,
but I'll pick a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will pull a seed from near the
middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling one seed off... I can see the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're swelling up in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pull one off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of days ago, I pulled one seed
out of flow and the seed was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside was the right color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside was the right texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I squeezed it and I could feel that it was
a little bit soft, so it wasn't fully
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took my fingernail to crack the shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used my thumbnail and got through the
shell and I could tell the inside was very
[SPEAKER_00]: white and the seed was not quite done,
but we are very few days away from those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds being ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding project is almost
completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stopped feeding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just getting clean water now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just get clean water for the next
few days until I do cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of material there,
but the leftover material will get turned
[SPEAKER_00]: into shatter so that we could smoke some
dabs out of the stuff that is left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon, there will be new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm guessing within the next five to 10
days, those plants will get cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hang upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut off all the large leaves very
soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hang them upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let them get really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will just lay them in kind of
long Tupperware dishes is what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut them into little sections and lay
them in Tupperware dishes and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: them get real dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the buds start crumbling up and
the seeds start falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I have some spare time,
I just sit there with some rubber gloves,
[SPEAKER_00]: like these black nitrile gloves,
sit there with those on and just crunch up
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear the seeds fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just tip the container to one
side and all the seeds roll to one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bud material stays at the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the seeds out, put them in a labeled
jar, keep them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what will happen is I'll leave
them open for, since they sat out for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, they'll probably be plenty dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any moisture in those seeds,
I'll leave them open, but I'll seal them
[SPEAKER_00]: up and let them sit for a few days and
think about who I want to give them to so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can have some of my friends grow
out some of my new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also grow a whole shit ton of it by
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming up pretty soon in the room,
the female plants were Cookies and Cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Flow Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few Arise plants in there
so that we can make some Arise F2s because
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds are a lot of fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Arise F2 has been showing some
great, great phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing a few of those seeds out
in little tiny pots and they look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an update on the
breeding project, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nearly done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are getting hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five to 10 days and I will be cutting them
down and then they'll dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another five to 10 days from there,
I'll start pulling the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another five to 10 days from
there, I'll start giving seeds out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully five to 10 days from there,
people have shit germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully 120 days from there,
we've got pictures and flowers to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that kind of stuff so that we can
see what the crop did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my breeding update.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to do, you guys,
once a month, I like to go and read these
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes comments because if I let them go
for more than a month, I seem to forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the month of December, I received two
iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you want to go to iTunes,
all you have to do is go to the iTunes
[SPEAKER_00]: store, go to the podcast tab, search for
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you just go to iTunes that says
library, unplayed and store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the store, search in Grow From Your
Heart, find the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll down, it's a little icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my face on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you know what it looks like by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the ratings and review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the option right here to
give me some stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give me as many stars as you feel
I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, ladies and gentlemen, 41 people
have given me a five-star review and 35
[SPEAKER_00]: people have left a written review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read the two most recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a person who called
themselves JJ OliveOil08.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left it on December 5th and they
said, Jeff is a very positive guy with so
[SPEAKER_00]: many informative things to say about
growing and the rest of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hearing that I'm a positive guy and
my goal is to be informative with shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: say about growing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excellent, great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I got five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment comes from a person that
calls himself SamS37.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, thanks Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that weird they said
accent came from, but that was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, I've learned a ton from Jeff
and the awesome guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing your knowledge with the
community and helping make the world a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're learning from me and my
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal is to teach some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm able to share this knowledge
with my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes a community is sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing everybody together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making cannabis better, which makes
people less grumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them less sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people have cannabis,
the better the world is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will keep fighting the good fight as
long as I'm able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the review, SamS37.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I truly appreciate all of the
iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, 35 positive reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody had some bad shit to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten 41 five-star ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you want to leave me a
rating in a review, I would completely
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something to say and you
don't want to say it here on iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're not an iTunes user or
listener, you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want to give one shout out,
which is going to lead into the main topic
[SPEAKER_00]: of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do it, I feel like I've been
talking for a long time, and I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: talking very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for one
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take two dabs, and then I'm
going to take a drink of some tasty
[SPEAKER_00]: gingerade kombucha, and I'll be right
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't even notice I took a
break, because there's just going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little brrra brrra brrra sound,
and I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I'd be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heavily medicated now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some dabs of Cascade in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just drank some frosty cold GTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that gingerade kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do throw it away when I get to
that bottom booger, because I just can't
[SPEAKER_00]: handle that chunky shit at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have to talk shit, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't handle that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this GTs is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there is a point to this podcast,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a shout out that will
lead me into this point of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adjusting my headphones, getting my
shit back together after that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head is spinning a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, I say the word spliff kind of
oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do word well with the SPL sound
for some.
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to end it with two Fs,
fucks me up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: SPLIF.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a podcast that I've been listening
to called The SPLIF Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She spells it podcast, P-O-T-C-A-S-T.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SPLIF Podcast is a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to it for 50
something, probably 60 episodes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am completely caught up and it is a
great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it because I'm high and
I'm recommending it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously, if you like my podcast,
you will enjoy The SPLIF Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hosted by, I'm going to call her my new
friend, Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to her for 60
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're buddies now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just a dab away from being BFFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these days, she's going to come
to Colorado because I hate traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't travel well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some dabs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, Bo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out with Miss Jenny Beth and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a room, got a spot for you at the dab
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll record a podcast together and we can
both release it at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can just do a dual episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your audience can be introduced to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll introduce you to my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they haven't already heard you and
we'll get it going like that, but come
[SPEAKER_00]: take a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, Bo does a lot of talk about
very specific cannabinoid dosing and
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strains and very specific stuff
for medicine for patients, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely respect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sometimes I do not completely
agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's okay to disagree with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at you, Bo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying sometimes I don't
completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are too focused on
lab tests and they're not following their
[SPEAKER_00]: own body, their own intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's the dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Toucan Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to say, follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to cannabis and
selecting cannabis that will work for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe that follow your nose
because it always knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab tests are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't believe 50% of the lab
tests that I see because I just saw a 34%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC test for a strain that I think is
bullshit, but that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow your nose over the lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like strains that get your
attention are probably good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your body craves salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably needing salt or you're
thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll be at the grocery store
and you can look at the fruit and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see seven different kinds of delicious
fruit, but one of them calls your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's a vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something calls your name and it just
jumps out and you're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to eat some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like your body is programmed to let
you know what you want and what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes you think when you're
thirsty, your body goes, I'm thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you recognize that because you're
lacking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you need some vitamin C and
you're walking through the grocery store,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see oranges and your eyes
are going to go, that's the thing right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also why I think poop stinks
because you're not supposed to eat poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you believe in nature,
jaw, God, whoever created us made it
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our poop stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we desire the stuff that our body
needs because we're supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cannabis smells good because
we're supposed to be consuming it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to support my statement, I think
physically people who are related don't
[SPEAKER_00]: find each other's pheromones attractive
because we're not supposed to be mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too close in bloodline together,
if you're family, you probably won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on by somebody's scent,
which sounds weird, but we are attracted
[SPEAKER_00]: to pheromones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you'll smell somebody of the
opposite sex and you will want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too close to you, you're
genetically programmed to not find their
[SPEAKER_00]: smell attractive so that you don't hit on
your cousin is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our bodies know, our bodies
give us signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm really getting at is I think
that the medicine the cannabis that calls
[SPEAKER_00]: at you is probably got something in it
that you need to be consuming or that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of what makes me think this,
we were, I've been helping out in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow, you guys, I bounce around
from grow to grow, but I've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: another grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend James is constantly walking
to two very specific plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: James is from the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a strain called Recon in one of
the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since James is from the South,
he calls it Recon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just let James call it Recon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, he's James, what are we
going to do for the old Southern boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: But Recon always gets his attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves the way Recon smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will always, there are four rooms in
this facility and they're all in different
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put James in there and you go
walk to a plant, you'll always watch him
[SPEAKER_00]: walk over to the Recon and just give it a
smell and stand by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another strain in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Banana Split.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows these big purple buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gorgeous, but it's got a smell that
James can't stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put him in the room to defoliate or
do work, he always ends up working on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Recon or a Banana Split plant because they
call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's something in there that
James needs, like either recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it is, but it's
calling him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's something in that
plant that James needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If James is going to consume cannabis,
it should be one of those strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: calls his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to be, he might not
be sick, but that's going to be the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the most healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most therapeutic for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly recommend that he try some
of that stuff when it's ready and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some more things that I can
support my statement that our nose
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates which cannabis is best for us
with my own experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about me,
if you pay attention to my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, a lot of my breeding leans
toward the lemony flavored Sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like high THC content and I like a
really lemony flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy a citrusy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've noticed when I smoke stuff
with an orange flavor, Tangerine Haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy, the Orange Creamsicle, Orange
Dreamsicle, Agent Orange, anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: that orange turp to it, it's a very mellow
yet uplifting sort of good mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: good vibe sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oranges is always like an anxiety
free, mellow, chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it kind of a breakfast high.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing, I like to handle my
business in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my emails, I do my phone calls,
any stuff that's going to require a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: like clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get it done before I end up
taking my lunchtime dabs because at
[SPEAKER_00]: lunchtime we get down for some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to get, if I'm going to smoke in
the morning, I like to have something a
[SPEAKER_00]: little lighter if that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jilly Bean is a great breakfast dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke something like Jack
Herrer or Jack the Ripper first thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to just kind of fuck up my
whole flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be off kilter all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be a little anxious because when you
get that high in the morning, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I fuck stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave something at home or I'll leave
something on and leave and go all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you'll do that thing where you put the
gas pump in the car and drive away with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pump in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that, but that's the kind
of shit I feel like I could do if I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: too strong of a sativa in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get my head on straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start off with that,
that orangey turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just talked myself back to where
I was, so that fucking lost track of where
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, but I found it you guys,
so you can't make fun of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those orangey turps are always like
mellow and uplifting and a smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always make me kind of smile,
put me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always what I've noticed from
orangey turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon turps, it makes my head spin and it
makes me motivated and it makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do these podcasts, I like to
smoke heavy sativa dominant lemon flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get right to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm smoking Cascade, which is bred
by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lemon skunk female that was
pollinated by a daybreaker male and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: using phenotype, which was known as B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the really lemony, it smells like
dish soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly you guys, this is why I named it
Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cascade, the feeling of something coming
over you, like the waterfall of this
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that happens when you dab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Cascade and then it also smells
like lemon dish soap, which is Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called it Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it makes me talkative and
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my version of alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan takes 17 alpha brain before a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke six dabs of Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really feel like these lemon turps
keep me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do battle some... My brain is mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I hit my head a long time ago
and my mood swings a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get pissy sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a few Cascade dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what I was mad about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like the high sativa,
the lemon turps work well for my body
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I'm going to say that
supports my statement, this may sound
[SPEAKER_00]: racist, but it's not racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a geographical thing that I feel
like I have discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I live, we have a high population of
Mexican and Hispanic heritage people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people here have people,
bloodlines straight to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most popular strains to ever
come around where I live... You guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very heavily Mexican populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, we got some sour diesel
here and it has not gone away since then
[SPEAKER_00]: because the Mexican people here love sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smell that sour diesel smell down
the block, if you burn some sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Mexican heritage person will ask you for
some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, in 2017, I don't know if it's
racist to call somebody a Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people that have their families
from Mexico and they got Mexican blood in
[SPEAKER_00]: them, that is a Mexican person to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the other word.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a better word I should be
using, tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I need to make a correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said pheromones of somebody from
the opposite sex could get your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pheromones from anybody could get your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if that was offensive as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to be more sensitive to
that sort of thing without overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the same sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to be racist with the
Mexican word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that the Mexican people
around here love to smoke sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory, I could be wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Rasta Jeff's theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been doing this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mexican people here love sour diesel
almost more than any other strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Mexican sour diesel is a chem
dog crossed to a Mexican sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there is a heavy Mexican sativa genetic
in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that Mexican sativa is what
causes that skunky smell, that real skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: funk, pungent odor that almost tends to
lean to the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a Mexican sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that since that Mexican sativa
plant and the Mexican people come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same spot on the planet, they are getting
a stronger benefit and a stronger desire
[SPEAKER_00]: for that plant because it's geographically
from where they're from in their body,
[SPEAKER_00]: their history.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about where they are,
something in that sour diesel plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to benefit their life because of
their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something in their body
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something in their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's pre-programmed in
their memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to back it up with
science or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just my opinion and my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole point here is that I feel like
your body, your nose, your mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: your senses are probably the best judge of
what cannabis is best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do respect the lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate the idea of a lab
test, but please do not let that lab test
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin your idea of a certain strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a strain gets your attention,
okay, if you have two strains sitting next
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other and you have a lab test for
both of them and you can smell both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, if one has great lab tests and one
smells better, get the one that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's properly trimmed and cured and
grown properly, if they're both top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, get the one that smells better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost guarantee you, you're going
to have more pleasure from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I want to add to this 30
minute rant about selecting your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains via your nose instead of your lab
test, don't discredit a strain because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've tried it once from one grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear people say, oh, I hate whatever
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the quality of a flower you
purchase can vary widely on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain for very many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get this all through my
brain and to you clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any notes on this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow some flowers and Jesse grows
some flowers, and my girl Jenny grows some
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, they're all three going to come
out different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow with botanic care nutrients
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse grows with organic nutrients in a
light depth greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say she grows in a tent
with synthetic newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our stuff is going to come out
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have a clone of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab testing will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavors will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid profile will be a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out differently because
of the different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be different phenotypical
expressions, which also leads me to
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody selected a shitty phenotype
of that strain for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they got a 10 pack of seeds and they
chose the one that grows short and stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have preferred the one that
grows tall and skinny, but that's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't get a good representation of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't discredit something just because you
didn't like it the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Jenny grew it, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Jesse grew it, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grew it, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like Jenny's style better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like Jesse's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like mine better, and you just got
to find ... Give a strain a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gives you a headache or a panic
attack or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see why you'd avoid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not go for it a second try,
but if you just didn't like it for some
[SPEAKER_00]: weird reason, give it another shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be discrediting yourself on
something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, so focus more on the
effects of the cannabis, how much it draws
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab tests are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really like a lab test for is now
they are showing pesticides and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my concentrates, I can see how many
residual solvents are in my dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see how much pesticide is in my
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being able to see that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like seeing it when things test
really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk in the future about
actual lab test numbers because people see
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and THCA and they're not sure which
ones to brag about on the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that a little
bit in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more note that I added to this that I
want to make sure I cover before I move on
[SPEAKER_00]: from the lab test versus your senses is
that the labs are all calibrated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those machines have the same base
and the same ... I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: same standard is, what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran the same THC through that machine
to set a standard for all of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're all calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies are not calibrated the exact
same, so there will be differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body chemistry is going to play a huge
role in what cannabis works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab tests are great, but your body
chemistry, your nose, your eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: your mouth, hopefully your ears aren't
involved too much in selecting your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis unless you heard of a killer
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you feel, all of that stuff should be
a huge decision maker for your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust in the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all those tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what kind of pesticides are in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe here's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find some strains that you like and
you can find lab testing on all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that is slightly consistent, find what is
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the common thread through those
tests, and then maybe you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for more strains like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I believe that we're going
to have tailor-made cannabis dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to go get a tailor-made,
the perfect amount of Terps, the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cannabinoids, the right amount
of each cannabinoid, however you want it,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever ratios you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to get a pill probably made
for yourself that you can swallow and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is your perfect cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start looking now at those lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the little chart that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find all those common threads,
and you'll be ahead of the game when that
[SPEAKER_00]: time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few seconds ago, I was talking
about strains that give me panic attacks
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning and strains that I like to
smoke at certain times of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was outlining this episode,
I decided to make a short list of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them low panic strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got jelly bean written down as a
low panic strain, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangerine haze is a low panic strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy is a low panic strain, in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things, in my opinion,
that do not cause panic and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sativa kind of strains that put
a smile on my face and put a little pep in
[SPEAKER_00]: my step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got to do dishes, if you have to
vacuum the house, these are the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: strains for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep you moving and they don't seem
to mess up my focus and ruin my plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I smoke something too sativa
heavy first thing in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, a big fat joint of lemon
Jeffrey first thing in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not get the right things done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get some shit done, but it will not
be what was on the to-do list at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something will get cleaned that did not
need to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff with the orange turps I think are
great for the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things to avoid if you get panicky,
strains I would stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper, way too sativa dominant
for your head first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space Queen, way too much for your head
first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel, way too much for most people
first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get panicky, stay away from the
sour diesel, the Vortex, the Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper, the Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay away from that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the giggles, something that is
often given a lot of people that giggles
[SPEAKER_00]: is the LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a really indica dominant
LA confidential, smoke on that and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some CBN shatter a few days ago
with a couple of friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find products that are high in
CBN, you will get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that dab and by the time I was done
blowing the dab out, I wanted to eat the
[SPEAKER_00]: rig and the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to eat everything inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBN is good if you're trying to get
hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to think of things that'll
help you guys out for specific strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for very specific CBD
strains, I can recommend Tora Bora,
[SPEAKER_00]: ACDC and Pennywise.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are looking for CBD
dominant strains right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I like to talk about is the
Night Nurse and I also like King's Cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: King's Cure is available in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Nurse is sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to find King's Cure in a
few places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab those if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some great CBD phenotypes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention, if people are
thinking about starting to use medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, first of all, start very
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to smoke, I suggest
starting off with flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off with a pipe with some flowers in
it or a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take one or two medium size puffs or draws
or inhalations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull it in until you feel like your
lungs are swelling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get enough smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to feel it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever died from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really scared that you're going
to have a shitty high and you're worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, make yourself a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have some food ready is what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanut butter and jelly sandwich is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might not be able to eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have something ready that you can just
snack on and be in a cool environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes wrong, eat your food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm headed with this is if you're
new to medical marijuana and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about trying medical marijuana,
this is something I think you should think
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a very smart plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has been here for a long time,
and I'm sure that it was given to us for a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal purpose, which lets me think
that if you have some pain, or an ailment
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're trying to medicate through
cannabis, cannabis will target that
[SPEAKER_00]: ailment before it will cause intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you've got a broken part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say my knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: My left knee swells up by the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't do something about it,
my left knee hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I work hard, if I'm squatting up and
down carrying shit, my left knee will
[SPEAKER_00]: start to throb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll hurt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a few dabs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: First two dabs, I don't get high from it,
but I can feel my knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first dab, the constant pain,
the like the, oh, that goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: One dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can relax, but I'm still at the
point where if I put pressure on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to lift up something and walk up some
stairs, it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dab number two removes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm at level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pain-free at sit still, and I'm
pain-free at work mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pain-free now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next dab kind of makes me feel high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm getting to recreational dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My third dab, now I'm just high,
or my fourth dabs are now can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourth dab, now I'm just high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get fucked up having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that cannabis and
cannabinoids know how to go target that
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and deal with that pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are legitimately, and I feel the
same thing works with opiates or other
[SPEAKER_00]: pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break your knee and you go to the
doctor and they give you Vicodin,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably going to give you
something better than Vicodin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know about pharmaceuticals
because I don't fuck with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break your knee and you go to the
doctor, they're going to give you pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have something broken, you're not
going to get high as fuck off those pills
[SPEAKER_00]: if you take the recommended dosage,
it's going to go to your knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not broken and you take those
pills, you're probably going to get high
[SPEAKER_00]: and feel like shit from them because you
don't have any pain to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis knows that is what
I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're afraid of cannabis,
that is my encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is very smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is very gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis wants to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have consumed a lot of things in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things were not my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things made me feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things made me see the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has always been my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was sick, if I was well, if I was
bummed out, if I was happy, cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about trying
cannabis or if you've got somebody in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life that you want to encourage to use
cannabis, give them a pep talk that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis knows where to go hit the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got pain and you've got a
problem, you're not going to get too
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up right away because cannabis
wants to solve that problem first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
somebody asked for longer episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to go a full hour by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm just rambling out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed this 45 minutes solo
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to try to
shift gears and we're going to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: product review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quite often ask if people would like to
have a product reviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they need to do is send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com and I
can teach you how to get your product in
[SPEAKER_00]: my hands and I will review it here on the
show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My latest product I have got for review
today is a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was sent to me by Chop Shop Grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Chop Shop Grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice black shine to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the Chop Shop Grinders logo on
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very similar to most grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a top piece that you lift open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your flour product in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the lid back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give it a good spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got a part you unscrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm unscrewing it as I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice mesh screen in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where your ground flour ends up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says to grind it coarse to leave it one
direction for a fine grind to flip it
[SPEAKER_00]: upside down and grind it that way for a
finer grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course it's got this little
screen here to where on the bottom you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually catch the keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a keef catching kind of guy,
you can put that in your bowls or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put that on your joints or you can do
whatever you want with your keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of uses for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of puts me on a side rant you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a pollen catch is what this
portion of the grinder is, but keef is not
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that call keef pollen, you are
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen comes from male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no pollen in your female plants
unless something went horribly wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are not catching pollen that is
keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are mainly trichomes that you were
gathering in the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can gather those up and put them on a
bowl or you can put them in a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're going to wrap a little bit of
wax around the joint, you can also put
[SPEAKER_00]: that keef on the outside of the wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically trichomes that have
fallen off of your buds, but it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please quit calling that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get back to this grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I do like about this grinder is
it is super light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another grinder that I carry in
my backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has replaced the backpack
grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got these really, one thing I
complain about grinders is they get stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get some material in there,
they start getting a little sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has little, I want to call them
just finger indentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just little grippies for your
fingers to where it's not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I will always be able to spin
this grinder because of the little finger
[SPEAKER_00]: grippies on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sharp stone grinder, it got stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to get it undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a chop shop grinder to use
and it will not get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can rely on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put a couple of flowers in
here and we're going to smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do that, I've already got one
tiny complaint about this grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only complaint I have is that it's
too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is probably three inches in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got two nuggets sitting here that
I plan on rolling into one joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to grind both of my buds
separately because they will not fit in
[SPEAKER_00]: this grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be everybody's problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody may not have giant buds or too
much weed for their grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a guy like myself, I'm going to
have to run this grinder twice just to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these buds ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of semi breaking up this first
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a stem in the middle I'm taking
out, but now I've got this grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top portion is pretty full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting the little lid on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it a grind into the mic
so you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it took.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weed is pretty much ground up,
ready to roll into a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it a couple more twists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take the top off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just going to put the other nug in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to give it a little pre break.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm grinding up is called Burning
Spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Girl Scout Cookies, the forum cut
of Girl Scout Cookies pollinated by a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's forum cookies to grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a feminized seed that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not put these seeds out to the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a few of them to Spence from the
Garden of Weeden for his birthday one
[SPEAKER_00]: year, and he is the only one that got
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he gifted a couple of
those to another grower friend because I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Spence and that one dude are the only
people that really got seeds of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells very Girl Scout Cookies-y,
but once you start grinding it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it releases a chem dog fuel, funk,
dirty feet sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like if you hid your bag
of Girl Scout Cookies weed in a dirty sock
[SPEAKER_00]: in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got it nice and ground up here in
this Chop Shop grinder, which I like the
[SPEAKER_00]: grind, the consistency and texture that it
ground is perfect for a nice joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too too fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too coarse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did it the normal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says for a coarser grind to flip it
upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's see, I stuck two papers
together because I like to roll fat
[SPEAKER_00]: joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I made myself a little tip here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dump the dope into here and give it
a twist and a lick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to smoke a joint
together while we do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to lick it and twist
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't hear me rambling while I lick
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, got to tuck that corner.
[SPEAKER_09]: The key to rolling a good joint is just
getting that first corner tuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give it a lick right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I do, you guys might think I'm
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lick the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't lick the gummed part because I
feel like you just drag that gummed part
[SPEAKER_00]: around and you waste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My joints tend to stick a lot better if I
lick the outside and moisten that gum and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't lick it off with my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I light this joint, I should
conclude my grinder review, Chop Shop
[SPEAKER_00]: grinder review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit small, but the small
size is okay because of how light it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much better backpack grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ground my weed perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the little pollen catch that is
actually a keef catch on the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came with a little scooper so that when
I do have a nice collection, I can scoop
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say I approve of this
grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a grinder,
this one would make you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Chop Shop grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out on the
interweb.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a joint rolled up, so I'm going
to light this joint and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a joint together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys are rolling something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys twisted up a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet and let me know what
you're smoking with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send the tweet to at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, my brain went blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even lit this joint yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me a tweet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear it because I'm going
to light this joint and then we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to the main topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main topic is going to be,
it's kind of a double topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's male selection and starting a
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got multiple emails about male selection
and breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to choose two of those emails
and read them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will also talk about pollen
storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about another product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's light this joint and then we'll
read an email.
[SPEAKER_09]: That tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke a whole bunch of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do light a big joint as some
weed that I grew, it was dried and cured
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly and trimmed by me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a real treat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and it burns nicely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did a good job, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish somebody was here to pass this
joint too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're going to smoke this joint and
read an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered your podcast a couple of
months ago and I've become an avid fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You present a perfect balance of friendly
personality and real information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, in fact, I'd say most cannabis
podcasters do too much of one or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like many of your fans, my only problem is
wanting more episodes and for them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a longer episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've noticed that the last
episode was a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Mike is here, the episodes get
really long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to make them a little bit
longer for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: This joint is just hitting like a champ,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep puffing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole area is cloudy already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the email goes on to say,
I particularly enjoy hearing all about
[SPEAKER_00]: your breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you might be able to
talk on the show about how you would go
[SPEAKER_00]: about starting a small breeding project
from the ground up because it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really like to explore in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know about your strategy for
choosing strains or for choosing traits
[SPEAKER_00]: and strains you want to cross and how you
keep a male you like such as Solomon going
[SPEAKER_00]: for multiple breeds and how long the
process from ideal idea to stable seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I run the mom department at a large
dispensary in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I have limited space to work
with, I have started using bonsai
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques such as root pruning to keep
the mom small.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this technique, they live fairly
happy in a two gallon pot indefinitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: staying around a foot or two tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, my oldest is about a year old and
her clones still root and produce healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you have any knowledge
or experience with this method that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would want to share with someone who is
trying it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, teach me that method,
please, because my mother plants grow so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly that I have to put them into
larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sounds like something that would
benefit me because I try to keep a large
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of mother plants and I don't have a
lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please send me your tech on this,
share that with me, and I will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it more on the show for other listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the email goes on to say, lastly,
I was hoping you could give this dad
[SPEAKER_00]: amateur a few tips on not coughing so hard
after dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the great podcasts that
keep me smiling and learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, Jessica.
[SPEAKER_00]: She actually says, PS, you can use my
first name on the podcast if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also included her Instagram handle,
and I am now following you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over a couple of those things
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, thanks for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started the email by complimenting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to learn more about your mother
plant tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you said you were hoping that I
could give you a few tips on not coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to reveal some Jedi secrets
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, if you're coughing a lot,
your nail may be too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that nail cool, go for some low temp
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to teach you some Rasta Jeff
tricks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take gigantic dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of my lung health and
how large my dabs can be, how my ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to take large dabs directly correlates
with my level of hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't drink enough water and I get
dry, my lungs get sore and I cannot take
[SPEAKER_00]: the dabs that I desire to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to stay hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to drink plenty of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more water I drink, the bigger dabs I
can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have to exercise my lungs and
allow my lungs time to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lungs, they need rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a giant muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They expand and contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that they're really a muscle,
but they work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get bigger, they get smaller,
they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You breathe in, you breathe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting a lot of work on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need some time to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get up, I need to breathe for a
little bit before I take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get the lungs going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get the heart rate moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get the blood moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it's time to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do like a pre-dab breathe
exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let the lungs wake up,
let my body get breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll take my first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my first dab makes me want to choke,
I can control my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this to a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this to a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us, if you get like a leg twitch
or a leg cramp, or a leg itch,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if your foot itches or something,
you don't just fall on the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: start twitching and you don't go out of
control and you don't just give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your children do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen kids do it and it's hilarious,
but we don't do that as adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would we let our lungs be out of
control?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got control of your, unless you're
sick or something, I'm not trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: fun of anybody, but a normal human being,
a normal adult person, myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not accept my leg just walking out
from underneath me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my leg starts to get a cramp or
something, I use my mind and I control my
[SPEAKER_00]: legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, stand still, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do the same thing with my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if I'm about to choke,
my lungs are mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have to let my lungs do this
rapid expansion and make me choke and turn
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm about to cough, I breathe in as
hard as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel that tickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, and your body goes, and your chest
does this instant move.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I feel that coming, I breathe in as
hard as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've just changed my lungs mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wanted to cough, but it's like,
oh, I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't cough because he's got me
inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as I get that breath,
as far in me as I can, I push out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I parse my lips and I push my,
my smoke goes out at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I push out as hard as I can, but through
parsed lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about this in the past episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my lips kind of together to keep
that air coming out slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's pressure on my lung,
but I'm not blowing out all that smoke at
[SPEAKER_00]: one ridiculous time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's keeping my lung busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't, I'm so busy focusing on that
breath that my lungs will not twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Jedi mind tricking myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am yoga breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Lamaze breathing, and I'm just
tricking my body into not being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: cough by keeping it busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy by the name of Wim Hoff,
who teaches a lot of breathing techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of body healing technique just
through breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of yoga is based on breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of meditation is based on breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lamaze is all breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if these things can get you
through huge situations in life,
[SPEAKER_00]: women use Lamaze to get through
childbirth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I delivered a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_00]: My child was born at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I delivered that kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the kind of breathing that mama had
to do to not lose her shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only thing she had.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could scream at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could have faith in whatever she has
faith in, and she could breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breathing is the one thing I could
physically see get her through the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: and the challenge of having a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breathing is magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can control your breath.
That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to get as many miles on my
lungs as I can without blowing them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of what I learned,
the breathing technique came from a man by
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of Sergio Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Sergio Herrera and Sergio Jr.
When I was a youngster, I took a karate
[SPEAKER_00]: class instructed by Master Sergio Herrera,
and he taught us a lot about breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm remembering how far back I've
been using breathing techniques to calm my
[SPEAKER_00]: body and my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we would run out of breath,
he would work us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The karate instructor would work you until
you were exhausted, and they would make
[SPEAKER_00]: you control your breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would make you breathe in as deeply as
you could through your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your lungs are filled with air,
your chest is fully expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel like you're full, he would tell
you, breathe in a little more,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have to force in a little
breath through your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just trying to suck in this
last bit of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once he thinks you're full and
he's satisfied, he'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: now blow all the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would make us blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would say, there's more in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be squeezing weird muscles to
force your lungs to push out that last bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your body would make weird noises
because you're trying to push air out
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would immediately make you
breathe right in again as hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now go deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was how I would slow my heart
rate and my breathing and get control,
[SPEAKER_00]: get my composure again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in a spar or a karate
tournament or a match and my heart rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: my mind were getting away or my breathing
was getting away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our way to re-center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes two or three of those,
five of those, and you were on top of your
[SPEAKER_00]: game all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trick to not coughing is control
your lungs, be a Jedi about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your lungs busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lungs can't freak out and start
coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're controlling them and your mind
and your lungs are stuck together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just focused on that breathing that
in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things you got to do,
breathe in, breathe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to answer more of your
breathing question, but I've got another
[SPEAKER_00]: email that I want to read and I will
answer both of the questions kind of at
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm finding the other email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise this email has a lot of stuff
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll take me a second to get through
it, but it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, just in case you're
wondering, I'm a little more than halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: through this joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been puffing it when you don't hear
me talking and I'm getting well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ross and Jeff, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your podcast for a
while now, and I have a few questions on
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out here in Colorado just doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a new Tree of Life high CBD strain
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 100% germination and 50% male to
female ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty solid, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering when selecting a male to
use for pollination as the father,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that in just a
second, but I want to get through your
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also say, do you do any testing on the
leaves to find CBD or THC content?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also mentions that he's obviously
looking for the lowest THC possible as to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them under the 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want your plants to qualify as
hemp in Colorado, they have to test at
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 0.3% THC or they are considered
cannabis and you can't sell that flower as
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp flower and it has to be grown in a
completely different environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was completely different licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it tests too high, if you grow your
hemp at a hemp farm and it tests too high
[SPEAKER_00]: in THC, it must be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's trying to breed and he's trying to
keep it low THC, high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, is there any
truth in having males growing next to
[SPEAKER_00]: females could make the females hermy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that recently somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's asking if having males grow next
to the females will make the females herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that will not make the females herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have males near your female plants,
I feel like the females know the males are
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they get stickier and the
trichomes get a little thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I think the female plants
can smell the males or they can feel a
[SPEAKER_00]: pheromone or a hormone in the air and they
get a little hornier and they show more
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of wanting pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, having a male plant near your
female plants will not make the females
[SPEAKER_00]: herm, but what will happen is the males
will pollinate the females and it will not
[SPEAKER_00]: take much pollen and it will not take a
lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the females will not herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will seed because they were properly
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you say, when breeding, when is the
best time to hit the ladies with pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that here and more
of my breeding rant when I combine the two
[SPEAKER_00]: emails with one answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I just realized that I skipped
right over your part about asking about
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do any testing on the leaves to
find CBD or THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that is a very useful option that
is available from our friends at Steep
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do that, I highly
encourage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you an idea, but it will
not give you the exact potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it'll give you an idea of what the
ratios will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have the leaves tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I would recommend Steep Hill
Labs for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also do early testing to tell you
if your plants from seed are males or
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, will they need six to seven
weeks to fully mature?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that in a little
more detail in just a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also go on to say, I have a lot of
testing to be done on my 10 female phenos,
[SPEAKER_00]: five cherry wine F3 and five cobblers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing to begin at day 43 of flower to
day 56 per pheno to find that highest CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: content and lowest THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck with your pheno hunting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pheno hunting is always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing a nice pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find the phenotype that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find that perfect CBD for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to make great medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this project goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go on to say, thank you for your time
and keep the podcast going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only came across yours recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been listening to a bunch of your old
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there access to some of your older ones
that are not in the feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not sure how many episodes
Stitcher is holding, but iTunes has the
[SPEAKER_00]: most recent 100 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're able to listen via iTunes,
you can get a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening through my website,
iregeneticscolorado.com, you can go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: iregeneticscolorado.com website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow from your heart podcast
tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take you to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, there should
be 100 episodes available there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will get you all the way back to
we're at 174.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get all the way back to about
75, which that's a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do want the old stuff,
I plan on putting the older episodes back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just redropping them is kind of like new
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add a new intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk to you a minute, let you know
it's a repeat and we'll put the old
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're impatient and you don't want to
wait for that, send me an email and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: consider sending you the files for older
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many I can do at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get several people that want them
together, I'll try to send them in chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are a few of you that want
those old episodes sent in chunks,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email and I'll try to get them
out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this will get something going,
but I do intend on putting them back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like starting around episode 200,
was kind of my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get 200 episodes out and then maybe
once every two weeks or once a week on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday, we'll just plop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to start with one
because one was terrible, but we'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: like episode, old episodes in not perfect
order, but we'll do them in chronological
[SPEAKER_00]: order, but we may skip a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be a way to hear old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really dying to hear those
first few, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, all I do is garden and
listen to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny to hear the ones you
listen to were all the same ones I
[SPEAKER_00]: listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the comic podcasts for sure,
except Bill Burr is at the top of my list
[SPEAKER_00]: and you had him down at the bottom of
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Burr is a bit much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets, I know it's funny that I'm
sitting here doing a podcast by myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to listen to Bill Burr rant by himself
on a podcast sometimes isn't my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talks about shit that I don't,
I'm not a sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks a lot about goddamn sports and I
don't care about football at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I don't listen to Bill Burr
as much as some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of religiously listened to Rogan,
Doug Benson, Joey Coco Diaz, those are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been listening to a podcast
that I think you guys would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give a shout out to my friend,
Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been getting a shout out in the past
few podcasts, but she's been reciprocating
[SPEAKER_00]: on her show.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a great podcast about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her show is called The Spliff Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I say the word spliff
poorly because my voice, my mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: my accent, the word spliff fucking sucks
for my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got a cotton mouth from
smoking this whole joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably saying it even worse,
but the name of her podcast is Spliff,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Spliff, S-P-L-I-F-F, The Spliff
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out Bo Nellis at
the Spliff Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say, hit me back when you get a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you sign the email with the name
Buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I hope this worked out as hitting you
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you an email to let you know,
to listen to this episode, but dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's your official hit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Jess and Buck, I appreciate both
of you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate both of you being interested
in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause and take a
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, I am going to rant a
long time about starting a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project and selecting a good male.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am nicely hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am nicely medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I smoked that whole joint while we
were talking, but something made me want
[SPEAKER_00]: to take some dabs while I was taking a
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a couple of dabs and now my head
is a little spinning and I feel super
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that asked for longer episodes
are truly going to get what you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for in this podcast because I've
been going for 30 minutes now and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just about to get to the main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main topic of course is breeding,
setting up a breeding area and also
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting your males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little bit about
selecting your females for
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have my phone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called, it's just simply Marijuana
Botany by Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend both of those books if
you're going to do any breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to read further about cannabis
growing, I also recommend anything from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like Let's Grow a Pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like all of the Ed Rosenthal Grow
Books.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ed Rosenthal, Oakster Dam course guide
is a great grow book in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but start with the cannabis breeders
Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then move on to marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will have a great basic
understanding of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have an understanding of
cannabis and a kind of an idea for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, you need to build a grow room or
use your existing grow room for a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a breeding room is just like any other
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need it sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a sealed room so that when it is
dark, a light seal is what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it is dark, you cannot have any light
coming into that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever you choose to have your dark
period for 12 hours at a time,
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be no light interruptions,
no light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a room with a light on a
timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a controllable dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to get water to that
room and you need to be able to get old
[SPEAKER_00]: air out and fresh air into that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you already have a grow room,
it probably can be used just like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you need to consider is
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That room is going to get filled with
pollen and wherever you were ducting your
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust, pollen is going to go out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an outdoor garden and
you're ducting your grow room outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be blowing pollen right into your
outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have another grow room that's in
flower, you need to control where that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way to keep tabs on pollen is
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find a way to either spray
yourself, your plants, both for pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get pollen in one room,
you're going to the other flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to hose yourself down and you
need to spray down the female plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want pollinated and that'll keep
the pollen away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you need a grow room with at
least a 600 watt light or larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will say that you can grow with the
400 or a 250 or an LED or a T5,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think a 600 watt light is the
smallest I would use for breeding because
[SPEAKER_00]: I want strong, healthy plants with strong,
healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for an affordable way to
set up a breeding area and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of space or a lot of funding,
you can use a five by five or a three by
[SPEAKER_00]: three grow hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the five by five grow hut
with a 600 watt or a thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 600 watt light is plenty of light for
a five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer I'll put a 600 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter I'll put a thousand in there
because of course you can cool it much
[SPEAKER_00]: more easily in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rooms are cold anyway because it's
freezing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just use that thousand watt light
to keep everything warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take advantage of your surroundings guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a five by five hut, put a 600 watt
light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put a ducted hood in my huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a five by five hut with a
ducted, I think it's like the extra sun
[SPEAKER_00]: six or the day star six, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a basic hood in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got six inch ducting coming off
of both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a hole for the ducting on
each side of the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ducting goes out of each side of
the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on one end I've got a blower with the
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air comes through the carbon
filter, through the blower, through the
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the hut, over the light, out of the
light, out of the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just blows that air into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically blows it into another room for
me is where I have it running.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that does is it keeps the light,
the heat from the light never gets to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into my grow hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of keeps my hut a little bit
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a six inch hole on the roof
of those grow huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a six inch Hydrofarm blower and just
set it on top of the hut, extracting air
[SPEAKER_00]: so it sucks air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you zip up the hut, it kind of
caves in a little bit because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good thing because it's
sucking air in through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sucking in fresh air constantly and
shooting out hot, stale air from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heat rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pulling in cool air from the bottom
of the room that the hut is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just shooting that air to the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always having circulation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a light running.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is being cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got two blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a reflector with a light in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little bit of ducting and a
five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can set up a breeding room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be helpful if you could have a
separate space for your male plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: start flowering and so that you can keep
your males and females apart until the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal time for pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not absolutely necessary if
you're breeding for personal seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep the plants apart for a little
longer, you're able to make a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: seed is mainly the reason for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something else I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about pollen control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen control is hugely important for
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are flowering from the time
they show the hairs, you guys call them
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, those are pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are calyx pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time those appear, that plant is
able to receive pollen and produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plants have pistils,
you need to keep pollen away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg plants cannot be pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not worry about veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have veg plants, they'll be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you put them near flowering plants,
rinse them off with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any pollen that got on them will be
deactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've been in your garden and
your garden has pollen in it, and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been messing with pollen, or if you've
been pollinating your plants, don't go to
[SPEAKER_00]: your friend's house that grow because you
don't want to fuck up their garden and see
[SPEAKER_00]: their whole garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck up someone else's garden with
your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do have a male plant outside,
pay attention to who else is growing
[SPEAKER_00]: around you, and you may be fucking up
someone else's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to pay attention to what's going on
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about getting your room
built.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about pollen control and how
important pollen control is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are breeding, basic nutrients can
be used for your males and females,
[SPEAKER_00]: just your basic flowering newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use real heavy bloom boosters
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your nitrogen, your phosphorus,
your potassium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep some carbohydrates coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe add a little bit of amino acids for
healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, your basic feed is going to
be just fine for your seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a little breeding room built
and we know what to feed our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I feel like it's time to talk about
selecting your plants for a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big part about breeding is having a goal
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have kind of an idea of what
you're trying to create with your breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to make seeds for yourself
so that you can keep growing in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: with fresh seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to breed new strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to take a strain that is
okay and improve it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to back-cross something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're trying to create
or you're trying to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, it's your job to improve the
cannabis plant and not go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seeds that come out of your
breeding project are not better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that they came from, you can throw
the entire project away and start another
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are trying to make something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about selecting
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you will get from the books that
I did not talk about earlier are charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to learn about allele charts
and Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different charts to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to target specific
traits, use charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to create new crosses to
see what you can do with your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, go ahead and throw some pollen
and see what happens, but make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: test those seeds very well before you give
them out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I want to talk about is
using stable females.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will get a clone and
they'll say, hey, I've got this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a male and they put some
pollen on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always grow out a new clone at least two
or three times before you breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put my females through a
rigorous stress test before I breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put my female plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let them flower for seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will completely fuck up the
timer in the grow room on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is to try to make these plants
hermaphrodite by stressing them with light
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, by disrupting their photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn the light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go from 12-12 and then I will turn it
off for 24 hours and then I will turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: on for 24 hours and then I'll put it back
on 12-12 and I'll pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will herm with that much
disruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them take a little more,
so I'll fuck with them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn the light on for 24 hours again
and then turn it off for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then turn it on for six or eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll go right back to the normal
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll do this throughout the bloom
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by day 35, if something has hasn't
hermed, I will consider it probably strong
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to go into a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'll finish it out, but I want
to kind of fuck with these plants and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're hermaphrodite or not on me from
messing with them and causing them stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the people that buy seeds are
going to mess up and I want the progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from my breeding projects to be
a little bit foolproof because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give people a head start and not make them
struggle from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so use females that are tested,
that are trusted, that you've grown
[SPEAKER_00]: several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use females that have desirable
traits that I love that I think I can make
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is kind of like cheffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're about to put ingredients from the
male plant with ingredients from the
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to stir them up and then
you're going to grow that and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cake is your finished buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when you're making a
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a female that's got a good node
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inner node spacing is not too far
apart on the main stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a female that flowers in a good
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like 70 day plants, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like plants that are done
in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a 70 day flowering plant has a
lot of time to get the good quality sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: style THC buzz that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indica plants don't give me that head
buzz that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little longer plant, something that
smells real good and something that just
[SPEAKER_00]: grows real well and is desirable to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a female plant that you want to
breed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants with a lot of resin usually produce
offspring with a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more resinous your female plants,
the more likely you are to produce resiny
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically your favorite females are
great for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows by now what a good female
plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a goal, find a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use more than one female in a
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing stopping you from putting,
I do several females in a room at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them kind of big and then I'll put,
you know, I do probably six, I like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: six, seven gallon pots per a thousand watt
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fed them up to about just between
knee and waist high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say that's probably about,
you know, 20, 24 to 28 inches tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom about that tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's time, I like to give
them pollen and I get plenty of seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes each of those six plants under
one light will be a different strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm creating something new,
I will do six different plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see what I can create.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll run all of those six new crosses
myself to see what I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's something that I love,
I will fill a light with just one strain
[SPEAKER_00]: and repeat the process and make a bunch
more seeds so that we can put them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market or we can just do whatever needs to
be done with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I cross it, I just do a
whole bunch of plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I find the best of that new
cross, the best cross of that new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I repeat those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a process of elimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the things that you see come to
market from me is a very small portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I create.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't continue a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those six that I put under one light,
I'll put six different girls under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use one male and pollinate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two or three of those will get
repeated and the rest will get abandoned
[SPEAKER_00]: and I won't make more of that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put multiple females in the
room for breeding and you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple different crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making seeds for yourself,
that's a really fun way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can find a whole bunch of great
new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to do a little bit of
talking about male selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an entire podcast about selecting
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode number 121 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast is all about male selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a really in-depth podcast
about choosing a male for breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: check out episode number 121.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't want to go back and
listen to that one, here is the short
[SPEAKER_00]: course for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choosing a male is very important because
I think the male will provide a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma, a lot of the structure,
and a lot of the general health of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the pest resistance, the mold
resistance, a lot of that is going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: from your male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I look for in a male plant is
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the plant is shaped is going to
predict a lot of what your females or your
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny are going to be shaped like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want a sativa dominant plant
that gets kind of tall, that grows really
[SPEAKER_00]: tall colas, you want a male that gets tall
and has really tall colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a short stout indica dominant
plant, you want a male that grows short
[SPEAKER_00]: and stout and squat and is shaped the way
you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about what you want out of your
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where having a goal comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So structure is important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like close, close, tight node
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that stem starts growing,
I want a set of branches to come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I want about, you know, an inch and
then another set of branches coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: and then like an inch and then more
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice, close, tight internodal
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I really pay attention to is
the aroma of my male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to rub the stem with my fingers and
then smell my fingers and see what it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant that has a fruity smell is going
to make fruity progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am breeding, I kind of lean towards
the more fuely, more funky sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a male plant that smells like puke
or vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great male for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it passes on great traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I really like to see in a
male plant, and it's kind of odd,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't happen all the time,
but trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love to see trichomes on a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to let them flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to get about four or five,
maybe even six weeks into flower before we
[SPEAKER_00]: see the trichomes and start dropping
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see trichomes on a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is most likely going to make the
plant that I choose for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the fifth one, but probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that flower too early are going
to turn purple when you get a cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn yellow towards the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to find that out,
you guys, is to flower your male plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: come across in the offsprings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eliminate these to 10 weeks just to see
what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what song it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: My male plant is an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male that I have chosen from that is
known as King Solomon because he is the
[SPEAKER_00]: king.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what he looks like nine weeks into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps dumping pollen nine weeks into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant could probably go 10 or 11
weeks, no problem, and stay nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy with the way I feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would look wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what my plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to pass on to your progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it turns orange, if it turns purple,
if it turns yellow, that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, also, speed of development is
something that I pay a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want the male plants that start
flowering early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a 10 pack of seeds,
hypothetically, five of those seeds will
[SPEAKER_00]: be males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want the first two to show me
that they are males and start dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like the third or fourth one is
most likely going to be the plant that I
[SPEAKER_00]: choose for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the fifth one, but probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that flower too early and right
away are going to be too dominant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to pass on way too much of
their traits and they are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow enough of the female traits to come
across in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I eliminate the early flowering males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males that start dumping pollen the
soonest, they usually get cold from my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am paying attention to how long it
takes these plants to show me that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are males, how long it takes for the male
pollen sacs to start dropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also how long it takes for the pollen
sacs to open and start dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things I am really paying
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to pay attention to how much
pollen comes out and how long my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will keep dumping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that really matter to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of pollen is important
because I make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a plant that will keep going so
that I can keep tapping it every couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days and get some more pollen out of it if
I need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a nice robust male.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I will try to find a male
that looks very similar to a female that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I got a 10 pack of seeds and there
was a female in there that I really liked
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the perfect female out of the 10
pack, I hope for a male that has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: shape and the same characteristics as that
female because I know that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass on those traits that I am looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, something that I do not like out of a
breeding plant is something that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: really tall, something that starts
stretching and has a lot of internode
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to make too much fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be more hemp than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to get a big stretchy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I try to stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a male that is just
shooting above the canopy of all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, just pull that one out because it
is going to create problematic progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, mainly you want a male with a good
structure that smells good, that produces
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, that grows the way you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually if you get a 10 pack and you get
five males, you are going to want that
[SPEAKER_00]: third or fourth male is going to be your
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is usually what I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, find the traits to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of notice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for one that looks like a female that
you like and then you should have yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice quality male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it dumps plenty of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it produces nice big fat
flower clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want big tight fat male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want big fluffy sparse male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to look like a big cola of
male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more male flowers, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you are going to pass on that
trait and you are going to produce big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: female buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fat male clusters are going to be a
super desirable trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you should not breed with
you guys, any plant that has ever shown
[SPEAKER_00]: any sign of hermaphrodism, do not breed
with any hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it shows bananas, ever do not breed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now we know how to select females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to select males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is something else I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are breeding to narrow down
specific traits, if you want your progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: to look like a certain thing, then it is a
good idea to select one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a female and you have got
a male and you are trying to get this part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this male and this part of this female
into your cross, it is wise to use one
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you want to open up the
breeding and see what you can create,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is always fun to use multiple males of
the same cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you have got, let us just say a
rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are trying to breed with a rise,
if you want to make a rise to,
[SPEAKER_00]: let us, what did I do a rise to?
[SPEAKER_00]: A rise to lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it a firefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you take a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a rise to lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used one arise male to one lemon skunk
female because I knew what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to put this robust growth from a
rise, this cola size from a rise and this
[SPEAKER_00]: node structure and this thick branching
into this really flavorful yet kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wispy lemon skunk cross that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I knew that I wanted King Solomon by
him self to pollinate that lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: because my goal was the cross of those
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if I wanted to see what I could
create without narrowing it down and since
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on selling these seeds and putting
it to market, I wanted it to be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: close representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be able to predict what I was
making is what I am saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to open up the breeding and
kind of create some chaos, I would put
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple arise males in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow out a bunch of arise seeds
and I would find four males and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: would put those four males in with
whatever female plants I chose to and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would use the pollen from all four of
those arise males and that's called an
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that's going to do, it is going
to show a lot of different phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: because now I've got four different
fathers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to get a lot of recessive
traits from that male line that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: not have brought out by using one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you want to narrow down traits,
if you're trying to narrow down your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and get specific traits out,
use one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to open up the breeding
and find new cool shit, use multiple males
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is called open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the multiple male method or for the
single male method, you can use one female
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can use multiple females,
however you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is when you do harvest,
keep all of those seeds very well labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: and be honest with everybody about the
work that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that are growing the seeds that you
create deserve to know exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough talk about selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got you through choosing
your males and choosing your females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit about timing
your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the male pollen drop and
the female ovulation times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants like to drop their pollen
sometime between day 14 and day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could start a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never seen it start earlier than
day 12 or 13, but around day 12 or 13,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually 14 or 15, those male pollen sacks
are going to open up and pollen is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start coming out of those male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it start any later than
day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rarely takes that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female plants are able to receive pollen
as soon as they have pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see those little white
hairs sticking up out of your female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, they are able to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the ideal time for them to
receive pollen is not until around day 25
[SPEAKER_00]: to 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they receive pollen too early,
you're not going to get a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pollinate too early, your plants
are really little.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of space for a seed to
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not a lot of bud sites,
so you just don't have as many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait too long, your calyx pistols
miss their prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are no longer ready to breed
and you will not make as many seeds as you
[SPEAKER_00]: wish you would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit the pollen onto the females
between days 25 and 32, you will get the
[SPEAKER_00]: most out of your pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here is a big part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing of breeding is a huge
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your male plants are going to start
dropping their pollen around day 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your female plants are not ready for
pollen until around day 25 to 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick is you need to keep that male
plant away from your female plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start them at the same time,
you got to keep them apart for about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days, or you're not going to get as many
seeds as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either keep your male in another
area to where the pollen can't get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start your females a little bit
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start flowering your females 10
days before your males.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, they're 10 days ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when the male starts dropping
pollen, they'll be timed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the females 10 days ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be 25 days into flower when your
male is 15 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll give you a weak window to get the
pollen onto the plants and hopefully you
[SPEAKER_00]: can time it up perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you ran your male plant at
least one time before you bred with him
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know how long it's going to take
for him to start dropping pollen and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes this math equation a little bit
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need him to be dropping pollen when
your plants are 25 to 32 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is you can
collect the pollen in a jar and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: apply it to the plants at the perfect
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good thing about having the pollen in
a jar is that if you are running a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: crop that you don't want to seed
everything, you can pull one plant aside
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can take it to another area and
you can just use a Q-tip and dip that
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-tip into the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply it to a couple of bud sites
that you want to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark that branch so that you know it got
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that plant sit for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that pollen soak in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it do what it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get a sprayer and spray that plant
off with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will deactivate all of the loose
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go to your grow room and spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you cleaned your clothes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to your grow room and spray all of
those plants with water before you return
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant to the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to make just a few
seeds for yourself if you're very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be very careful and you'll get
better at this as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that jar of pollen sitting
there, the options are endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a jar of pollen on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pollination, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of really easy ways to
pollinate your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a male plant that is dropping
pollen and you've got female plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are ready for pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either take the male plant right
into the grow where the females are and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a nice shake and just watch that
cloud of dust come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that pollen is now airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to land on your females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every piece of pollen that touches a
pistol will now be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll become a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have just pollinated your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set that male plant in front of a
fan and just turn the fan on and watch it
[SPEAKER_00]: blow pollen all over your female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut the plant down and carry it
into the room and you can actually smack
[SPEAKER_00]: it up against the female plants if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done and seen this done and it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my male plant way too big the last
time I did a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no moving it because if I would
have moved it, pollen would have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to waste that much pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a small area of females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked over to the male plant and I cut
a branch off of the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut it, a little bit of pollen came
out because of the scissor click.
[SPEAKER_00]: I held the branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it a cut and I walked that branch
over to the females and I held it just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of inches above the female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it a nice shake and you could just
see the cloud of pollen come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it another shake and then I flicked
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a flick, just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of pollen came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably took one medium-sized branch
to pollinate an entire light worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I used two or three branches
because I wanted to make sure to get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can either move the male plant to
the room and leave it alive and give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: shake and let it pollinate naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a fan in front of it and blow
it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually seen guys hit the fan with
the male plant so that way it hits it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it just fucking explodes pollen
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut a branch off and carry the
branch to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another thing that you can do if
you've got a jar of stored pollen and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to teach you how to store pollen
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a jar of stored pollen,
all you've got to do is take that stored
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and I just stick my hand,
my gloved hand into the jar of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a rubber glove on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put the hand right in there and now
my glove has pollen stuck to it and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just go and kind of sprinkle above the
plants and just touch the plants and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will get pollinated by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put some in your hand and blow
it if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to do is get that fancy dust,
that fairy dust, that pixie dust all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the pistols of your girl plants and they
are now pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the plants are pollinated because
when that pollen touches it will take very
[SPEAKER_00]: few minutes but the white hairs that you
guys talk about, the pistols, everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: calls them hairs, the pistols will start
to curl up and turn brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know they've been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start to shrivel up and get weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the leaves will do funky things
when the plants get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all plant-specific but you'll
definitely see the pistols get brown and
[SPEAKER_00]: curved and withered and they'll look like
they expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see those seeds are going to take
about 40 to 50 days to get ready from
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you pollinate on day 25 around day
65 to 75 your seeds will be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it just like normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep feeding it like you normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give it as much boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still flush because there's going to be
material that will be turned into hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about harvesting your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should talk about collecting and storing
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to harvesting your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen collection is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either set a plate, just a white
dinner plate underneath your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't have any fans blowing
or blowers blowing it around the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: will fall directly out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravity will take it right down and it
will gather on that plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a mirror.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use, I used an old drum head one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a 22 inch kick drum head underneath
my male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the pollen that fell landed inside
the kick drum head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got all that pollen
gathered, do not let it get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If water touches that pollen, it's fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the pollen falls onto the plate or
the drum head or whatever it lands onto,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used my ID or a credit card and I just
scoop it up into a nice little pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the pollen to get completely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are little male flowers that fall
in there when you're collecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, pick those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have moisture and they'll
fuck up your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make that pollen inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're patient and you've got the
room and the time, just put something
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath your male plant and let it drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can collect it that way
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the space and you're not
that patient, or maybe you want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more pollen more quickly, an easy thing to
do is I like to cut the branch off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hold it over the plate and I
just tap it with my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right directly onto the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a lot of pollen just
falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a mirror.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a Tupperware dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something glass is ideal because it
doesn't stick as well and it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: static.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got like a mirror or a big
dinner plate or a sushi plate is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut the branch off, hold it over the sushi
plate in a room with no wind and away from
[SPEAKER_00]: all your female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use tap tech is what I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tap that pollen right out of the
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tap it right onto the plate,
right onto the mirror and just let it dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and then scoop it up and put it into a
glass jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good idea to put a silicate
package in there, not a Boveda pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to keep it humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a silicate pack that will dry it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it as dry as it can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull all the male flowers out,
get it in a jar and let it get completely
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to store that pollen,
just put it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to put it in the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a filing cabinet that is in a
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays in the back of the filing
cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry and it's dark and that pollen
stays good for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used that pollen six months after
I've stored it and it has been completely
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good way to catch pollen is a
pollen collection bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends at Hort Solutions on Instagram
sent me these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what this material is made
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thick paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost like a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like a filter for maybe a thick
coffee filter, but they made a bag out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it's got a little clear plastic
window in it so you can see inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this bag is for, you slide it
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would probably fit, if you grew a
small male plant, you could almost fit the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire male plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you trimmed off the lower branches and
just use that one main cola, you could fit
[SPEAKER_00]: an entire plant or a large branch in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would probably be the top cola of one
of my plants would fit right inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you seal it at the bottom with either
some tape or a rubber band.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it starts to pollinate, the pollen
cannot get out of the bag, but the air can
[SPEAKER_00]: flow through the bag so that the plants
will live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't die because they're still
getting light and air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the plant starts to drop its
pollen, you can watch the pollen come out
[SPEAKER_00]: and the pollen doesn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays right inside the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you feel like you've got enough
pollen or like that plant is expired and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to quit making pollen,
you can cut the branch and then open the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take the bud out or the branch of the
plant, take that out, give it a good shake
[SPEAKER_00]: before you take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of your pollen will be
contained inside that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pour that into a jar or
whatever type of container you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it in and then pull out the male
flowers, get your silicate pack in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have got pollen that you
gathered on your own in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this bag works in reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to pollinate one branch of a
plant, so you have that jar of pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take your plant, like I told you,
talked about earlier, take it to a safe
[SPEAKER_00]: place with no wind, use a Q-tip or a paint
brush, dip it into your jar of pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: paint that onto a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put this bag over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that will prevent that pollen
from getting into the rest of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works as a catch or as sort of a
pollen condom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great device.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are interested in one,
they do not pay me to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am checking to make sure I give you the
right web address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is www.hort-solutions.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hort-solutions.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to follow them on Instagram,
it's hort underscore solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product, great way to catch
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how you collect your pollen,
storing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about harvesting your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've been going for an hour and
six minutes and honestly, my voice is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start going a little more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvesting seeds is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any other harvest, about 14 days
before you begin harvesting, start
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is feed your plants
clean pH balanced water for the last 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days of your flowering cycle and your
plants, your buds will taste much better
[SPEAKER_00]: when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I know we're growing seeds right now,
but there is going to be material left
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to turn it into extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why people don't flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 14 days that you don't have to use
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is going into the plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get why people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 14 days before harvest, start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two or three days before you chop down the
plants, go in the grow room and pull off
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the large leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any big leaf with a petiole, any leaf
that's in the way, go ahead and take it
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to get harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not need those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at harvest time, here is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to chop down the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hang that plant upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a label on it so I know exactly what
plant that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write the date on it so I know what day
I chopped it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let the plants hang upside down
until they are crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we're pulling seeds out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to dry and cure this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you let it get too dry,
seeds will start falling out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is put something
underneath each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave them far enough apart to where if
I've got strain A and strain B and seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: fall out, I know that those seeds are not
going to mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a drum head or a box or some sort
of catch container underneath the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to catch any stray seeds that fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't even care about the
stray seeds that fall out because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: so many that I don't even worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sweep them up and they go in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they get given away as mystery
seeds to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hang the plants upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them get crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants get nice and dry and
crispy, I cut them into sections that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more manageable and I put them in a long
Tupperware container and I just let them
[SPEAKER_00]: dry even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a whole bunch of strain A,
I will put all of strain A into one
[SPEAKER_00]: container if it fits and then I put on
some rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I just start mushing up the
buds with my fingers and it just starts
[SPEAKER_00]: crumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just starts falling apart and you can
just hear the seeds come raining out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds just come falling out of the
buds if you did it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut down the plants, let them dry until
they're crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them into manageable sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in a container, either a pie
plate, a Tupperware container,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of thing that when the seeds
fall out, it's not going to roll away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start crushing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crush it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear the seeds come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have little stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have dried bud material
and you're going to have seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw all the stems away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put all the seeds in a jar and then you've
got a bunch of bud material that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: either make edibles out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it to a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like to make hash with my
material that comes from my seeded plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think something happens to the
plant when it gets seeded and the oil that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash oil that comes from it seems to
get me a little bit better of a high,
[SPEAKER_00]: a different high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it does something that
normal hash doesn't do when it's made from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were not seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you harvest your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically cut down the plants,
let them dry, put it over a container and
[SPEAKER_00]: crumble the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you get a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have big round tiger stripe
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I like to do that you may
want to do when you think the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting close to ready, you'll be able to
see them in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with going to a
lower part of the plant and popping out
[SPEAKER_00]: one seed every now and then and
investigating it until you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to ruin one or two seeds and
cut down the whole plant early and ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 30 days after pollination,
I'll go in there and I'll just pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not going to be ready,
but now I've got an indicator of where I
[SPEAKER_00]: am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to wait until the seeds that I pull
out are hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to put it on a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting at a wooden table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a wooden table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to set the seed on this table and
push with my finger as hard as I can and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want that seed to crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't push as hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't hurt yourself, but you want
to be able to push nice and hard on that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and you don't want them to crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're white, if they're soft,
they're not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want big, fat, fluffy tiger stripe
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seeds that I make do not ever get a
tiger stripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn this gray color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all seeds are going to get a tiger
stripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I need to talk about you
guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that asked for a long podcast,
you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an hour and 11 minutes in and I have
still got a little bit of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
this long episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm starting to get rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to get tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is wearing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storing seeds is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep my seeds in a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them sealed and I keep them in a
cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually in a very similar place
to where I keep my pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to do is to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to mention is please do
not sell untested seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make some seeds, grow them,
germinate them, write down how many you
[SPEAKER_00]: started, write down the germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get at least a 70%
germination rate, try two or three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get at least a 70%
germination rate, something's wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not need to be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell untested seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower them all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are hermaphrodites, don't sell
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not quality seeds that make
quality plants, do not sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If seven out of 10 of those plants that
come out of there are not something you
[SPEAKER_00]: would be proud of smoking and be proud of
posting a picture of all over Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: do not put that seed line out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are better seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow them yourself if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fine, but please do not put them
in the hands of unsuspecting growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give your seeds away to your
friends if you tell them, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, I haven't tested this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, dude, I'm not sure what this is going
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give those away, but please do not
try to make any money off of untested
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mislead people with what you're
giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you, like I said a minute ago,
it's okay to toss something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a cross, if you take pollen
and put it on this plant and you make a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seeds, and you grow 100 of those
seeds and they are not way improved on
[SPEAKER_00]: what you started with, if the buds that
come out of that are not better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that came from the original female
plant, you did not do any justice to that
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep seeds just out of pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be prideful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be arrogant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of some shit that is not
contributing to making cannabis a better
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to toss bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wasting time growing shitty
seeds, you were cock blocking yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: from growing good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could throw away that bad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could plant more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I really wanted to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you got a bunch of seeds
that you made yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to grow them and find out
what you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always the funnest part right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what comes from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you made a whole bunch of freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you just made the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you could have made
until you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just making seeds for yourself,
you can stop or you can keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step would be to make an F2,
which would be to find a male and a female
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the perfect traits and breed
them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are called F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find the perfect male and the
perfect female out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed those together again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be your F3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that come out of there will be
the F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea then is to keep going all the way
to F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get to F5, every seed that
you crack will come out looking like a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have exactly what you want nailed
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're just making these
seeds for your own personal garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can stop right here where you are with
this original cross and you can have fun
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can cross those seeds to more
and you can cross those to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the options are endless once you get
this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got one more part to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause and take a dab
and a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, I'm going to talk
about keeping male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to wrap up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a quick talk about keeping male
plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep male plants just like I keep a
female mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep it in a semi large pot,
a five gallon or bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep it in an air pot or a root
pot, that is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is to keep the plant
from getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the root pots kind of do a
little bit of root pruning for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants won't get root bound because
when they do get root bound, you'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing stress problems and some plants
like to try to auto flower if they do get
[SPEAKER_00]: root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a big pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a nicely aerated soil or a soilless
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it makes a little bit of cocoa in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ideal to keep your mother or father
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a father plant is what I would
call this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ideal to keep your mother and father
plants under either 18, six or 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous light.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I have shifted to that I
learned from DJ short, I run a 19 five
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle for my mother and father plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like 19 hours on gives them plenty
of time for growth and the five hours off
[SPEAKER_00]: gives everything time to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody wants time to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want to sleep and also my
equipment needs some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the five hour break is good for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the shorter rest period because
that way I know that none of my plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to decide that they're going to try
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get to keep my mother plants
and father plants forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you do keep a plant for a long
time, if it's around for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hormones move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it will get old and it will try
to flower on you if you give it some
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes plants will try to auto flower
on you if they get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep them under the 19 hours
on five hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do 18, six, or you can do 24 hours
on all three of these options will work
[SPEAKER_00]: just depending on the strain that you've
got and what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to keep it in a large pot,
good soil, keep it on a vegetative light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something that I like to do is I
take a lot of clones from it and I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: prune it very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also keep a backup of my male plants
somewhere else in a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: location so that if something does go
wrong with King Solomon at the A location,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a clone of King Solomon at the B
location just because he's my prize male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you keep your plant in a
large pot with good soil under a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative light, it should continue to
veg indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to take clones off of
it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed my mother and father plants
just basic vegetative nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them grow A and grow B or whatever
grow nutrients you're using, maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little cow mag occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to feed them kelp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I take clones between 12 and 24
hours before cutting clones, I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray my plants with a kelp product,
maybe liquid karma or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mix up some liquid karma, adjust the
pH and foliar spray your mother or father
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before taking clones is some great
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email that I read at the start of the
show actually said that the listener keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: their mother plants in two gallon pots and
keeps them about two feet tall and does
[SPEAKER_00]: some root pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that we get a reply from
them and they are going to teach us how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will teach you guys how to do that
in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, my throat and my
voice are burnt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time for me to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go, I want to tell you about a
service called Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a service that will allow my
listeners to make a financial contribution
[SPEAKER_00]: to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get rich off this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking anybody to pay for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast will always be free because
it comes from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want everybody that listens to grow
better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you feel like this episode was
worth a dollar or $2 or however much you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like it was worth, if you would like
to make a contribution, all you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is go to patreon.com slash grow from your
heart, make yourself a little Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: account, type in the dollar amount that
you would like to contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contribute as little as $1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly don't think there is a
limit on how many zeros you type in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be grateful for a $1 contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to do with that dollar is
I'm going to continue to keep my website,
[SPEAKER_00]: iregeneticscolorado.com alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website is where I host this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay for that website myself out of my
pocket every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is $315 annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like your help to offset the
cost of my website to keep this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to you for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never ask anybody to pay for the
show, but if you feel like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute, I would appreciate your
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it is patreon.com slash grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I also have a huge shout out to

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for making the long drive down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a big deal to come here and
hang out with you, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have a long time listener
and a long time friend here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen you in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, I don't know, like three or
four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a little bit busy, but hey,
you know, we're just talking for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both parents and we're both proud
poppers of beautiful girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let them consume our lives,
which is definitely a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, big shout out for being a good
father, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family is the number one thing.
Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Family, family, family.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go give your, go give your kids a
hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about taking a fat dad and
give your mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go give your kids a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out with them for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss them on the forehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how old they are, boy or a girl,
go embarrass the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go kiss them right on the forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when their friends are around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brother man, how can people find you on
social media so that they can stalk you
[SPEAKER_00]: while they listen here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook, Sammy John Claus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean shoes, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened is my buddy, he used to make
himself up a bunch of cool names on
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook, like Al Guapo and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was clowning him telling him,
give me a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called me Sammy John Claus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the chocolate, you can't mess
with the chocolate, so whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Instagram and everywhere else,
it's the painted chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: The painted chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go follow my friend, the painted
chef, check him out so that you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: how sexy he is so that you can see his
beautiful garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a wonderful ganja grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot from a lot of people,
but I just try to do my best and give the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants all the love I can, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite thing about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were saying a minute ago that you're
trying to get your name in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and get your foot in the door,
basically, and get to be known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you are a humble dude and
you're not so worried about getting out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and getting known.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that when the time is right for
you, it will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are a ganja soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a warrior and you're doing it kind
of behind the scenes and low key,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're doing it with a lot of heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Instagram followers are
cool, but putting heart into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing stuff for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it's all about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to focus on me and doing my
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, my little family,
you know, that's the main motivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people have been affected
by cannabis and need cannabis help or are
[SPEAKER_01]: against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just always trying to go push it
forward the best way I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the love I can because that's the way
I was raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love in everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love in everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already thank you for joining me,
but I want to thank you for backing me up
[SPEAKER_00]: on Facebook the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sammy and I, I was a member of a Facebook
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Sam is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I call you Sam or Sammy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you want, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't called anything from Jim to Bob,
so it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to stick with something close to
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I was in a Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am no longer a member of that group,
but I don't have any issues with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to sound like an asshole,
but people post the dumbest shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like, I've got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, you should pee in your
plants and then put baking soda and
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegar on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: People, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to Google or do anything for
themselves at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I get mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm like, why are you asking
what you can do with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you know you can go Google this,
this is one on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a one on one thing,
go Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably in a book that says cannabis
growing on the front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just bought a cannabis growing
book, you could go to the glossary or the
[SPEAKER_00]: index, look for your problem, find it,
turn to that page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd find tried and true solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you want to go to Facebook and
ask some dude with a clever fucking name
[SPEAKER_00]: who doesn't even have pictures of a grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like telling you to do the
weirdest shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll go in there and I'll be like,
no, you shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will give a factual reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will state a positive way to
improve your solution so that that way
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you're not, cause a lot of the
things they say will cause you even more
[SPEAKER_00]: problems than you started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people hate on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cause you're an expert doesn't mean
we can all do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're afraid of a little bit
of work and spending a couple of bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to make as much as they can off
of this crop without putting any energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and money into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that day, that's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I jumped in it because I'll see
them going at you, but you can handle your
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you know your stuff, but when they
attack, like calling you an asshole and
[SPEAKER_01]: all this shit, I can't handle that because
just one of the best dudes I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, since I met you,
you know, whatever we've been friends or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I see that happening,
I won't allow it and I'll come in and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: interject and get your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll try to challenge my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, come on, I'm not,
I don't know everything, but you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're messing with a big dog here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm gone too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't want to be put in their
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They booted me real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kept a screenshot of me,
what they were saying, which was rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, they're trying to say this,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tried to back me up and tell you,
you're like, you don't, you said something
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you don't even realize the wealth
of knowledge you just eliminated from this
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those people, they have no idea
what's even happening when I'd comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look at me like, they call me a
know it all and try to talk shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I'm really trying to help
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, if I went over your head and I feel
like a lot of the problem is ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bruise some egos and then, and I don't
know it all also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know how I did learn, I'll admit a
lot of the way I learned things was by
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way you learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to learn unless you try
and fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a lot of mistakes and I'm
willing to admit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm willing to share my mistakes with
people and they don't even realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying I did what you're trying to do
and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and they just get mad at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of doing all the trial and error
that I did, I'm going to tell you how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe it's not the nicest because
you're not understanding through text,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to lead you astray and like mess
your plants up worse just cause you
[SPEAKER_01]: listened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin your plants because some dude
on Facebook with the cool name taught you
[SPEAKER_00]: to spray something on your plants in week
nine of flowers so that you could solve
[SPEAKER_00]: your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, I'm glad that, dude,
I've got cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have as wicked bad cotton mouth as I
do those tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my dry face on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the biggest dabber, but one kind
of small dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm yeah, I'm feeling it brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another person here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took a dab and she is now tucked in,
in bed, probably snoring like a champion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking forward to trying to just
distill it because I never have,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to wait till after now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you saw what it did to her,
you kind of change your whole mind on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to talk to the people,
not just laugh at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet dreams down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's going to listen to this show
later and be like, okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of glad that those people are
failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the forums and on Facebook
groups because it's those groups kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to me starting this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was hanging out at Maddie's house
late at night and answering grow
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what contributed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and there was another podcast I would
listen to and people would ask questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and instead they'd be like, I have spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of saying fix the room,
find the mites, clean up, and then maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: use a type of product, they would say,
Oh, go to the store and buy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get this store made by this
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get at this website for this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them that sales this code,
which is my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh, you're making a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't even a real email from a real
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could feel that from a very specific
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that podcast kind of inspired me to do
a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, Tim, Tim Martin had a
podcast for a little while there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: JDR, the John Doe radio that inspired
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then coral, a coral reefer,
of course, I wanted to fill the gap that
[SPEAKER_00]: she was missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did all the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do the gross stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, Adam L had a fun podcast
with his, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to kind of join that vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of, so all that stupid
stuff is what I'm getting at is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the Facebook group sucking and then all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to help people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of why I started the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without all those crappy info avenues,
the show probably would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's a good thing that those
things out there, I guess the bad things
[SPEAKER_01]: always come a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why not lead people the right way,
you know, in a fun way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of making it boring, someone wants
to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much easier to listen than to read
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can absorb this show while you're
driving down the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be on your way to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be in your cubicle with an
earbud in, you could be doing whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: do and listen to a podcast to learn how to
grow weed and meet Sammy the painted chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are scrolling through his
Instagram right now and checking them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason that feels weird when I
say that, but I hope you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, let's talk about your growing
history and stuff, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give you some credibility here on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're cool as shit, but nobody
else here has met you before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, back in the day, uh, I always had
my mind in it, you know, since,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, eighth grade, whenever I
first tried marijuana, I always wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I was old enough to do my own
thing, I started just dabbling with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: playing with it and, uh, reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read for about 10 years before I ever
put a seed in the ground, just because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, knowledge is power and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I encourage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just so happened that,
uh, I think I joined Roll It Up or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, one of the old forums that
existed back in the day and I discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause me and my buddy were looking for a
soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're up in Denver, going to start
growing, going to get going on it and
[SPEAKER_01]: found that forum, you know, a lot of good
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's still out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone wants to check it out,
you can learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, um, it was that I met a lot of
good people through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met all the guys over at geek,
uh, geek farms out in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geek Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geek Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those guys, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Samson Mallory while we're at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Raya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Andrew B.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cat's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I met all those guys, you know,
and we just started talking on the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started learning from them and taking
what they taught me, applying it to my
[SPEAKER_01]: plans, trial and error, doing my thing,
having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first one I grew was a purple
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the clone of it was my own first
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My ex-wife at the time surprised me for a
gift, like got me a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to let me grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went full bore, you know,
and that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, just learn, learn more,
learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything progressed and I got to where I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started working over at a concentrate
products in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great place to work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many lights were you running over
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was eight rooms, 75,000 Watts per
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 2000 plants at all times in
there and, uh, learned a lot, learned a
[SPEAKER_01]: wealth of knowledge over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys were good, but you know,
I'm not there anymore and looking to do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that I can, you know,
just progress more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much my story in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got so much heart,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I love about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I noticed about the
cannabis industry though, is people just,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't stay in the same place for very
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go in and, you know, I don't mind doing
the bounce around because I love seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility and learning as much as I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, I've, I've kind of,
it's like a class, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, I made all the friends I want
to make here and I've learned as much as I
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to go find another
facility to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I am now keeps me really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep, they keep accidentally putting
bonuses on my paychecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't argue with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat me really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super cool people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I learned most of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed nerds everywhere, every nook and
cranny, you know, you can find us always.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have weed nerd stuff wrote down to talk
about later, but we can go that way if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's introduce the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a lot of my listeners aren't
familiar because people are listening in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia and countries I can't even
pronounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make that mistake a lot to assume
everyone knows who and what the weed nerds
are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a guy, a group of people,
but mainly it's led by the ringleader is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dude by the name of Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's on Instagram, but they keep
deleting him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Subcool420 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's what it is, but I'm not a
hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
they will have deleted him.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have a new account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so his name is Subcool and he runs a
seed company called TGA Subcool Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: TGA stands for the Green Avenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are known for strains like Space
Queen and Vortex and Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jilly Bean actually, let's talk about
another member of TGA, Ms. Jill,
[SPEAKER_00]: MZ period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill made a strain called Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Jelly, it's Jilly because it's
named after Ms. Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Subcool's wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a badass grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a cool lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does some breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made the Brian Berry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is part of the TGA Subcool family.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Jinx Proof who made the nine
pound hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a crazy cat, but I like watching him
blow his glass over there on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his be positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a child with autism and he also
suffers from a seizure condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his be positive attitude is just really
cool to see him use cannabis in a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: way and educate everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so shout out to the whole Weed
Nerd crew, but that's who we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool is the ringleader of the Weed
Nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the leader of the TGA Subcool Seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got a side company known as
Natural Homegrown Wonders, which are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of Subcool's best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Weed Nerds are, so he does a show
on YouTube called The Weed Nerd and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can watch him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a little head banging.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a little ganja teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll speak his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I better give him some credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of inspired this podcast too on
accident, I think, without me even
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing it because it's the same damn
format now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without Sub, I wouldn't be growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be where I am for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: My photography, you could tell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made photography what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and Nugbuckets, Nugbuckets,
that's where I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nugs takes the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another guy, Freebie.
And TC.
[SPEAKER_00]: TC Curtis, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Spliff, a bunch of great cannabis
photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sub's got a show called The Weed Nerd
and then all of the folks that follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: show and are on the show are considered
Weed Nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a Weed Nerd Nation and it's a
big group of folks that have heart about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, that love to grow and breed and
support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bunch of Weed Nerds is
basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I endorse you to go encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said endorse, but I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go check out some Weed
Nerd stuff, check out some Subcool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have a lot of opinions
about Subcool and his products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but go see for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people have opinions about people,
but if your attitude doesn't match with
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else's, look past that and look to
what they're bringing, look to their
[SPEAKER_01]: message and you can learn a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people probably don't realize how
many strains Subcool has brought to market
[SPEAKER_00]: that are amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plushberry was a Subcool creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plushberry, the original, they're bringing
her back, but there's some stuff there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, Plushberry is one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Ms. Jill was making a bunch of
Plushberry seeds recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I loved, I've bred with Plushberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really cool purple phenotype of
Plush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that, what you've bred with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what made the Black Cherry count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's some fire right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get onto that later, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That jelly bean too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking on Facebook a little
bit and you actually wanted to talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about LED growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: LED growing, I use it for veg when I've
got a full thing going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it because of course it saves power.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know how to use them, you can use
them right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people who like to put
them down real close to the plant because
[SPEAKER_01]: they think the closer the better,
but there's actually an opportune,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you want to say range there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 18 to 12 or 18 to 24 inches
away from your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beans focus and you can actually tell
when you're adjusting your light,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look at the shadow, the way the
color split.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you do that, they just take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that's actually right with just
about every light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find, I'll call it the sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get too close, you can probably
tell yourself, when you get too close,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start backing off a little bit,
you can tell, oh, that's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you go a little further,
you're like, oh, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: light on my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants can tell the same damn thing
and they want that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to find out with an LED and you
say it's 18 to 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been out of my own grow for a while
because I've been bouncing around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I believe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks right to me from what I see in
all the pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't realize that the
lenses have a different angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like 60, 90, and 120,
the way the beam shoots out of the lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 90s will shoot them straight down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go for a 90, so I know all that light is
just going straight to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right to your leaves, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can take that into account and get
what you're going, you can do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: good with your LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are either afraid
or mad because they don't understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: to really roll with the LED because they
bought one for $25 off eBay, put it two
[SPEAKER_01]: inches from their plant, and their plant
did nothing but give them a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are afraid to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new plants, the lights they have
coming out are doing some good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not Mr. In the LED light
industry, but- Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a brand that you've had good
experience with or a brand that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the top of my head, I wouldn't want to
just ramble off and give them- I respect
[SPEAKER_01]: that more than you trying to spit
something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather not answer than make people
mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plead the fifth is always the best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said ex-wife earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never miss an opportunity to keep your
mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything major I'm going to have
to do other than finding that sweet spot
[SPEAKER_00]: and the major difference between growing
from an HID, like a high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: to- Watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering is going to be different.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't use as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as hot in the room, so it doesn't
evaporate as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to watch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it myself, got some fungus
gnats, kicked myself in the ass a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: times, but you just got to watch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to watch your watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I adjust from doing that to
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess he was undercut a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting the penetration.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we mean is clean up the underskirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's leaves on the bottom of the plant
that aren't really necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just little shitty growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tiny, just crappy veg
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to turn into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to trim fluffy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut that off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy where that was being wasted
will now go up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a fatter chunkier bud up at the
top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up that underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for clearing the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to clean up the
underside a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pull the plants out a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them so you can get more light to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little bit more pruning probably,
like de-foliate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then water a little bit less frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to have to change your
feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than the amount of water,
are you going to have to change your
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding measurement?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always just kept it the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go from LED straight to under-HID.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of rough on them, but hey,
they're tough plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think treating them a little bit rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants, they're meant to be outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before, they grow on a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Afghan plants in Afghanistan,
they'd grow on a rocky mountainside where
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind would blow on it and the sun
would beat on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get rained on and a goat would
piss on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are meant to be durable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sissy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardy, hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the strongest plants there are
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it weed for a reason is what
Mike always says.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it, even if you have to
try to almost kill this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something that I have learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put it through some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may spit out some seeds you don't want
it, but it's still going to survive
[SPEAKER_01]: through all the stress you give it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're dragging it right from the
LEDs under the HIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow more stretchy or does it stay
bushier with the LEDs?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll start to compact more and get a
little bit more bushier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a couple of weeks of a little
bit more veg under the HID before I flip
[SPEAKER_01]: it and put it in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get them a little bit more used to
the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you notice a stretch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it stretch at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: It stretches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep them real small.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size pots are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just out of curiosity now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using a little one gallon inside a six
by six, a three by three by six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little sea of green type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those little tiny salads like that
with little pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually running a pheno hunt on...
Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep drinking Dr. Pepper to try to get
rid of the dab throat here and it's making
[SPEAKER_00]: a terrible combo of burps and throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a pheno hunt in solo cups and
I've just got them in a little tray so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can water the tray and it absorbs
the water, but it's working pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done it like that, but you can
fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fit 28 cups in one of these trays
and then I eliminated close to half of
[SPEAKER_00]: them because they're male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled the boys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 14 or 15 males per tray and
they fit beautifully in there and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: pour water in the tray, but I just got
them in solo cups and I love a tiny grow
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day once in a while I like to do a
solo cup challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was on the forums, that's always
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a bunch of people go in a whole plant
in a solo cup, see what you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but maybe depending on how long I
let them go, two, three inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll stretch real nice, real quick for
me and then I'll flip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of, I guess it's more of a
height thing for me than a time thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never put anything on a timer or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I try to have a height
schedule, but I just broke my schedule by
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, by five days a couple of days ago
because like these plants are too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked in there and I was like,
no, these must go into flower now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower in me kicked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, forget a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I turned into Ari Shafir in my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just realized, but I was like,
I got to flower these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, I just listened to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, our schedules are fine for a good
little rule of thumb, but the plant will
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you what it needs, what it wants to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't do what it doesn't want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't force it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can force it to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the only thing you can force
it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned, I've learned to force it to
do some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've forced girls into boys, but anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of, I just dragged plants into
flower, you guys, just to give you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: an update on some new shit I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently purchased the entire setup of
veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the base newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the shine and I got the push foliar
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just put some grateful dog plants
into flower and they are getting fed the
[SPEAKER_00]: full veg bloom plus a little bit of aminos
from photosynthesis plus, plus
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally they're getting a little bit
of humble honey is what they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: fed for carbohydrates and that yucca
extract just to give them a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little moisture, a little fluff,
a little taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just went into flower a few days
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in like nine weeks, I'll let you know
how they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first memory of you is that grateful
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of my top five of all
time, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm going to write grateful
dog on here as number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put myself as one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top five is going to be that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to say the blue Jay was
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love the blue Jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what that cross is?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from geek Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Julie bean, the marmalade phenol
cross with Oregon blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Oregon blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Durbin Durbin is always one of my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love me a good Durbin, a critical mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my most recent favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that five?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if we did critical mass, Durbin
poison, Oregon blues, the blue one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't read the next word from and the
grateful dog, but you can keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else you got on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Who?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love me some doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I had to remind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine pound hammer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was Dr. Who from jinx proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Who was from Odie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Odie diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Oregon boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let me see, uh, agent orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really good taste of agent orange
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember him cannabis,
cannabis coal or cannabis kit,
[SPEAKER_01]: whichever one his name sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, he lived up in the mountains here in
Colorado and I went to see him one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me some tasty, tasty agent orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it tastes like I bit of Valencia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that, uh, that orange velvet clone
that miss Jill had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of disappeared, but you know,
sometimes we got to disappear in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then let me see a lot of the old
school growers from like overgrow and from
[SPEAKER_00]: that generation, they all just disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they had to, there was just,
you know, people had to take off too much
[SPEAKER_01]: too quick is what happened.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that just knocked my socks
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have tried of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we might fix that before you leave
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, what's your favorite strain
to grow, to grow, uh, to date,
[SPEAKER_01]: my favorite one to grow would probably be
the, um, uh, the, uh, blue jade.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue jade was a fun one to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown it in a minute,
but it was easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds were nice and pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about an easy strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're just like, ah, an easy grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one recently, river song.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been trying to get out of
my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: A river song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that one on there because river song
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the cross on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: River song was, oh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a riot of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I love out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to think about it and get back
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that Oregon blues out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to taste that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to get ahold of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's what they're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One Nugbuckets is working on one with that
river song called crooked city blues or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the river song crossed with,
um, oh shit, now I'm going to draw a
[SPEAKER_01]: blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be like, Oh bro, it's totally
acceptable to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out that stuff coming out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got it all up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you reminded me when you got here
that I gave you your very first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I, I, that was like when everything
was first starting to get going with the
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs and everything and you know,
the butane and everything, my lungs,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but just there, give me a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that, that day we, that was like
our second time meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were we in line for the cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave you a dab in the line,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking joints and I was like,
well, let's get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there were people like from
Florida around us and we were just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs and everyone's eyes were like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People did not know what to think of the
guy with dreadlocks giving dabs to his
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I wasn't going to be,
be like that about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're a person over here taking
dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, yeah, that was a fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I had fun all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just held around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you would call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You helped me out with something on that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to call you out on air on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause yeah, but you helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sammy saw a door that was open and helped
me walk through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably saved me like a good hour and a
half in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to go to stuff like that,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standing in line sometimes for a cannabis
event in the hot sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you paid a lot of money to get into
that place and you got to just stand
[SPEAKER_00]: outside all day because they're not
prepared.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any predictions or have you
heard any news for the cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver or Colorado or anything for 2020
this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: After last year, all that fiasco,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kind of over it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I've been too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to, usually by this time of year,
I start getting prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started getting seeds on deck and
packaged up and having some ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what I'm going to do and start
looking at hotels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is honestly the first conversation or
thought I've put into it so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that first year that I went,
it was kind of like, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back to my family.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: High times.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on for the cannabis cup this
year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado misses you, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw in a shameless
advertisement because I have to do an
[SPEAKER_00]: advertisement in this podcast and I didn't
do it, but I missed the podcast because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get to see my friends from Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, I tried to be smooth about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed the cannabis cup because I don't
get to see my friends from Handmade
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are so cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Adam is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jackie's cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole crew that they bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's cool is they bring the oil
slick crew with them because they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get the oil slick crew and
the handmade crew together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get goofy and take a bunch of dads
and high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their shirts are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not wearing it for a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually wearing an irie genetics or a
hoodie or a girl from your heart hoodie or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, but their printing is so
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to print.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had graphic artists turn me down to
print my stuff because it's too many
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and it's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, it's going to cost them like
20 bucks a shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, but Handmade Apparel
does them very affordably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm getting at you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out handmadeapparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make t-shirts, hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will print whatever you need printed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the art in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam's an amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make hat pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get some stuff made from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you're listening to the
Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running a super great special
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to quote prices because it
may change by the time you listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, but please check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect to the Handmade
Apparel crew and the oil stick crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys out there on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everything is well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely do yourself a favor with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need shirts, they're the place to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They print all the industry shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where Subcool gets their shirts
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where I get all my shirts done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the Girl From Your Heart hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting in a box over there behind
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The print on those things is so bold,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird wearing a hoodie with
my face on my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine that, but hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how life goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a hoodie with your face on your
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people have a hoodie with
their show on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you leave here, you might have
a hoodie with my face on your back,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you might have some iRegionetics
flowers in your lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I wouldn't be upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make everybody happy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you know what I've noticed,
and I'm trying to make it sound organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I did write this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chefs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chefs are always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, but a lot of good growers and
breeders are also good chefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're the painted chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made comments on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I said I burned myself,
and he told me to rub mustard on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like, rub mustard on it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do that because all I had was
that French's crap, and that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're supposed to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that mustard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really mustard?
[SPEAKER_01]: That French is like- What it basically is,
it holds vinegar on it, and the vinegar
[SPEAKER_01]: will kill the swelling and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned that from my grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an old grandma trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace, grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my grandma too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably up there cooking
together, sharing the recipes.
Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about chefs being good growers is
where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez, I threw myself way off talking about
our grandmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumble, ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we grandma ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chefs are good growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there's anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the flavor or is that the work
ethic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably all of it, and attention to
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said that because I made some
notes and that wasn't one of the things I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a chef, I'm not going to get on
that whole kit because cooking a chef are
[SPEAKER_01]: two things, but if you got to put plates
together, you got to get down into it and
[SPEAKER_01]: get everything together and get the good
flavors coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay attention to every detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to look at every tomato when you
slice it and make sure it's not a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit mushy or a little too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the chef that cuisine for a
five-star establishment at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I call myself a chef because I
was a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me my whole kitchen to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in charge of everything,
but it was my artwork on a plate,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that detail had to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone didn't do it right,
watch out because here comes Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be a perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do that, and that just
transfers over to the world of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier in a grow because you don't
have a time limit to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get this plate out in this amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think chefs can make the adjustment
better and be better at this because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: less stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same amount of work and the same
amount of fun if you're that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that because you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the chefs, I've worked with several
chefs in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have several chef friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that works in the kitchen loves
to consume some cannabis before,
[SPEAKER_00]: during, and or after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am associated with a lot of people in a
kitchen environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all that special kind of crazies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can work a 12-hour shift and then
drink for eight hours right after work and
[SPEAKER_00]: then sleep for four hours and be back at
it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, how the hell do you guys do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're outside the kitchen with a
chef, you'll hear him saying, I hate the
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen, but you get them in that kitchen,
get that pressure going, and every chef
[SPEAKER_01]: loves that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about that pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am no good in a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would know the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lost in a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd throw me the hell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd cut myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be over quickly, but I love pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to work under pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys at work look at me like,
you should probably slow down because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be out of work by noon if
you keep going that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any other speed than turbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, turbo is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun getting work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look back and you're like,
look at all this shit I just got done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're covered in sweat and your back
hurts, but you're like, yeah, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other guys are trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I'm done an hour early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take dads and hang out with
my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still over there trying to puddle
buckets into- Five tables back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, five tables behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think chefs make great growers and
breeders that work ethic, that attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say the cleanliness,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can't do anything without
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you can, but you don't want to eat
at those restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've gotten sick from a non-clean
restaurant before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to eat out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because of the cleanliness,
yeah, but it's mainly because the way
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation happens and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not perfect, I'm pretty mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughters are always like, dad,
don't, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll see my face change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you do what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the hardest thing just to keep your
mouth shut and not let that eye bulge out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh God, I don't want to say
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If their food's messed up, oh,
watch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get in the manager because those
are my girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, that's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to protect the ladies like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just silently eat it and then get up and
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, thanks for that shitty
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be like that until I got deep
into my chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I know what it takes to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can do that, you guys should be able
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost any restaurant where we live around
here, it's all like pre-prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: In most restaurants now, it's all
pre-prepped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just got to go in there and pour the
bags into the thing and put the right
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce on top of it and bring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't even put the three bags
together and heat them up properly for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you cooked on this was the
patty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to call out the restaurant,
but I went to a restaurant that they get
[SPEAKER_00]: rave reviews on the internet and they are
decorated up like they're fancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act like they're real fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of gave that one person in there
gave me a sort of a look when I came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm 6'5 and I have dreadlocks
to my ass and I was walking through a
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my dreads tied up, but they still
looked at me like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had bright red eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just took in a dig in a dab in the
car, but they served us, uh, what are they
[SPEAKER_00]: called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raviolis is an appetizer, but the plate
came with, uh, I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a light colored sauce with a dark
colored swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was real fancy looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just smacked the microphone,
making a swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it had the Raviolis on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a little side of marinara
and a side of another sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'd put like fresh Parmesan or
something on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that looks fucking
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab me one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bite out of it and I'm 95% sure
that is the same frozen Ravioli that I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought at Sam's club that I have in my
freezer over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt embarrassed for myself for
getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh, that's a fucking, you were
fooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I felt bad for the whole
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh wait, they just lost all
credibility to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an industry wide thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, it sucks because
people are going out there thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to get this great meal when
you can go to Walmart and pick it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw some stuff together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get some ragu, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably could have microwaved those
things myself and not, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I look at it is why I charge so
much when you're just doing something that
[SPEAKER_01]: someone could do for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can do a little better,
make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't charge so much, get more people and
have fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was money hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see eye to eye with a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I jumped out of being a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got tired of, um, working, working,
working to put money in other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: pockets when they're keeping me at minimum
wage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, thank God for Colorado
being smart and let me grow cannabis where
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in, you know, love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love Jeff for letting us grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so many things line up for being a
chef and yeah, I love your eye for detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to pause it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't sneeze and be smooth about it,
but then my whole face just twitched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saved the sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to sneeze in the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can edit all that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like I'm retarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have any more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I know what I was going to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain will remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't even remember what I was
going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you got anything else you want to
throw in here or do you want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're, since I'm going to have to do
an edit breaker here anyway, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: anything rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of editing in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to ask you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I will just be quiet for half a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll throw it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, brother, man, while I've kept
you for long enough, I'm sure you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: like a two hour drive to get home from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we're getting about six inches
over the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that really what's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what my mom said before I left.
[SPEAKER_01]: She likes to check up on her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was looking earlier and it says
that we're going to get some snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's, uh, it's eight 15 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to get home till 10
15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure you got a real life?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to work tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no weekends off, but yeah,
there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice time with the kiddos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some time with the little tiny ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you coming and hanging
out, driving two hours to come hang out,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a podcast with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you inviting me up and doing
it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you need me, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you're passing through my neck of
the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're by that exit, you better message
me somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you my number right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it through Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you my phone number so you can
just straight text me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that are listening, make sure
you follow the painted chef on all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you want to stalk them on Facebook,
you could do that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just go for the, go for the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

out his kids and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at his weed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get my kids on there occasionally,
but yeah, Instagram's way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more active on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're probably going to fight over
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get on the Facebook, we don't mean
to be so passive aggressive and or
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have a lot of passion for cannabis
and we want that shit done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, um, I want to give a huge thank
you to everybody who has contributed to my
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super kind of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might not know what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a service where you can contribute
financially to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is go to patreon.com
slash grow from your heart and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a financial contribution to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get rich off of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is always going to be free
from my heart for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put out one weekly episode because
I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I love podcasting, love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be free, but if you were
able or if you would like to, or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like this podcast was worth a couple
of bucks, all you have to do is go to
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contribute as little as $1.

[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to sign up for a monthly
subscription, you will be charged on the
[SPEAKER_00]: first of every month on your credit card
of choice, and it will send $1 to my

cost of my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website costs a chunk of change to keep
alive every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where I host this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to keep it free, uh, without having to
do something, I'll like charge you guys or
[SPEAKER_00]: go find other sponsors, just asking for a
little bit of contribution through
