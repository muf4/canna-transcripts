[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dads of Sex on the
Beach live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Paradise Island and Han
Solo Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as strawberry pina
colada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I tasted pineapple and coconut
maybe in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's the pina colada part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me feel like I was on a beach on an
island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could almost feel the wind blow through
my dreadlocks as I dabbed this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the super delicious Sex on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Beach live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to do a long
rant about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about how they're made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's do some

[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take you right to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to do a rant about
making and labeling feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should say before I get into
this is this is my method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that your method,
the way you were taught, the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: learned, the way you read, the way
somebody else showed you how to do it is
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying this is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally have seen great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people who end up with my
seeds see great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people who vend my seeds are
very satisfied with me and I do not get
[SPEAKER_00]: any complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with that disclaimer, let's talk about
how I make feminized i-regenetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to cover,
something that really frustrates me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have this assumption, this idea in
their head that feminized seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not hermies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the word hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds very immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hermaphrodite or it's an intersex
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to chop the word hermaphrodite
down, just say herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermy sounds childish to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's just weird to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are true and trusted female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females that I use have been stress
tested and specially selected for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a female plant, before I even
consider breeding with it, I beat the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ways to trigger a plant
to show a hermaphroditic trait or a
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex trait if it's in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to do it is to disrupt the
light cycle during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I am working with new plants,
if I intend to breed with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put that female plant into flower
for about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeding it normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are starting to look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the plant is comfortable in
12-12, I'm going to fuck it up and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: on 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant goes, wait a minute,
it was the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's spring again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will freak the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will show signs of intersex
traits of hermaphroditism within a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will pop up little male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pop up full on pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will show you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get rid of those plants or do not
breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow those in your own
private garden, that is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not passing on that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day when you fuck up, if you get a
light leak, if something goes wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant could turn into a hermaphrodite
and that plant could explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can express that trait and that plant
could pollinate your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got very high standards for my
breeding, for my cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it shows any intersex traits,
it goes bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in it for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have problematic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line is these are solid,
tried and true tested females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ways that I abused them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said that I'll change that light
cycle to 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I may still not see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put it back on 12-12 after three
to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're three weeks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We either see some problems or we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it back on 12-12, finish out
weeks three and four on 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at week six or seven, let's just fuck
up that light cycle all again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it on 24 hours a day and see if
those plants herm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if they have any signs of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if they freak out on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants better not freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get to play with my friends
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am stress testing these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of the cultivars, the plants,
the clones, the selections that I am using
[SPEAKER_00]: have come from commercial cultivation
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all my bros and female grower
friends that work in these commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities, but many of them
are young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 24, 25, 26 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are in their early thirties.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them like to have fun on the
weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them allegedly maybe sometimes
may take a couple too many dabs on their
[SPEAKER_00]: lunch break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shit happens in the commercial
cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when shit happens, the plants get
seriously abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also sometimes equipment fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering irrigation will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see a myriad of abuse and
problems given to these plants via the
[SPEAKER_00]: grotex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody may be stoned and forget to pH a
whole batch of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody may be stoned and overwater a
whole fucking room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody may just forget to even show up
to work that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes shit happens in a commercial
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ramifications and repercussions
for the staff, but also the plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that we've got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see the plants get abused is what
I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've seen them tortured in all
sorts of ways you can and cannot imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what the plants are going to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the plants I work with,
I've seen them in a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: setting and I've gotten to watch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the commercial cultivation in Pueblo
West and the one in Springs, the one in
[SPEAKER_00]: South Denver, the one in North Glen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to go to these different facilities
and they've got the same cultivar in these
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to see it grown by four different
lead growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see it abused by four different
HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see four different bug
infestations, whatever happens in a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see it four different times in
over hundreds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen what will handle problems,
what will not handle problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is good for growing under high stress
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I've selected my females that
I'm using for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to take abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take stress very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow with good vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I think they're good plants since
they work in a commercial environment
[SPEAKER_00]: where we, I would love to say we can pay
attention to every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes shit gets overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, we got young people
who are having a good time working and the
[SPEAKER_00]: music's loud, we're going fast,
shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost train of that thought, but shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may need to fuck and press pause and
figure out where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selecting these plants from a
commercial cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're going to grow well since
the grow techs that show up late and stone
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a lot of plants to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are overloaded and bombarded
with work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can handle hundreds of these
plants, I know that when I breed to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower who is new at growing will
definitely have good success with a small
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good successful plants is what I
think I'm trying to say with the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been vetted by my self and by
several other commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're verified qualified plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not males.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the plants that I start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main most important thing I think is
starting with trusted breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make a good cake with shitty
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have champions without good
fucking champion stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm saying, but you need
good plants to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we've got two qualified
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we've got one qualified plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with one that we want
to make feminized seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kind of go through the process of
how I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selected cut is I would take two
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just want to make a small batch of
FEM seeds, I've got one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take two clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get about the size where I'm ready to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where the feminization process
kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one of the selected cuts is treated
with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a blend of silver nitrate and
sodium thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two products that are available
for purchase on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know where to look, they're not
very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're safe with them, you can cause
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you inhale them, just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the safety precautions on the
containers and you will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear a mask, wear some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably wearing a mask today
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mix up my own silver thiosulfate
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is diluted to specific dilutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is applied via a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray it directly onto the plant by
itself without a surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm applying diluted silver thiosulfate
solution onto a plant at very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: dilutions and very specific intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The strength of my solution varies based
on the plant I'm trying to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want really strong solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really freak out if you spray
them too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a lighter solution more times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of you have to learn the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I mean by intervals?
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray it at a very, very carefully
scheduled time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly which day those plants are
getting sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you how many times each plant
that I reverse will get sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've worked with it a couple of times,
excuse me, I'm choking on my own words.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've worked with a plant reversing it
several times, I've already got a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, a notebook, a recipe in my head,
somewhere I've got it written down and
[SPEAKER_00]: marked down that I know it needs this
dilution and needs to be sprayed this many
[SPEAKER_00]: times for optimal pollen production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray a plant with too hard of a
solution, too strong of a solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the plants will produce pollen
sacks, but they will not produce any
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a really pollen sacky plant,
nothing comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't use a strong enough solution,
obviously it doesn't reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to find the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want to be sprayed really hard
a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want to be sprayed really
lightly a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want to be sprayed really hard
a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the plant and what it takes
to reverse that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to learn that is by doing
it to that specific plant and watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the leaves will crinkle up and
it looks like you just shocked that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with a fucking laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone a little bit too hard,
but oftentimes those plants make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going for looks, we're going for
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about pollen production is the
main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mix up silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dilute it to specific dilutions and I
spray at specific intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I spray, I spray the shit out of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remove the plant that is going to get
sprayed out of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the only one to get sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I soak it to the point of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a puddle on the floor around the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also make sure to spray the sticks and
the main stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just focus on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a lot of silver into this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thiosulfate acts as a carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver cannot penetrate the leaf
surface and get into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thiosulfate makes it more bioavailable
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you want to say is, I don't know
if that's the correct word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it more, gives it better
penetration for the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets the silver into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver is the active ingredient that
is going to work the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've selected proper plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mixed up a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made a schedule and I've applied my
solution at the proper schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've applied to runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten silver thiosulfate into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver is into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about how and why this
feminization process works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just sprayed the plants with silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver stops the copper movement within
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is copper moving in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feed the plants lots of minerals,
lots of elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper is one of the things that is
abundant and moving within our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that abundant was the
appropriate word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is present and moving within our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I disrupt the copper movement by
spraying the silver thiosulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: that disruption triggers an ethylene
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethylene is a hormone that triggers,
and I just wrote down a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions in different species of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you research what ethylene does in
plants, it has a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: functions and triggers in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes some plants ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot to do with ripening and
senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, it makes cannabis think that
the end is near.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, I'm ripening for some reason and
I wasn't ready to ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis' main goal is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a lot of us, all it wants to do
is reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a female cannabis plant, its only
instinct is to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to make, the only way it can
reproduce, the only way it can survive is
[SPEAKER_00]: to make seeds so that next year those
seeds can grow and it can carry on its
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we freak this plant out,
it kind of panics and it goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may die.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hormones are all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scared of life right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes pollen sacks because it's
already got the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already got the female sex part so
that it can breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes pollen sacks to where now it's
got the part of the breeding that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that plant is self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say you've got pollen
sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there are no male chromosomes present
because I have selected a tried and true
[SPEAKER_00]: solid female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have proven that by my stress
testing earlier, by messing up the white
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule, by overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: By giving it too much cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk too much about stress
testing, but light is the main way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it heat, give it too much CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give it CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I withhold waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let fucking the guys at the grow grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will stress them for you and tell you
what stresses those plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not showing intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a female that has been treated
with a chemical that is now hormonally
[SPEAKER_00]: reacting by producing pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pollen sacks contain pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the magic part is there are no male
chromosomes within that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the pollen in here is female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend, Mr. Sol, made a great analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, just imagine if you put your
female plant here and your pollen donating
[SPEAKER_00]: plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's a reversed female and
we put a filter between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would only filter out male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically what we have learned to
do by creating feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no male pollen, no male
chromosomes available in this exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have created female, all female
pollen, XX pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no Ys, no males allowed,
no boys allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all girls club in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have done my selections properly and
I think my track record shows that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty damn good at selecting female
plants for feminized seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we have got female or
feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the basic beginning of making
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've taken selected plants,
made my solution, applied the solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that silver has created an ethylene,
a copper disruption, which created an
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene response, which triggered the
plants to create pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of the short condensed
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you guys to understand,
that's really all you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to read more, I encourage it
because it's really fun learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones and ethylene and pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about plants,
you'll really open up your mind to
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we have got a female
plant that is now dropping feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first half of our breeding
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember earlier I said we were going to
take two clones of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got one, it is reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we treat it with the silver
thiosulfate and it starts changing its
[SPEAKER_00]: sex, we have now reversed the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gotten a sex change,
but we just call it reversed to be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got the one reversed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the remaining clone that we have
not done anything to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is growing just like it normally
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we've bottomed it and cleaned it up
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you topped it to get more tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to do to keep that plant
growing happily and healthily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to put the plants into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of options here,
things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either collect the pollen from the
reversed plant and store it and then apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would prefer to do is just put
that plant in the room along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: females that are going to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation you need,
since I am choosing to put the male in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with the girls, I need to get him
pollinating, get him started ahead of time
[SPEAKER_00]: for the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to take a while to produce
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversed plants tend to take about 10 days
to two weeks longer to drop pollen than a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard true male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A male plant will start putting out pollen
sometimes day 10, 12, but hopefully around
[SPEAKER_00]: day 14, 17 you start getting pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around day 23 to 30 you're really
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a reversed plant I generally don't
get pollen until days 25 to 32-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a little bit later depending on
the cultivar and how well I reversed her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I'm learning it'll take a
little longer and I honestly don't get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of pollen from reversed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they are a little bit more
pricey than the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the normal male plant will pollinate
much earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reverse plant pollinates around day 26
to 35-ish, hopefully somewhere in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've got to do is we've got to
get him going and flower and starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce his pollen way before the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a trick that I usually charge
money to tell people, but I love you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you've listened to this,
this far you deserve this tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am making feminized seeds,
the way that I time it properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not put my females in the flowering
chamber until my reverse reversal has
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to solidly show me some male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got some pollen sacks and some
balls popping up and I'm certain that my
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal is working, that's when I'll move
the girls into the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you move them into there too
early, the females miss their peak
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination point and then it takes too
long for that reversal to start dumping
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get very little pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get very little pollen reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get very little seed production and it
is not worth your time and space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a commercial seed producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to time it out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I see that guy, not as soon,
but I know when I see the guy making his
[SPEAKER_00]: balls, the girl making her balls,
I know that it fucking gets confusing when
[SPEAKER_00]: you got these things going on,
but it's 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to accept this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my female starts showing her balls,
I said that, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my female plant starts showing her
balls, that's when I move my other females
[SPEAKER_00]: into the room to receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that plant's going to drop pollen onto
my girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens just like a male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can consider the pollen as the
sperm and the pistols and the ovules are
[SPEAKER_00]: the female parts, the ovaries inside of a
lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just got to get the jizz in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get the reversed pollen onto the
female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying female because there is no
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we are making feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now taken the pollen from the
reversed plant and put that pollen all
[SPEAKER_00]: over at the right time, at the appropriate
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere probably around day 18 to 23,
25 on the flowering plant is when you want
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 32 is probably around when it's way
too fucking late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it around 18, 23, 25, somewhere in
that area, depending on the cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is where we have two different
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in my example, I said,
we're going to use the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have now done is called selfing a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way I can say this for you to
remember is that plant just fucked itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It jizzed in itself and it made clones of
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't make clones, it made seeds of
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have said clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disregard the word clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made reproductions of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made offspring progeny of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We self that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of reasons why we could do
this and a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of favorite plants,
but I cannot keep every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I would like to cycle a
couple of plants out and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that I want to,
I'm not going to do it so nobody freak
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I want to get rid of the
grateful dog because I don't have space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to call two plants, bring in two
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to get rid of grateful dog,
but I'm afraid to lose it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I could do is self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take two clones, make pollen, put the
pollen on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no adulteration of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have preserved my grateful dog when I
want it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over there in a bag in the vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I got to do is grow some seeds and
find the one that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog is back in the rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got seeds for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a really good way to preserve
across and not adulterate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by adulterating it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want golden goat seeds,
but there is not a golden goat male
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's something I want to touch on
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no gorilla glue four male
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you say you've got gorilla glue four
seeds and they're regular seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue four was a clone only
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot have regular seeds of
gorilla glue four.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something else crossed into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a fem seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gg4 purely not a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat purely not a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a male of those released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody's making pure unadulterated
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can make unadulterated golden
goat feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make unadulterated grateful dog
feminized seeds and store them for
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if people want to grow that golden
goat, they've got a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity of getting the phenotype that
they see me post because I haven't added
[SPEAKER_00]: any other ingredients into the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to make seeds of it and not
feminize it, I would have to find a male
[SPEAKER_00]: of something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it is golden goat cross to
whatever not pure golden goat kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fucks it up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is called selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take one plant, reverse it,
put the pollen on a cultivar of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat to golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog to grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that's as far as blueberry
cookies to blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is another thing that we do with
feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the feminized pollen on different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I put the golden goat pollen on
lemon Jeffrey that are on the lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat pollen on a lemon skunk female
makes feminized lemon Jeffrey seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called a reversal or an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That indicates the difference between
selfing and using the pollen on another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done there is we have created a
brand new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made a new line and we didn't have
to use a male plant in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a feminized brand new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of calling it an F1 or an S1,
which is what we would call a self
[SPEAKER_00]: project, this is now an R1 to indicate to
my customers and people reading about it
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is a reversed feminized cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a male used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an R.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the S indicates selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I say S1, that's the selfed first
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say R that is the reversed first
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: R1 is a first generation reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that covers the basics of FEM
seeds really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important is selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select solid females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make your silver thiosulfate
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next important part is learning the
dilutions and application intervals and
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply your silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to time out your males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the male dump and pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the females ready to receive pollen at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everything else, if you're breeding,
if you're growing seeds, everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: happens just the same as it did with
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pollinating just like you are any
other crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make self seeds or we're
going to make reversed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason why you cannot put ...
So if I wanted to reverse golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could reverse the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a clone of golden goat in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a clone of platinum tangy in the room
and put a clone of lemon skunk in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I can make golden goat FEMs,
lemon skunk or lemon Jeffrey FEMs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also platinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Sunkissed FEMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of shit in my brain right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep it all straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can make three different lines of
FEM seeds from that one golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you see me making multiple
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red pill, the blue pill is a golden
goat feminized cross, lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum tangy, the golden goat,
there are several of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garlic goat, which was kind of rare,
that's been going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all feminized golden goat
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them happen in the same room
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to breed just golden goat to
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put multiple girls in there and make
a lot of great crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do golden goat to golden goat,
just to recap and keep it in your brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a self.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fucking itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's crass, but you're not going
to forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I pollinate anything else with that
pollen, that is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will both be feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where I'm going to reiterate,
they are not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.9% of the feminized seeds I produce are
true feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 0.1% that gives me the opportunity
for complaints and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get the complaints and fucking
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, nobody sends me emails saying I
bought FEM seeds and I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites or I've got problems
because I feel like my process first of
[SPEAKER_00]: all, I keep reiterating that selection
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that process is solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my reversal process is solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's something, the next step for a
breeder, for anybody making FEM seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: here is the next most important step for
you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not give them to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't donate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be setting people, you may be
giving them fucking dynamite for their
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have just given them a big batch
of hermaphrodite seeds of intersect seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to put them in their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be experienced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you told them feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even looking for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: First day of week three, kapow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is pollinated because you've
done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your responsibility as a breeder,
a pollen chucker, a cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: member, somebody who's trying to help,
is to grow the seeds you made yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get one hermaphrodite, one intersex
plant out of that batch of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to reconsider what you're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to put that out there to the
community?
[SPEAKER_00]: One batch of herm seeds can ruin a seed
company's reputation for the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be on top of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you release one line of herms,
you may have just ruined your seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of your career.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still sell some seeds, but people
will be very reluctant, very hesitant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will come looking at me for my FEM
seeds because I've got a better
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it done in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a breeder who was fucking killing
it for several years, putting out FEMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a lot of complaints about
problematic fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't see him at events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see his booth anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's still online selling seeds,
but he doesn't go to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to put his face out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would probably get a long line of
people yelling at him and another line of
[SPEAKER_00]: people trying to buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just stays at home and clicks on the
internet and does his sales that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility to make sure
that the seeds you created are worth the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be better or as good as the
parent plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making self seeds, make sure
they look like the fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're promising people they're going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see, this is a good way to segue
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a little bit of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not introducing another cross into
there, but Golden Goat's got parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got two grandparents on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see a little bit of variation when
it comes to your FEMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That depends on the parent plant that you
choose to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're making selfs, there will be
little variation, hopefully, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're working with the reversals,
you are going to see a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: female and a little bit of the reversal
come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get mostly 50 50s,
but you'll find a really dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype in that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't make a phenotype that is
as good or better than your starting
[SPEAKER_00]: parent stock, you did not do a successful
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have not done anything improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just fucking made a copy or you just
kind of made a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to improve cannabis to call
yourself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal, have an intention and make
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take us backward in the evolution of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please move us forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, they're not
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no, if the word herm is available
in this situation, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't breed with herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seeds are hermaphrodites,
if you get more than if you grow a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get two herms out of there,
you're getting 2% and that is beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold of allowance for hermaphroditic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've either got to cross that back
again, get a good female and then reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: your original mom and fucking redo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got like a femme fucking back
cross thing going on, which it'll work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would abandon the project all the
way because that means that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditism present in that line of
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even fuck with it or maybe at
least try a different phenotype of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a different phenotype,
you know, why are you making femmes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So abandon it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be ashamed or afraid to abandon a
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more admirable, respectable to say
this batch of seeds is shit, flush or feed
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the bunny or whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make hemp seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some seed sprout tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can make some fucking Korean
fucking natural farming sort of stuff out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, but don't sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect people to put that in their
gardens because as a breeder, we want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I think our job, our goal,
our purpose, our mission, we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: here setting people up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be making cannabis better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be making growing easier,
more enjoyable, more successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: more pleasant for our clientele,
our customers, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: them, our fucking friends, our community,
our family, the people that buy seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, keep me alive, keep me afloat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep fucking food in my belly and
Nikes on my shoes and fucking they help my
[SPEAKER_00]: kid eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a fucking daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a drum set addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dabs to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really respect and appreciate my
customers, my clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to rip off my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feel like a shit bag of a person
if I sent out a batch of seeds and anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me a message going, bro, your seeds
fucked up my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds you made hermaphrodited and
put pollen on my fucking girls and I
[SPEAKER_00]: needed medicine and now I don't have
medicine, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I would probably grow a crop for
them or buy them medicine if I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how bad I would feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking feel things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People work really hard for their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, they work hard for their
money to buy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if, even if you get them directly
from me at an event, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's several hours at your job,
slaving away, doing some shit you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do for someone you didn't want to
do it for in a condition you didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you give me that money,
I want you to have a smile, not just be
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied with the seeds you got for the
price, but you need to be satisfied with
[SPEAKER_00]: the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just fucking pouring red bull
and miracle growing your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't ask me for help or do ask me for
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fucking help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you fuck them up by doing that,
that's your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get a shitty outcome on my
fault, I feel really bad for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I made, I think that comes by in
my tone of voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see the show, you don't
definitely know I'm sincere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want people to have great success
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I do the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is free because I want everybody
out there to grow the best ganja they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to recreate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to feel good, feel iry and
feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're making seeds, make sure you
are improving on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're not making it worse
because I'm doing a lot of work and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of our friends, a lot of our cohorts will
call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colleagues may be a better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out there doing our best to make it
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to breed, please do
your best to improve on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel like that went by quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we're at about 35,
30 ish minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if I do a couple of edits in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I was clear and concise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I repeated several things,
not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Femseeds are not, my femseeds are not made
through hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a method that some people use,
old school Dutch methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of moved on from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those companies don't last.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not around any longer because they
weren't feminizing properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can trust most of the major
companies that are available now making
[SPEAKER_00]: femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of my mission here was to dispel
the myth that they're fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That frustrates me because I work hard to
make quality fems, or that they're herms,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work very hard to make quality fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I don't think that we need to be
afraid of feminized seeds anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to quit bashing people who
choose to grow femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant you grow will be a viable
plant if you get it to fruition,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it germs, you'll probably get fruits
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing reg seed, you got to cut
down probably 50 to 60, maybe 70% of your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking plants before they even get to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an area with limited plant
counts, or if you're in a small tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you really rely on every one,
if your system, if you've got a six plant
[SPEAKER_00]: setup and you need all of them,
those fems are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have an empty pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty pots are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, that pot should be
producing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have something in there,
you're running lights, you're running your
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That empty pot is costing you whatever you
would have produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feminize do have a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not fucking hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please quit saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I've got for my
feminized episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like my voice has given me the
same hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you guys for hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask about where they can
grab my feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly recommend seedsherenow.com.

checkout.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save you 10%.

cover your taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting a big order,
that will cover, that should help you out
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
