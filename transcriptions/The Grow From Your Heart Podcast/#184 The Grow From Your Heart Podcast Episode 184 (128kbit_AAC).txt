[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's

two, and three.
[SPEAKER_03]: This time we're going to do episodes four,
five, and six for those people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: been Jones and Frold episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I get into it, I do need to make a
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone 185 episodes and since I started
recording, I have learned a lot about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and a lot about growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the things I said in the earlier
episodes, my ideas and opinions may have
[SPEAKER_03]: changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't hold anything I said in the
past against me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, all of the social media has changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please ignore all of the I Grow Culture
social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: The new social media stuff, if you want to
follow me, if you want to contact me,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you want to reach me, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Twitter is at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: My personal Twitter is at Rasta Jeff 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd like to email me, send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear what you've got to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
a really long file, so I'm going to quit
[SPEAKER_03]: rambling and I am going to play episodes
four, five, and six.
[SPEAKER_03]: With what used to be the I Grow Culture
podcast, now it's the Grow From
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a really long file,
so I'm going to play episodes four,
five, and six.
[SPEAKER_03]: With what used to be the I Grow Culture
podcast, now it's the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought it'd be a good opportunity,
because I'm a business student coming in
[SPEAKER_10]: from out of state to get to recognize the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're ensconced that you've been here and
you've been part of the whole process,
[SPEAKER_10]: so it's two totally unique views.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I thought, and for our listeners,
I just didn't record because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: get what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing the 719 The Blocks podcast and
the I Grow Culture podcast at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a dual episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to record this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's getting himself a cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he'll be right here to do the intro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to record this one show and
we're going to post it on both of our
[SPEAKER_03]: feeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can listen to this at 719 The Blocks
and I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you're an I Grow Culture podcast
listener, do me a favor and go check out
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine and My Bro's podcast called 719 The
Blocks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then 100%, if you like listen to 719 The
Blocks, listen to I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only to have some sort of different
educated opinion, to combat whatever the
[SPEAKER_11]: Pueblo Chieftain says.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you, Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then two, even if you don't like growing
weed, I'm pretty sure what Jeff has to say
[SPEAKER_11]: about growing period probably applies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't even talked much about growing
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to build an audience before we
start The Grow School.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first episode was about edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a big report that the edibles
weren't containing what the dose of THC
[SPEAKER_03]: they claimed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you see who commented on that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Nick Naglich.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a photographer of the pulp.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, I got a red card.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean you're already reaching people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode two, we featured a phone interview
with Addison Demora from Steep Hill Labs
[SPEAKER_03]: discussing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the, Steep Hill Labs is the industry
leader in medical marijuana testing
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: They test your cannabis for THC,
CBD, THC, V and N.
[SPEAKER_11]: How about hot fucking coffee?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that good and hot for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: It just came out of the, you poured it out
of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: That seems great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our second episode had Addison Demora
talking about residual solvents left in
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talk a lot about just goings on in
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to dispel myths and educate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, and that's muy importante just
because it's another information source
[SPEAKER_11]: for people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you don't agree with marijuana,
there's still another information source.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't agree with the Bush presidency.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't agree with everything he said.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I watch YouTube.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot of information on
YouTube about George Bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to watch him turn into a reptile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do the little intro.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Hey guys, someone on the blocks
podcast is brought to you by
[SPEAKER_11]: iRegionXColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: Visit iRegionXColorado.com for all your
feminized, non-feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also nature's green remedies guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I logged onto that site.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of shit on that site,
man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of my friends are on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to start growing so I could
have a nickname.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really all I want.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the fucking, you know, the Arabian.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all use our, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when we go places, people are like,
what's up Irie or what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: We say, what's up to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, half my friends real names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ewok.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know his real name, but if I say
Ewok, he looks, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are like a pseudo gang culture,
but you're not a gang at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're so peaceful.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to show up to your house and
dab you out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, fuck you cloud, fuck you Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diagro Culture podcast listeners are
confused by that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tradition here on the 719 the
Blocks podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be done on every single one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get down to some business.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're crunched on time because I got to go
to Looney's open mic to fucking get
[SPEAKER_11]: registered to be a comedian.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I could be learned to be a comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's going to comedy us up tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, I am on a double end.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a great, like 24 hours of comedy
for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm trying to keep the roll going,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want to talk about what you did last
night briefly?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to see my buddy Wade perform live at
fucking ComedyWorks downtown in Denver,
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know ComedyWorks,
I have seen Ralph E.
[SPEAKER_03]: May there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Mark Marin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Josh Blue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I think we're going to go see Benson
again on the 11th.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go see Anthony Jeselnik
with me on April 27th.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but yeah, I'll go do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, like, so Ari Shaffir,
Joe Rogan, these guys, Joey Cocodillas,
[SPEAKER_11]: they read Denver ComedyWorks as one of the
top five comedy clubs in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade got to perform there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got a two minute set and he crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crushed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was the sixth one up, which it was very
shocking to me because I thought I was
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be like the second one or the
first one up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was prepping for.
[SPEAKER_11]: But being the sixth one up, that's like my
that's my bad bitch number.
[SPEAKER_11]: You had a golden spot right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my that's the number I want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big thanks to the guy that went before
you who bombed and made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made it easy for you to look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just smeared shit all over the stage.
[SPEAKER_11]: So so that poor guy did that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy who runs the thing comes up as
he's going, he's like, how do you like to
[SPEAKER_11]: follow that?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: His exact words were, are you ready for
that?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You recovered it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just came out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first thing that I did,
Gary, it freaked me the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how guys, if you don't want to
give Jeff a lot of fucking credit for
[SPEAKER_11]: sound, like a lot of credit for sound,
I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I sound distracted on the show
often.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I grab the microphone and comedy works and
I talk into it and I don't think it's on
[SPEAKER_11]: because the sound is that perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even for the listeners, it was so perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm a loud bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was glorious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Wade's a comedian to the I Grow
Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you couldn't get that one.
Wade's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to introduce these
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's so the great thing about that
whole set, or not the set, but just the
[SPEAKER_11]: set up, I should say, is that the stage,
it is so personal.
[SPEAKER_11]: That audience is right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could see about the first four to five
rows, everyone's very involved.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are right on top of you and you get
the looks of if you're bombing at all,
[SPEAKER_11]: you could see disappointment.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it wasn't it wasn't like that for me,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thankfully enough, it was a good
preparation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was being a Nazi OCD about my time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, can we take a quick time out?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a fucking guest here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I said briefly talk about your
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a guest here that's with us as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not trying to like ignore him.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I just wanted to really give you
credit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, I still want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I still want to talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You deserve credit on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of my friend, Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to make sure to say that on air.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on to Gary, actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's and for those of you on the comedy
front and I Grow Culture, check out the
[SPEAKER_11]: blocks comedy at Facebook just to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I post there as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: He does all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Gary is I don't want to say transient,
mature, new, transplants from where you
[SPEAKER_11]: from, Gary.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been in Austin, Texas last 20 years,
originally from Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_11]: What part of Louisiana?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just south of Shreveport.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Small town.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk about how we met him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you comfortable with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a local hookah bar, the cloud nine
hookah bar that once in a while will do an
[SPEAKER_03]: invite only dab party.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it a private party and they
invite us down and we go there and do dabs
[SPEAKER_03]: in the hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a couch and take some dabs with me
and I dab everybody out and they offer
[SPEAKER_03]: dabs there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Gary was sitting next to me and
noticed that I might know a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: people there and sparked a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sounded super intelligent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I introduced Wade and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, check out Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was plug Wade because Wade was on a on
one that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a cocky bastard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people would be like, that's why he's
a dick.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just looking at girls.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you were having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you came from a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were in that, you know,
that snap mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how we met Gary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else did you want to get?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Gary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: So so Gary started coming to comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he does have like a good frame of
reference of like comedy within like what
[SPEAKER_11]: we're going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: So to cut back to comedy works real quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to talk about Gary,
but we can talk about you some more.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't need to talk about comedy
works.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was a segue.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Gary, Gary approaches me at the comedy
show higher on the agriculture show than
[SPEAKER_03]: we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weed show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of coffee on my show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary comes up to me last week.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, hey, man, I'd like to get on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to talk about the state of
marijuana in Colorado, which is an
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting dynamic because Gary says he's
from Austin.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been there the past 20 years
recently.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long have you been in Pablo since
January the 8th, January the 8th,
[SPEAKER_11]: literally seven days after weed was legal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary's up in this motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're here to do what, Gary?
[SPEAKER_10]: Working on my degree at CSU and at the
same time looking to get into the
[SPEAKER_10]: marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_10]: I recently was hired as an operations
manager.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a caregiver grower who is becoming
licensed to be an offsite cultivation unit
[SPEAKER_10]: for a major dispensary out of Denver,
a major chain of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he needs logistical operations.
[SPEAKER_10]: He needs help with managing multiple
locations, multiple grows, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just the back end of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the expert grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's his expertise.
[SPEAKER_10]: He needs someone to make sure all the
materials are there on time and manage the
[SPEAKER_10]: people and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I'm in for.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you come to me, you say the state of
weed in Colorado and define this statement
[SPEAKER_11]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, gosh, we're in a significant
economic genesis here, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: With the legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just reported today the revenues were
up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Revenues were up again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Friday, Eric Holder, U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: Attorney General, announced publicly that
he wanted to work with Congress to
[SPEAKER_10]: reschedule marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you mean reschedule, Gary?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's rescheduling?
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it from where it's being treated like
heroin now to where it's treated more like
[SPEAKER_10]: nicotine or alcohol.
[SPEAKER_10]: Reclassify the caliber of drug it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think changing it is legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the current is legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think changing it is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's legalization, effectively.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's well regulated, of course,
highly taxed, of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: But just like alcohol and tobacco,
legal, obtainable.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so if that does happen, do you feel an
onslaught coming?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we feel that Colorado is going to be
under a microscope even more?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably less at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll go nationwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a lot more places to stare at.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some indication that it could be a global
thing, too, if you really follow the news.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uruguay legalized.
[SPEAKER_10]: At the time that they legalized,
which was only six, seven months ago,
[SPEAKER_10]: they were criticized by the U.N.
[SPEAKER_11]: Still are being criticized by the U.N.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the U.N.
[SPEAKER_10]: has changed its position now on drugs in
general, saying that criminalization is
[SPEAKER_10]: not effective.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was official at the beginning of the
month, that they're officially changing
[SPEAKER_10]: their position that criminalization of
drugs is detrimental to the population.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're advising against it now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do you think the government's just
trying to get a jump then on the process,
[SPEAKER_11]: the money that they're missing?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're getting the weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, if they want their sticky
fingers and sticky fingers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, another significant indicator and
just a delicious bit of irony is that the
[SPEAKER_10]: government got a jump on everybody by
patenting 1999 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I wasn't aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about it, but I didn't know what
actually happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: Department of Health holds the patent
medical patent on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: The patent number is available.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Google it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's legit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means they knew that it was
valuable and useful and medicinal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can also say that this is this
movement of legalization is probably
[SPEAKER_10]: pre-planned and orchestrated by someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at the quickness that it
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it was legal, everything just fell
right into place so quickly that I
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't doubt that one bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, OK, we're not going to fucking move on
from this now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are just throwing some fucking
assumptions out there without some
[SPEAKER_11]: details, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I say it seems like I don't have any
details, but it looks like everything fell
[SPEAKER_03]: into place perfectly from my view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you talk about the things that are
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo Springs Ranch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened like the day after they
announced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's legit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pueblo Springs Ranch was supposed to be
going up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Two thousand.
[SPEAKER_11]: And eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, there's a lot of things that seem to
have just all the businesses were booming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything went right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The troops were lined up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you talking about since January 1st or
since M.M.J.?
[SPEAKER_03]: January 1st.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: M.M.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: was a good start.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what the fight what what the fuck is
the fight for them from like city city
[SPEAKER_11]: council and shit like that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, do you feel city council for the
most part?
[SPEAKER_11]: City council is allowing this.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are being kind of shitty on the no M
.J.
[SPEAKER_11]: inside city limits.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should they should allow at least one
good dispensary within city limits because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're losing out on money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're losing on so much money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just locally here in Pueblo,
it's old blood that is voting against the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to keep downtown a historic
district and let it be so historic that
[SPEAKER_03]: they put a gym called reps in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you notice they didn't deface the
front of the building in any way?
[SPEAKER_03]: They left it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still looks like an old school building
out front.
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That trendy reps sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: The building is that's why a lot of that
stuff downtown is untouched.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are signs for buildings that there
are signs for businesses that were there
[SPEAKER_03]: way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't exist because this district
won't let you deface those signs.
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn high opinion of themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of I try to be more
diplomatic about talking shit about my
[SPEAKER_03]: public officials.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them because they do really try to
think they control everything and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't listen to what their public wants
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they've had they've had they've had
a history of such action.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you go back to the smoking ban,
this ban smoking without putting it to a
[SPEAKER_11]: public vote, then we had to make this
whole big issue out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've wasted a lot of money and a lot of
resources on a lot of godly shit,
[SPEAKER_11]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_11]: like the fucking new municipal fucking
police court or whatever the fuck that
[SPEAKER_11]: building is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't want to go inside of ever 10
million or however much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they still can't fucking pay enough
people to put inside there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just have a lot of goddamn issues.
[SPEAKER_11]: And marijuana seems to be a capable tool
of solving.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the reports, no crimes have
gone up near dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just released another report stating
that crimes have gone violent crimes have
[SPEAKER_11]: gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's depending on where you read,
because any news report just says what
[SPEAKER_03]: they want.
[SPEAKER_11]: They released a national or not a Colorado
crime report for the past 90 days,
[SPEAKER_11]: like almost basically like the first
quarter, which is a snapshot or probation
[SPEAKER_11]: period.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it basically everything was down.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were there were like I want to say
there was like 80 percent of all of the
[SPEAKER_11]: things that they thought would be shitty
were actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't realize that the weed heads are
the peaceful guys sitting on the couch
[SPEAKER_03]: chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're not all sitting on the
couch, but we're doing our daily things.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we get baked, the worst thing we're
going to do is eat everything in the
[SPEAKER_03]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's what I find hilarious is that
they're trying to find things to highlight
[SPEAKER_11]: now.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to highlight searching.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not just people's physical
reaction to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's it's anything that marijuana can do
horrible to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Gary comes from Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How how is how is the difference of
seeing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure in Texas you I have friends that
have been incarcerated in Texas just for
[SPEAKER_03]: having weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here you can carry you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're not a medical
patient in Colorado, you can possess an
[SPEAKER_03]: ounce if you're just any random Joe in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twenty one and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it feel to just have it's almost
freedom here?
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really took me a while to adjust to
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, gone to some of the clubs like
in the Springs and, you know, walk into a
[SPEAKER_10]: room with a group of people that I don't
know that are all high and getting high
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's open and it's legal and it's
free.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a completely unique experience for
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm 43 years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody has to hide their shit with
anybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Were you there when the police would like
walk into cloud nine?
[SPEAKER_11]: Were you there?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was there when the police walked in and
walked through and said hello to everyone
[SPEAKER_10]: and seemed just pleased that everybody was
there and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like polite and cordial.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the first person you see when you
walked into this hookah bar and I had my
[SPEAKER_03]: dad rig right in front of me sitting on my
oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got my torch right in front of me and the
cops came in, two cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at first, you know, you have that
natural trigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your body goes, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then in my brain, I went, oh,
wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I'm in my hometown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm not really afraid to get
arrested for weed in my hometown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went, wait, wait, you can have
all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not doing anything illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you look like you're smoking hookah
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was driving with marijuana on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they smiled at me, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: They snickered at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me like the stupid weed head.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at me like, cliché.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we expected to find.
[SPEAKER_10]: That shit makes you paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was driving home with weed on me.
[SPEAKER_11]: A cop was like right behind me the other
night and I was just like, fuck,
[SPEAKER_11]: fuck, fuck, fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was like, wait.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not doing anything fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was coming home last night from dinner
with a state trooper behind me and
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking the same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I kind of get like, huh, pull me over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you what a dab looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm able to educate them now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not afraid anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm an adult now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to present myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like- Well, that's really just
part of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: People not having the fear.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just get over your fear of it to be gay.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just people doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, respect them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes sir, no sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fucking be a dick to any cops,
but don't have any super duper authority.
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still figuring out my new phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are the cops in Texas when they find
you with weed?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instantly?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any amount of weed that's identifiable as
weed, you're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a felony or just a misdemeanor?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you've got reasonable quantity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything under four ounces is a
misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Four ounces is a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything under four ounces?
[SPEAKER_11]: Under four ounces.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a quarter pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're not going to- There's some
states where that's fucking- Think about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Texas and they're talking about the
Mexican brickweed, I would assume,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's mostly what's around Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They throw it over that fucking border.
[SPEAKER_10]: Concentrates though are, they're a felony.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having a dab would be a felony?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to take a dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a felony?
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck's the point of that though?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's concentrate.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like heroin or cocaine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my Colorado, California, Washington,
Oregon listeners, Michigan, there are
[SPEAKER_03]: other states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhode Island, I think, New Hampshire,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the states, I'm going to go off on
a tangent here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a good friend who's in Illinois
and he's like, I can't find weed anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you guys have medical
marijuana there in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, get it for me, find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did more research.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got the rules in place and there
are doctors that can recommend cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: for you, but there is not a known place
that I can find to buy medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the states that claim to have
medical marijuana are kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can basically grow your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys that are listening in these
states where you can just drive somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: down the street and get some dabs and drop
a half gram dab and choke for 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_03]: and laugh and just take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude right here would have gone to
prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look like you'd enjoy prison
much by the looks of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look like the prison type.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a lot of books or
computers in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seem to be things you'd enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: How much money does Texas?
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's like the big question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll go around the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hear us coughing, that's what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a question.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this was something maybe the
the number crunchers and the government
[SPEAKER_11]: were looking at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, green dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who we're dabbing from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a shout out since we're doing it on
the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the number crunchers and the
government wanted to see if the revenue
[SPEAKER_11]: would outdo the revenue made off of
marijuana sales would outdo the revenue
[SPEAKER_11]: made off of like DUI busts, marijuana
busts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Property seizures.
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was something they were
trying to see if they were going to do if
[SPEAKER_11]: that's something they were going to be
able to get away with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would say that's driving
legalization as much as anything because
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado it's more than double.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was reading the article.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were saying that typical year they
net about 60 million in seizures.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're projecting now based on what
the numbers they have this year's first
[SPEAKER_10]: year revenue from taxes will be 134
million.
[SPEAKER_11]: From marijuana sales?
[SPEAKER_11]: From marijuana sales.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're goddamn right, 134 million.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it's more than double.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, it's over with, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: The politicians want that money and
they're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's worth it just for the public
relations aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't think fuck the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: When weed was a crime, I used to have to
think fuck the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I can smile at them when they're
behind me and chuckle.
[SPEAKER_11]: The benefits.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the benefits of marijuana that will be
coming like hemp, growing hemp and what
[SPEAKER_11]: will come from growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like how much money can communities start
to save by having hemp products grown by
[SPEAKER_11]: the community instead of shopping at
motherfucking Walmart?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Bronner's company that makes hemp soap
has to buy hemp grown in Canada and have
[SPEAKER_03]: it shipped to America.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: To make soap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's illegal to produce hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first major hemp crops that were
produced in Colorado, guess who swooped
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Bronner's made soap out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was bought before it was
harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I wouldn't doubt that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which is how you know you're doing a
good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a crop like that before.
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we fight hypocrisy that's going on
within the state?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we often see there's the every time I
see an alcohol ad and at the same time see
[SPEAKER_11]: someone or anytime I see someone like
drink a glass of wine and then say
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana is bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit like that drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: We see bars that are polluted and I could
say polluted.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean our town is polluted with bars.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have more bars than we could ever
possibly need.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which how much collateral damage do you
think comes from a bar?
[SPEAKER_03]: One bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: DUIs, babies, fights, divorces,
deaths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've lost more than one friend from
leaving the same bar in separate
[SPEAKER_03]: occasions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're reading my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say any names on our
show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got the same issues.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a friend that took a bullet
through his left arm and it went into his
heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because he helped bouncers kick some rough
dudes out of a bar.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've worked in the bars all my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a stat that I want to know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just being a bartender.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many unwanted pregnancies am I
responsible for?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like on a Friday night?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my buddy Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who I hang out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not only that, but how many?
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's Pueblo history.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a little slice of Pueblo bar
history for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting that we come to this type
of precipice, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going because we've only got 20 more
minutes and we want to get more to Gary
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a couple of young ladies that
drove their vehicle into- I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: give them a dab so if you're a cop,
this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to go there on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to go there where you're
going.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that who you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's exactly who I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it really?
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a sensitive subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's people's kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't if you don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know that was the same one that
we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that we've lost leaving the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Carlotta Girls was exactly what I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I got like- I was just
going to leave it out of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Investigate it for that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, because I mean, they left a
bar where you were serving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I don't know if you were serving or
you're attached to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had to show like video evidence,
video evidence that was like this is what
[SPEAKER_11]: time they were here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we were responsible for.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there is only a couple of other
details.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only one detail that I will not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't give that up because it's a detail
that is public.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in that detail, that's the only thing
that basically saved me and another bar
[SPEAKER_11]: who I won't say from from getting in a lot
of trouble.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of bars in this town don't take a
lot of responsibility.
[SPEAKER_11]: At all.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can name so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud that I don't drink anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I did drink, there would be
plenty of bartenders that were ready just
[SPEAKER_03]: to over serve me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you're drunk, you tip well
and they build that relationship with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You buddy up the bartender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how we basically know each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how people know me in this town.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Wade Ridley from when I used to
manage a bowling alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
Ballin'.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to drop your mic out for a
second, Gary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cough away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a lot of noise on his mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just got him gamed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear you anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're in the recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you just dropped out, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd you go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hear you in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We dropped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to do the show by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: I found you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one tech issue every show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm fucking happy with life.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking ads and having fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And having a serious discussion at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to I Grow Culture podcast,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a new format for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to do this this one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please bear with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way different than what we normally
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to scare my friends away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you like to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get some 7-1-9 the blocks
taste while they're at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to I don't want to say
there's so much bad attached to alcohol,
[SPEAKER_11]: along with the supposed good, the mere
good, like you're drinking, you're having
[SPEAKER_11]: fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're dancing and there's Mexican music
going real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of congas, lots of short skirts.
[SPEAKER_11]: So drink Dos Equis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get in a car.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, you're talking to girls.
[SPEAKER_11]: Girls are talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, uncouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's at Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sued for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Dos Equis and car wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have that type of environment
with a marijuana culture, it seems like
[SPEAKER_11]: even in the reef of madness back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marijuana is like, I'm losing my mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we should know a pothead because you
guys are fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're lunatics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get dabbed out and rape white bitches.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now, at Rasta Jeff, but now like we're
seeing that marijuana is like helping
[SPEAKER_11]: little children, like curing little
children, little children running and
[SPEAKER_11]: gleaming and skipping.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what weed is doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be more, I want to clear that up a
little bit, because there's there needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: be some background.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are little kids that have you didn't
mention these little kids are given
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis to have cancer or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just saying there's little children
running and skipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not just getting little kids blazed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these little kids have seizures all
day long or don't eat or have a
[SPEAKER_03]: debilitating condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you give them cancer, it cures not
cures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps them deal and cope with that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: These little kids that have cancer,
they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: The medication they make makes them wither
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you feed brave Michaela a
lollipop with cannabis in it and she
[SPEAKER_03]: dances around.
[SPEAKER_03]: She may get a little bit of a buzz from
it, but you know, she's living and she
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't wither away.
[SPEAKER_03]: She feels like a child again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Show that video to my dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out Brave Michaela, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll put a tear in your eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a grown man and you'll cry from
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you do, make sure to grab some
Kleenex, call a support group and get a
[SPEAKER_11]: gal on a rocky road because it is a
journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Wade's kind of a pansy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of is an understatement when it comes
to movies.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got about if you want to leave at
the time you said, we've got about 15
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's let Gary say anything he'd like
to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put him on the spotlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Gary?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you doing, Gary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we put him on the spotlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went numb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thanks for knocking that over,
Gary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have anything to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade said earlier, he addressed us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I want to discuss the state of
weed in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've talked about how the finances and
it's going to be global.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about finances and how we see
global growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do you see coming from it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do you predict?
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you're a thinker, bro, you're a far
thinker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, like you said, you work for a guy
that grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too focused on the girl and I slip on
a lot of the things, the logistics that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're good at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are your predictions since you
seem to see a lot clearer image of what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on than I do?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: My guess is as good as anybody else's,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do follow things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do watch the news.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as part of my studies, I kind of did a
review of the media coverage on the
[SPEAKER_10]: rollout as a final project for my last
class.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do two classes every eight weeks,
like an online schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty hectic.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the last class, it was a media and
communications class.
[SPEAKER_10]: My final project was to look at the media
coverage from November 1st, 2013 to March
[SPEAKER_10]: 1st, 2014, the rollout of legalized
recreational marijuana sales in Colorado
[SPEAKER_10]: and see how the media depicted it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the principles we focused on during
this class were how the media serves to
[SPEAKER_10]: recreate the reality, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It tells you the same story over and over
so you keep believing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're looking for is the
analysis of this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm looking at three media outlets
and looking at all the stories they
[SPEAKER_10]: released during that time period and how
those stories depict the legalization of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: What bias?
[SPEAKER_10]: And the media outlets I chose were the
BBC, CNN, and Fox News.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I predicted and what my thesis was
for the whole project is I'm going to see
[SPEAKER_10]: it divided where CNN, the liberal leaning
network, is going to be more in favor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fox, the conservative leaning network,
is going to be more opposed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the BBC, as usual, is going to be more
neutral.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Was the BBC liberal?
[SPEAKER_10]: I found one negative story and it was on
CNN and it was an op-ed piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the op-ed pieces and Fox, and I went
ahead and looked at Forbes too because I
[SPEAKER_10]: wasn't believing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with Forbes.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the op-ed pieces were like some
conservative libertarian talking about why
[SPEAKER_10]: drugs should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_10]: All drugs should be legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the war on drugs isn't working.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why it's a waste of money.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing negative at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not even on Fox News?
[SPEAKER_11]: Not even that lady who said the NAACP
champions?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now I'm talking about the stories
the imprint released on their website in
[SPEAKER_10]: that time period.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not one negative story.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what they're saying on the air is a
different thing, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Nancy Grace talked a lot of shit and
it was all on the air.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was CNN too.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's CNN.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's HLN, Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that's a CNN company.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_11]: She did the subsidiaries as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's odd.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's over with, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: The journalistic reflection, the written
stories are not reflecting negatively at
[SPEAKER_10]: all.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, when you say that, that really makes
me upset.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to spend the last half of my
project explaining why I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you're talking about, one is Fox
News.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rupert Murdoch is literally like a very,
there were a version of Republican that's
[SPEAKER_11]: Rupert Murdoch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Conservative based, like Fox News
represents his will.
[SPEAKER_10]: But being a billionaire, he also has that
libertarian bent.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I'm saying is when it breaks down
all the way to local level though,
[SPEAKER_11]: when it breaks down to our level and we
open up our fuck face shitty newspaper,
[SPEAKER_11]: agro-culture does not represent the
opinions of weight in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, when we open up this fucking
newspaper, we have so many pieces still in
[SPEAKER_11]: our newspaper, our local newspaper that
say, weed is bad, weed sucks, we're dying.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the reason why it's all going
downhill.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's local, hard headed,
old school, old establishment,
[SPEAKER_10]: liquor store owners, tavern owners that
don't like that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would they?
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The same thing is going to happen with the
paper companies, the timber companies,
[SPEAKER_11]: excuse me, when hemp rolls.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's going to get bloody because
they're going to move jobs offshore.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_11]: Move jobs offshore from Colorado?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you can't cut timber here,
you're going to cut timber somewhere
[SPEAKER_10]: because that's what you do is you cut
timber.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something else I wanted to ask you
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you're working at a dispensary now
and you're helping this guy set up his
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, do you see cannabis shortages
happening in locations?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was an article yesterday that
I was reading about, it was in High Times
[SPEAKER_10]: and it was about how the black market is
still thriving in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the whole thing, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That there aren't enough recreational
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, the ones that are there have very high
prices and weed is so ubiquitous that
[SPEAKER_10]: people just get it off the street cheaper
without the tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, until you deregulate that enough that
it can compete price-wise with the street,
[SPEAKER_10]: the black market is going to remain
intact.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: The black market is completely unregulated
and untaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it have any hoops to jump through?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was driving yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up out of town and realized that
the people I was partying with,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to need more dabs than I had
available with me at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only traveled lightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I hit up Facebook and I said,
hey, I'm going to be in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a gram or two of shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any recreational shops around
that you'd recommend?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to check out a rec shop if I
had the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in plenty of legal shops or med
shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually the first person to buy rec
weed in Pueblo at the greener side.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before I could blink, there were
several posts from friends of mine saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much, fuck the dispensaries,
come to my house and I got you covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some really great shatter from two
friends and they'd rather remain nameless.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: These two grams are delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word!
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the green dot that somebody
hooked me up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys do a fucking hell of a job,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing two shows at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, shout out to Solomon who made my
little mini rigs here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little mini dad rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you did a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red, gold, and green roster rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hit like boss.
[SPEAKER_03]: That fucked me up last night after comedy
works, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if Mike Tyson walked in the
room, Wade just gave my rig the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hurt me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like when you go to hug someone and
you're like, I got to make sure this
[SPEAKER_11]: motherfucker can't fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're just kind of like,
hey, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a little flabby on the arm.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to respect the mini tubes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That fucking thing fucked my shit up
proper last night, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the next step for me?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said global.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm scared now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going to have, it's already
global, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already growing across the world
in foresty, jungle-y type places where
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be beneficial and problematic
for the industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if it's completely legalized,
let's say people are like, oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: that was all bullshit they were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fully accepted marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the next step for it?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the next step for Colorado?
[SPEAKER_11]: If we're pioneering and leading the way in
this cannabis culture, in y'all's opinion,
[SPEAKER_11]: what is the next step for not only
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_03]: One small thing I'd like to see happen is
reinstate things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've outlawed things like the ganja
gourmet.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know about the ganja gourmet-
I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to be able to go to this
restaurant and you would sit at a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bar type seating area.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a couple tables in the back area
and you could smoke cannabis in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would offer you a joint or a bar or
whatever when you walked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a little counter that was a
dispensary so you could buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just had good weed, good flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had seven or eight strains at a
decent price.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 45 or 50 and eighth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had taxes included because for shit
went weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're paying 45 or 50 and eighth and then
you'd sit down and order a meal and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything in your meal would have weed
and it would all be medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got high as giraffe pussy, Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got high as giraffe pussy in that
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even realize it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They bring you a joint before your meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You eat your meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They bring you a joint and then you eat
dessert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked that joint after my meal and
thought I should pee before dessert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get a little fresher.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the bathroom, I realized the bathroom
is melting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked out and I looked at my girlfriend
that was with me at the time and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, babe, she goes, we got to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to make the two hour trek from
Denver a little bit intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad she's a pro because she was
driving that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great, but we need to get things
like that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great because you can't do
that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can take it home, but they can't sell
it to you edible hot there and you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: consume it on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was half the fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could see half the reason for that maybe
because that's a healthy issue type of
[SPEAKER_11]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certified MMED kitchens now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do it just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the problem is then you're driving
out of there high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was high and I'm a professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke more than anybody else I hang out
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got access to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was high when I left there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me bring up this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check out Pueblo Cannabis Enthusiasts on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm building some ground support for a
private smoking club in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a partner who's working with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're at the point where we're scouting
locations.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already checked out the zoning and
stuff like that and we're moving forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to get it narrowed down what
it's going to cost at this point.
[SPEAKER_10]: We think it's viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely be interesting around here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please check us out on Facebook and I'll
keep you posted about stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_10]: I repost all the these articles that I'm
mentioning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time I read them, I repost them on
the Facebook page too.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of news there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can use a lot of news.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of funny stuff too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Patrick and George for giving
some likes and some comments on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my first ever selfie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's taking selfies you guys on the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for 719 The Blocks.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've listened to the first two.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys got some good flow, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably have Kevin over later
tonight and he'll probably record a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit with me also.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of piece this one into that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking, and maybe you can edit
this out, when Wade has to split,
[SPEAKER_10]: let me interview you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can ask you a series of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to keep recording.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll just talk for a while because
there's a lot of shit I want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We may as well record it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm dipping out though.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to dab before you go?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not sure how I'm
going to post it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may edit some of this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, hit stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to keep recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of good shit that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I hit stop, somebody says
something fucking great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep it going and we'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you guys doing the double
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate Wade for coming on the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, agriculture podcast for having me
on 100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate doing this dual combo.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary, man, that was a nice little thanks
for letting me talk over you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you have some stuff to say and
I'm glad you're going to stick around
[SPEAKER_03]: because we did.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to listen to the interview.
[SPEAKER_11]: I came to hear a lot of good shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry I got to bounce and do my job,
but that's what I gots to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hope you tear it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's been getting a lot of stage time
and he looks more less robotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks less like a game show host and
more like a comedian now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big compliment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, man?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to find the most gentle way to
tell him before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're kind of game show host,
bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: You said that in a couple of conversations
in passing though.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like knees on blood or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I don't want to hurt your
feelings and I want to be able to walk
[SPEAKER_03]: away while you deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the look on your face when
you're ready to cry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck yourself when you're ready to cry.
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, it is I'm learning to,
if anything, that competition that I
[SPEAKER_11]: didn't lose but lost.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Taught me is to control that energy like
you and Tommy kind of put that into
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't come across it as abrasive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come across as as a break to fuck people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm trying to say,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what like last night was a huge
focus for me was to not let that energy
[SPEAKER_11]: and excitement take over my body action
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every moment of your stage time last night
was precise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt it felt like you should have been
doing like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, you're one of the only
people that used a lot of the stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the more experienced guys use the
stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first few people before you stood at
the pole like here's the mic stand where
[SPEAKER_03]: the guy left it before me and that means
that's my territory.
[SPEAKER_11]: I tell you what though, the guy after me,
Deacon, that dude crushed me.
[SPEAKER_11]: That dude crushed.
[SPEAKER_11]: He killed.
[SPEAKER_11]: But he's a pro.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a he's a traveling road comic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I got as much time as him,
then maybe I would too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_11]: You give me five minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll kill like that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see you get a good ten or
fifteen up on a stage called the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: day, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they do more than two minutes or do you
increase?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next time they call me is three
minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when I prove myself at three,
I get another minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after four, I get five.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after five, I get ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comedy works the video game.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm fighting with 100 plus comics at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's it's a fucking battle,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get out of here, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace and love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a podcast with you watching
you leave all the record.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn your mic off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's taken off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to turn my chair towards Gary
and let him interview me, which feels
[SPEAKER_03]: weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to grab my dad tools so they're
closer to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, I'm ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it up tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be safe, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, call me after if you want to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's start with like.
[SPEAKER_10]: How far back do you go?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, where were you?
[SPEAKER_10]: In you know, in relation to marijuana as a
business, when it was made legal for
[SPEAKER_10]: medical use.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was made legal for medical use,
I wasn't established as a business yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took me a while to catch on as a medical
patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a street dealer when I was in high
school.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew the guys that had all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they were they kind of recruited
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm charismatic and excuse me,
I was always buying and out here and
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I was that guy that as soon
as I got into smoking weed, I didn't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy it because I smoked way too much to
buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I buy an ounce and make my quarter out
of it by giving everybody else theirs for
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how I started my
entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started shopping at a specific
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to Medamar Ministries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the first dispensary in Pueblo and
the guy that I was shopping there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were good at what they did,
but they didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say I didn't like the way they
treated the customer, but I wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew there was something lacking in
their customer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one day a customer we were all sitting
at the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is I called it the wild, wild west.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would sit in there and smoke all day
and just hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could buy another eighth and smoke that
eighth while I'm there and just hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had a day off, I'd just be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I want to say 2008, approximately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got a bad memory when it comes to
dates.
[SPEAKER_10]: But medical use is well established at
that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was well and going.
[SPEAKER_10]: But pretty unregulated as far as
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely unregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was finding friends that grow and maybe
myself that might have been growing
[SPEAKER_03]: illegally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was legal then because I had my
card now and I was bringing those pounds
[SPEAKER_03]: and quarter pounds to the dispensary and
selling those off the shelf and just
[SPEAKER_03]: selling those to my boss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would just pay cash for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it'd be like I had two jobs all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I got in good with the guys that
worked at that dispensary when I kept
[SPEAKER_03]: going there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lady asked a question and I could
tell the guy that owned the place around
[SPEAKER_03]: the place was stumped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I chimed in with my answer and I could
tell he was impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I left, he said, hey, can you come
help me transplant some plants tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I showed up early and eager
because I knew this was my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to get into the medical
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always liked customer service,
but I've always hated customer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels really good helping people that
want to be helped, but people that don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be helped.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked at guitar stores where I want
to sell you the really good shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the store won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too expensive and your budget doesn't
allow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can help you cure your ailments with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm that knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was wonderful working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was there for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually they shut down the
store is the short story.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city came in and a lawyer and a cop
and handed us a letter that said cease and
[SPEAKER_03]: desist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the end of that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: What were the grounds?
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they shut them down?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were improperly zoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was their main clause.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were right in the middle of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where everything meets is right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a joke about we should if we had
better products, we could charge more,
[SPEAKER_03]: have more business, which because I'm a
connoisseur and I wanted better product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they gave me plants and they said,
grow these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted me to grow their strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought back their clones that I
grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my boss said, well, shit, you produce
better medicine than me and giggled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I signed up people to be caregiver
for and sort of grown for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got really good at it really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started I bought seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as I bought seeds,
I saw the difference in seed figure
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to clones, because seeds where
it's at, dude, and you don't get bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I got clones from any
dispensary or anybody, I found something I
[SPEAKER_03]: wish I wouldn't have found on nearly every
clone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds, that's your fault if you get it
from a seed crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I knew I saw strains that I
liked, but I knew there was something I
[SPEAKER_03]: could get out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just started doing what any,
you know, enthusiastic cannabis grower
[SPEAKER_03]: would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started getting males and females
and put them in separate rooms together
[SPEAKER_03]: and making seeds and growing those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually I felt comfortable with the
seeds I'd produced from a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started sharing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as other people posted
pictures, I saw that I had some shit
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody else had and that there was a good
following that I had to make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it became not only profitable,
but it was I feel really good about the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds I put out.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goal was I got a Golden Goat clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my first goals was to get
Golden Goat around the world because it
[SPEAKER_03]: helps so many medicinal problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help headaches, seizures,
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really great strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Goat's got some great genetics in
there that produces great cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: that really heal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted that available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's fair that we hoard
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of, I mean, people that just
keep their clones to themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a good CBD cut, I think a
cancer patient should get one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you shouldn't keep it to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to get it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started making seeds and then it just
grew from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It snowballed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making the seeds cost money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I found a way to make the seeds
profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I made a clothing line,
which I sell more shirts and stickers and
[SPEAKER_03]: pins than I have ever sold seeds,
which I find ironic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's testament to your branding
abilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I seem to be a sort of a social media
monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to tweet and Facebook and Instagram
and that's built me up a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got 5,000 Instagram followers,
which isn't huge yet, but that's getting
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit 90% of the questions back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respond personally myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just me doing, I read genetics is
internet stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a question, some of them I have to,
I'll say refer to my forum because I do
[SPEAKER_03]: have a forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've asked a question a thousand
times, it's probably answered somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: else on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to be rude about it, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll answer some stuff that's I'm like,
Ooh, if it's an interesting question,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll definitely answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the same one I get bored with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to read your own books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple books are simple books that you
should have already for going to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And any, any books you would recommend
like, like say me, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a good example.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, the grower that I'm going to work for
his model is to take a caregiver,
[SPEAKER_10]: a new caregiver and train him to be a
grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they, um, they have a dedicated space
that they live in and they grow it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, it's a three grow commitment and
you split the proceeds of each group and
[SPEAKER_10]: he has the market already established with
his dispensaries.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, so that's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you're, you're, you know,
you're free to go and you're free to grow
[SPEAKER_10]: your own.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or go to work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, we're thinking about the
next logical step here would be,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, when we talk to the dispenser,
their biggest problem is keeping a,
[SPEAKER_10]: a competent grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know?
[SPEAKER_10]: So what if we offered you a grower as a
service?
[SPEAKER_10]: You pay us X number of dollars a month and
we provide you with a grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: all the expertise we have oversight,
you know, we have the expert guy here.
[SPEAKER_10]: If anything goes wrong, we got a guy 40
hours a week to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of guys now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, especially these larger dispensaries
that really have to produce a product on a
[SPEAKER_10]: consistent basis with limited space.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you can't afford to lose a crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your schedule's too tight.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this could ensure some continuity and
we're thinking that's a good way to maybe
[SPEAKER_10]: grow in the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, think about the impact of
that, like on, you know, the industry,
[SPEAKER_10]: it would be a significant change.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be a real shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody would be growing quality
cannabis, which would really help out with
[SPEAKER_10]: pricing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Start to come down and one more uniform
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd have a more stable career path.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a new guy, I want to ask you a
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the product vary now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what do you see while you're in
Colorado on a scale of, uh, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy shit to, oh man, what are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've seen like, you know, real
variation in pricing from recreational
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensaries to medical dispensaries to
the street, you know, huge, huge
[SPEAKER_10]: variation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a huge variation in quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: From A to Z completely from one to 10 on
the scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: So far, no source is more predictable for
quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all three justice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether I'm buying from the street and
medical dispensary or from a recreational
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensary, I'm rolling the dice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I recommend the caregiver
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been, I've been a caregiver for the
same five people for probably five years
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know them all personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sit on the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sit at this table together and talk
about what's wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's, that's really keeping to the
spirit of the caregiver model.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what the establishment I'm
working with.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way they do it too.
[SPEAKER_10]: They really want you to be an actual
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this one out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's, uh, that's GD 77 out of the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's got a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put some of that in a five minute
minute here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we get some interview going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's really, I'm pretty dabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to try to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got my throat cleared.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, it was great earlier, just about
the time it settled in, you both stopped
[SPEAKER_10]: talking and looked at me and said,
okay, speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew, I knew we did that to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw right after we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went, oh yeah, he's on the spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, yeah, it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was perfect for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I'm a big fan of the sub one
nine blocks podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been listening since I knew about it,
which is a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gone back to and listened almost all
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely appreciate that support.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I saw the announcement that you were
going to have your own podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the next announcement I saw,
I saw was for episode two.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I haven't listened yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be, it's been, it's only been about
a week or so, and it took a long time for
[SPEAKER_03]: stitcher to catch up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that they're caught up,
they'll be, they'll be up in sync.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I'm looking forward to listening
to that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you'll be episode number four is
what I think you'll be a part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three is recorded.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll post soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how did, uh, how did recreational
legalization affect your business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's kind of a seed sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do seeds is what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of my, uh, my flowers are taken up by
my patients and myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make dads out of my portion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, my patients, uh,
one guy wants half dads, half flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin wants all, all dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, another guy wants flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, I know what they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: One person I have to make topicals of food
for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like doing it, but it's well worth
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're going to take care of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, uh, my business is based in seeds
and clothing, mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the clothing, it really helped out
because now you can talk about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can wear that openly and I've got an I
heart dab sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's getting super popular
because you can heart dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you don't have to hide it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, for the seeds, most of my seeds,
I give them to somebody and he distributes
[SPEAKER_03]: them for me in his manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've seen, and that goes
internationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've seen a growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says a lot of people from Colorado are
inquiring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, if I'm, if we're face to face,
we, I can get seats to you, but I can only
[SPEAKER_03]: be so many places at one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm not in the shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not available in the recreational
shops yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're still getting the, uh,
the OPC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there are a lot of offers,
but people want my brand and they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to help me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they want to corrupt me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you were saying growers,
I'm busy growing, you know, I'm busy
[SPEAKER_03]: reading and growing and getting that OPC
going, uh, that's a, it's a challenge for
[SPEAKER_03]: a guy like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to be in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more I spend out there with the
lawyer and the accountant, I get anxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not my realm at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once I get that established,
uh, I know my sales will boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need that OPC spot and I'm figuring
it out slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to take baby steps in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to give my brand away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you can bump the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll fix all that later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn the legs.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your branding is perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: You do it very, very well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've noticed that like from the very
beginning when I first started to look
[SPEAKER_10]: your stuff up, it's like consistent.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's well done.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to keep this logo to stick in your
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, uh, everybody brags about
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I took the Colorado flag straight
off and was like, let's, uh, so I'm a
[SPEAKER_03]: Rasta man and I love Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my buddy Tony made the logo with my
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems to stick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so obviously being a, being a seller
of seeds, legalization anywhere greatly
[SPEAKER_10]: expand your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a, that's a, uh, is what I'm
seeing really.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know, you know, this is
arguable, of course, but what I see is I
[SPEAKER_10]: think that the industry is going to go one
or two ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a real chance, like especially me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone who's getting an education,
someone like you has a strong background.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you apply that in the right way?
[SPEAKER_10]: If cannabis stays illegal, like on the
state level, say they reschedule and it
[SPEAKER_10]: takes the States a few years to catch up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be better for us than if it was
like instantly legal all over the world at
[SPEAKER_10]: one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When things are illegal, profits are
absolutely higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And well, and you know, you also were able
to build like credentials and expertise
[SPEAKER_10]: and like, go through the stuff and small
scale and enlarge it slowly rather than
[SPEAKER_10]: just be doing large scale all at once.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, that's, there's a huge benefit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, find something that works and be
able to replicate it over and over again
[SPEAKER_10]: in a massive market would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you may already be there with yours.
[SPEAKER_10]: You may already have enough expertise.
[SPEAKER_10]: It really sounds like it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the capabilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, you know, like the, the other
guy's body has this vision of,
[SPEAKER_10]: of, you know, a way to like stabilize the
whole grower situation in the dispensary
[SPEAKER_10]: market, which is like a key element of
stable growth.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I see that as like a massive
opportunity as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, it makes that industry so much
more stable.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, agriculture, it's hard to get
stable.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it takes a lot of management to
get a stable production in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially a product like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why you end up with factory
farms where everything's ready and ready
[SPEAKER_10]: to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can scale that to a massive scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd take a guy like me and ask me how
many lights can you run by yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: That would pretty much be the basic
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'd say, you know, I can do 10 to
15 lights by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably do more if it were in a
facility that were easier than the area
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you had a half dozen
competent assistants, you could probably
[SPEAKER_03]: do three times that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I feel like, uh, since I've got
a smaller facility, I feel like I'm able
[SPEAKER_03]: to love each of those plants more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I had seven kids, I feel like that
seventh kid, I'm not going to give too
[SPEAKER_03]: much of a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've got one and I love the hell
out of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there were three of them,
I'd probably want to slap each one of them
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I feel like that happens with your
plants too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you hit that, uh, that struggle time,
like there's a point when it's work that
[SPEAKER_03]: you love, but I felt like, oh shit before,
like I'm never going to get through this
[SPEAKER_03]: trim job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to call a couple more friends over
or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once that gets overwhelming, it becomes
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like the plants will suffer
from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my plants, no, I love them because I
get to hug each one and tell them and I
[SPEAKER_03]: sing to them and I'm a weirdo in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, and you know, that's what makes
the difference, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that personal attention that,
you know, the more, the more detailed you
[SPEAKER_10]: can be with everything, the better off you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just a time thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't be that detailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't that good when I first started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's also a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: See that's the, and that's the real key
here too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, that's what I feel like I
need time to build more experience in the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm confident about my skills,
but I need experience in the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I have more time to do that,
then I think I'll be able to go a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: further as things scale larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I missed all of the industry stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was busy, uh, branding and, uh,
creating seeds and strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that you have.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the best is yet to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the wolves are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a couple of offers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been money thrown on my face,
but it all feels all those guys feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: they're trying to, I want to take irie
genetics and do this with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand that that's my baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, it's gotta be golden for me to
jump on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand that my brand is
worth way more than money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been living as a poor white guy for
35 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it for 35 more.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's, you gotta have that,
you know, there's, there aren't those out
[SPEAKER_10]: there that are willing to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, you know, that's another key
element is that there has to be a real
[SPEAKER_10]: diehard, you know, go to Austin,
Texas.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a Texas chili parlor where they
make real fucking Texas chili every
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking day, 365 days a year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, you know, there has to be that root
that binds it all together.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if, like I said, you get rid of that,
it all becomes McDonald's
[SPEAKER_10]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I'm afraid of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid it's going to become a weed
mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people will be okay with it
because we're just happy to have cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: and they haven't seen top shelf cannabis,
you know, excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a whole eight for $7.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you see the cheap beer sells like a
boss.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the most, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, the only way to combat that
too is to grow, you know, be as big as you
[SPEAKER_10]: can be and still keep what you do,
what you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's, you know, it's difficult at
times for somebody like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're not going to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The making dab safely.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the big threats to the
concentrates industry is the danger of
[SPEAKER_10]: making dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really hope people take that stuff to
heart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people, I still read
about, about one every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody blowing something up,
trying to make dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some house burning down in the suburbs or
garage getting gutted.
[SPEAKER_03]: An apartment or a hotel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't do that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes us all look bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've taken far steps and you knock us
down a little bit every time you do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty awful stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And people get hurt.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we don't want anybody to get
hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the blasters and the innocent
people in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always seem to be the ones to get the
most hurt.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's terrible stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's along the lines of drinking and
driving and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our version.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the cannabis world, the version of
a DUI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's not pretend like so many do that
there's absolutely no danger that
[SPEAKER_10]: everything associated with marijuana is
rosy and perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we don't have to pretend that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you have to be responsible with
your shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody does.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're high, keep your shit together
and don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've got to grow, keep it out of
the kids area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's none of my business to do with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your kid with your kids?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, like, if you got an outdoor
grow, don't keep it where the elementary
[SPEAKER_03]: school kids are going to walk by and steal
some buds off of it and take them to
[SPEAKER_03]: school and get the whole cop thing going
on because that looks bad on everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please follow the law as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to help everybody if you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Including you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop dabbing in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will if you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least pull over and park somewhere if
you're going to dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least don't do it on the highway when
you're driving with your knee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it this weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Denver, saw somebody dropping a
dab driving with their knee sloppily.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's going to come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the interstate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you closed your notebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend, are you out of out of interview
material?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I had a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to stop you.
[SPEAKER_10]: The most important question, you know,
the one you asked me where do you think?
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you see?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of corporate stuff coming up,
like the the weed mark that we
[SPEAKER_03]: hypothetically talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that kind of thing coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once people forgot that we can vote on
shit, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we remind people that we can vote
on things, there will be moratoriums
[SPEAKER_03]: lifted and dispensaries will put in
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once money comes to show politicians,
here's my whatever check for however much
[SPEAKER_03]: here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we build?
[SPEAKER_03]: People will say yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do fear a lot of a lot of
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Corporate stuff really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try not to shop at the stores,
so that stuff really intimidates me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see it could be a decline in
products and quality or it could really
[SPEAKER_03]: increase the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: River Rock is my largest example that I
know of that produces quality cannabis on
[SPEAKER_03]: a large scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have killer products now,
but it took them a couple of years to get
[SPEAKER_03]: to where I would say that they've got a
competitive product that's it's top shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their top shelf is top shelf and they
produce more than any other dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct me if I am at agriculture on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please inform me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, something that that touches on
for me is that, you know, I'm all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, really high volume solutions
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, do things well, do things
properly, organically, see the like the
[SPEAKER_03]: tomato farm model coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so right alongside the highway.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks just like high density
hydroponics, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I could I can kind of see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I fear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because I grow from my heart and
that's no there's no heart in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of what heals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's just that's if you talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the where's the?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the balance between the two?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because demand is going to dictate
production, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all know what the demand is.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if doing it with all your heart and all
your soul doesn't produce enough,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're going to get the opportunity to
make it McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plenty of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got to face that reality.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a tough.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a really tough question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to see it go corporatized
either.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to see this money, this revenue
remain in the hands of the people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, everything else is flowing to the
top.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, look at the statistics,
like 80% of profits go to the 1%.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, we divide the rest.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something if we, you know,
maybe the answer is I was reading
[SPEAKER_10]: something about this co-op model where
small operations, boutique operations band
[SPEAKER_10]: together where they say put 10%
[SPEAKER_10]: of money that everybody owns part of.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we all own a little piece of each
other's business, no matter how different
[SPEAKER_10]: they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we use that unity to fight off,
you know, RJ Reynolds, who is a giant
[SPEAKER_10]: corporation, you know, individually.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're small businesses together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of see that in the, if you're in
the scene, you kind of see that with the
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, like on my scale, we're kind of,
we're trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see that as, you know, that unity as a
real potential way of making that,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, expansion that can meet the
demand
[SPEAKER_10]: about the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep us in the grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the, you know, the patient,
you know, like it is, it is medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, for me, marijuana has always
been a sacred thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, even when I didn't view it as
medicine, it was something that did
[SPEAKER_10]: something for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From day one, day one, I knew the first
time I smelled it before I was even old
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to enjoy smoking or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I want to try that when I'm
old enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, you know, it was, it was very,
it's always been a very healing thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've seen in my mind, I've seen those
big farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about big greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I've been in gigantic greenhouses,
uh, forever flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are great greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you could drive cars into those
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could drive your tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Into there and dig your holes out for your
12 foot tall plants and those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that, that is the future of cannabis
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there are some States that are going
to try to try to go really slowly,
[SPEAKER_03]: but are we going to buy up all of our
vacant land?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our land that's semi-flat and able
to get water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we just going to plant weed everywhere
in America now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I think the people just need to learn
to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your idea of having a caregiver
teach people, give you three months here,
[SPEAKER_03]: your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or three crops of your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get you going.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you in grown out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've helped us grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you have that, you know,
you have that expertise.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go grow for somebody.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can be a caregiver and grow your own
and take care of people or you can teach
[SPEAKER_10]: other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, I've, I should have charged $1
per hour and I'd be a millionaire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of, that's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I've got, uh, I don't,
I like stutter and stop talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, I'm not super good at a mic,
but I feel like I know enough towards
[SPEAKER_03]: worth listening to where I can,
I can get you through your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you deal with me for enough episodes,
we'll get comfortable together.
[SPEAKER_10]: When that teaching stuff is, is that's
where you know, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really, really, really no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a drum teacher for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to teach, I teach music.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to teach 13 year old boys how to
play drums.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: People who value what they do teach them,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't see anybody teaching how they
make burgers at McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's teach them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a great, that's a huge
compliment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that as a compliment.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been teaching for free.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you're doing it from your heart.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's even more, you know,
it just reflects the pride you have in the
[SPEAKER_10]: craft that you're teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to honor the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, we have to give it a lot of
respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel when I see somebody's garden
that I know, I'm just like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you poor baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like seeing abused monkeys at the
zoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I know these monkeys should be
fatter.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to see it commoditized and
we have to combat that and you have to be
[SPEAKER_10]: thinking, you know, and I hope that,
you know, your listeners and you yourself,
[SPEAKER_10]: we'll just spread that thought among,
you know, people in the community that we
[SPEAKER_10]: need to be thinking about how we're going
to keep out the corporatization,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, how we can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not easy and it's not going to
be, but we can resist at least,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even sometimes I have to rely on the
dispensaries and the corporations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't make good edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes I'll be in a pinch.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to a comedy show,
I love to eat a nice edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll stop at a shop, you know,
buy a $12 edible.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there goes my money into my money that
I grow from my heart into that corporate
[SPEAKER_03]: machine.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get edibles every time I go.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm forced to go to a, what do you like
to eat?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the, I like the little sweets,
like the cookie type things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just, you don't have a favorite brand
that you go to or anything?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just looked for the cookie about a
hundred milligrams or more.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did get some, uh, they were like lemon
drops.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they were green apple and they were
like 10 milligrams each.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really liked those.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that sounds like it might've been some
mile high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those, I think those were pretty sure they
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read about those on another episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were just amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, that's something else,
you know, the edibles is a whole different
[SPEAKER_10]: aspect of cannabis consumption that I
haven't even began to touch.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's something that I'm like
just as in the dark about as anybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole new ball game.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high, the dosing, everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm somewhat familiar with the licensing
just because I researched all the
[SPEAKER_10]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the kitchen stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never paid any attention to that
because I have no desire to do a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a cook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's probably why there is no place
that serves cannabis-based foods because
[SPEAKER_10]: those regulations are several pages of the
standards of the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've never even looked into that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I operate that on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to shave my head just to walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know for sure, but I feel like
they're going to be like one of those burn
[SPEAKER_10]: unit gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you imagine my chef hat full of
dreads?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got dreads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm six foot five folks and I got dreads
past my ass, almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I shouldn't be in a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not good for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fire hazard myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, you know, the message I want to
get out there is we got to push for some
[SPEAKER_10]: of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: The smoking here in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please look at the Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pueblo Cannabis Enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo Cannabis Enthusiasts on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of information coming out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually looking for real estate
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to be zoned to R6.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't know the zone, we know of an
available building.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just send us a message.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd be glad to check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we were kind of looking at some
property in like Southlake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a depressed area.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of vacant stuff there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've gentrified that neighbor or they
are in the process, it appears,
[SPEAKER_03]: of gentrifying that whole neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks nice down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: That used to be a sketchy part of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are cleaning it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think any of the neighbors down
there would complain about us being there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a halfway house kind of near
Nevada-ish and Lake.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking further down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're far in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be close to the greener side
out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Capture some of that out of town traffic.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a restaurant down there that's
vacant that I'm trying to inquire.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're thinking that or there's a bar down
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't get excited yet, people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any leads on property would be great.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we like that area, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get that highway traffic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd catch me down there, guys,
dabbing out once in a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a great endorsement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to be able to go smoke somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to get out and get social.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't do the bar thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the drunk people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I avoid the bars.
[SPEAKER_10]: The party we attended there, the one we
met, that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: There were a lot of great people there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Met a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's really friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had two people on the show that we
met at that place that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam Gaskins came on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been going to the Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: The club's there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I enjoy going to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can say the name of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the Lazy Lion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lazy Lion and Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, those are separate places.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're right down the street from
each other on Bees U.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the 2500 block of Bees U.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really easy to find.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ample parking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to the Weed Pimps.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're associated with the Speakeasy down
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll tag them there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should distribute those too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them even if they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are good guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We support each other in our own ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: So check those guys out if you're ever in
the Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've always had a good time going to
either of those places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time I'm driving through,
I always go to Denver often on the way
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that'd be perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Lazy Lion is good for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have nice restrooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have loungers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's all Rastafied from the photos
I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's all red, gold, and green in
there, I'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a lot of good music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just got a fat plug from us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they really did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of them did.
[SPEAKER_03]: See at the VIP booth, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, those are legitimate plugs though.
[SPEAKER_10]: We like those kind of plugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, you got to support the good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you get your spot open, will it be a
bring-your-own-dab kind of place or will
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys supply the dabs?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably bring-your-own-dab kind of place.
[SPEAKER_10]: We may do some events a couple times a
month where you pay like a flat $20 to get
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fun party.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a balance between the two.
[SPEAKER_10]: An everyday place to come and smoke and
occasionally we'll have a little blowout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any sort of crow competitions or grow-offs
or anything like that there?
[SPEAKER_10]: I might associate myself with ivory
genetics and let them sponsor that kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff because they have the expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: And anybody else who has a MMJ-related
business or RMJ-related business who wants
[SPEAKER_10]: to associate themselves and help promote
us through your network, we're really open
[SPEAKER_10]: to anything we can do there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just contact us through the Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be glad to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: One person who owns a building here in
town is contacting me through the Facebook
[SPEAKER_10]: page saying that they own this building,
they wouldn't mind it being used.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's nothing wrong with it really
except it just needs a full build-out of
[SPEAKER_10]: dental studs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's in our budget for
starting off.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking for something more
move-in-ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor is cheap here, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor is cheap in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need some volunteers out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to get volunteers, but it's
cheap.
[SPEAKER_10]: A full build-out looks like it might be
out of reach.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are lots of vacant buildings in this
town, some that are very suitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there are a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But fortunately for yourself, there are a
lot of vacant buildings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we transition in this town?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen this town like this in a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took off and we got really soaring and
then suddenly we just started to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: get empty-ish in some spots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm thinking that I lived in Austin
20 years and when I moved to Austin,
[SPEAKER_10]: the vibe was a lot like it is here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just really feels like this place is
about to pop.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really trying.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of you out there in the MMJ,
RMJ business, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody who's smart or knows logistics,
operations, I'm open to working with other
[SPEAKER_10]: companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: My current gig is not a full-time gig.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm only with them about five hours a week
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, that will grow as things go,
but I'm also open to other opportunities.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just talk to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also open to volunteering,
helping people out for free.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a business, you don't know
where it's going, you really believe,
[SPEAKER_10]: like Rasta Jeff here believes,
I'll give you some free advice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll introduce you to people I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's anything I can do for you,
I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just from the short time we spoke at the
hookah lounge that night, I could tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: knew what you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's half the way I ended up letting you
come on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this guy's got some shit to
say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's really weird because I'm in
that weird transition.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been going to school.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm older.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a career in sales.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a mid-grade salesman.
[SPEAKER_10]: I made a good living.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was just fine with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I got divorced and wanted to change
my life.
[SPEAKER_10]: I decided to go back to school,
maybe reach my full potential.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very confident in my skills.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just would like to meet people who value
those skills and who can benefit from
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I prefer those people to be people who
believe in the things that I believe in,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Jeff does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things work so much better when we believe
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your nobody wants to teach anybody
how to make burgers because nobody cares
[SPEAKER_03]: about their burger job.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sums it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to do things I care about.
[SPEAKER_10]: I sold cars for over five years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cars.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want some of my soul back.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to do things that matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a full episode on the Blocks
podcast about a car dealer, one specific
[SPEAKER_03]: salesman.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been at least part of that guy for a
while.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a good guy and I'm looking to make a
contribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing what kind of mark
you make.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll definitely be in business together.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least we'll be bros through the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a fan of you guys, so it's been a real
honor to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like having fans and people that we just
relate to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason I wanted to be on the show is
that I find myself responding to the
[SPEAKER_10]: things you guys are saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk back to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Rogan will say something and I'll
respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like an idiot in the car.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got anything you want to end up with?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably put a little tag at the
front beginning of this, but guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: check out I Grow Culture.

off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tweet me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me my voice sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me my voice sounds like crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me the show is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me it's bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want both types of feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hit stop right after you say
that last thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like you got Pueblo Cannabis
Enthusiasts on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was episode number four of the I Grow
Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also 719 The Block Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you liked what you heard there at the
beginning, make sure you go subscribe to
[SPEAKER_03]: 719 The Block Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade and I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a huge thank you to Wade
for sharing the show with me and doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: dual episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to thank Gary for coming and
recording for about two hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you find 719 The Block Podcast

[SPEAKER_03]: I got Kevin coming back and we're going to
talk about crime is down in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_03]: revenues are up in Colorado with the
recent recreational marijuana law changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to leave you with some John
Brown's Body.
[SPEAKER_03]: The song is called A Little Bit of Dub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next time, take a fat dad and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Hump Day podcast world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the I Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rasta Jeff hanging out with my buddy
Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: What up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing like a couple of white dudes with
a microphone.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just sound the best.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're glad you're listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a little bit of fun today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking out some dabs from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That rhymes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be fucking rock stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be rock stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to drop this music out and we'll
do a little talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking some dabs of some Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dabbing it out of a little mini tube
that my buddy Solomon made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, great work, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the little Rasta mini tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for pictures of that one on Instagram
and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted pictures already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to episode number five of the I
Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming back after an odd episode
number four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you guys who listened to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am on another podcast called 719 The
Blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a little combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some true fan action right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to do Kill Two Birds with One
Stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a guest show up that wanted to talk
about cannabis a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured we could share that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he interviewed me at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't listen to the whole thing,
I got interviewed at the end of that and I
[SPEAKER_03]: played it on both podcast feeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, number five.

[SPEAKER_03]: If you're wondering, that was called
Unknown Number from an artist called Busy
[SPEAKER_03]: Signal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dig that tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my personal favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just opened the show with Nice Up You
Medi from Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really dig those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a lot of good reggae, a lot of
weed songs.

[SPEAKER_03]: It was strange for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're sitting here with Kevin and we're
talking about some stuff today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev just got off work, came over,
take a couple dabs and bullshit,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I brought up a sore subject,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ultimate Warrior is gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing up as a kid, bro, I remember
watching all the wrestling and I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: love anybody more than the Ultimate
Warrior.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd grab the ropes, shake the shit out
of him, and then the fireworks would go
[SPEAKER_03]: off behind him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are many great wrestlers and at
times I had switched my favorites,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I would have to say if you told me to
pick one from forever, the Ultimate
[SPEAKER_14]: Warrior would be the top of my list.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top dog, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The UW.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his face paint was stolen by the
Wu-Tang Clan and they made their little
[SPEAKER_03]: Wu-Tang logo out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm high.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite battle with the
Ultimate Warrior that you remember?
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd have to be Hulk Hogan.
[SPEAKER_14]: Me too, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_14]: WrestleMania is the most memorable
wrestling event every year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't he push up Earthquake one time?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did he lift Earthquake?
[SPEAKER_14]: That was another memorable moment for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: His charisma and his persona was unmatched
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say the only person that has a
comparable persona to that, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_14]: is The Undertaker.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not as energetic, but the intensity
of it is entirely there.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of fallen out of wrestling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't watched him in quite a while,
but when I saw on Facebook that he killed
[SPEAKER_03]: himself, did he kill himself?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I read.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: No?
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he had a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to Google that right quick,
but once I saw that he was gone,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to found, right here,
WWE.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says Ultimate Warrior found dead at 54.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize if I jumped the gun and said
he killed himself because I read that on
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook and I don't trust Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Days after, oh, this website is playing
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I muted it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Days after his induction into the WWE Hall
of Fame, and I feel weird saying WWE.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was another letter back in the day.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: He just got inducted right before
WrestleMania on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_14]: On Saturday, he was inducted.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was inducted into the Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cause of death was not released,
so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to speculate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize that I said the dude killed
himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of rude for me to jump the
gun, but I saw that on Facebook and I
[SPEAKER_03]: stupidly took that to heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ultimate Warrior is gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, we'll miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when wrestling changed was when
he kind of, I don't want to say fizzled,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when he disappeared from the scene,
when he fizzled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrestling really changed right then.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I would have known more about the
politics of what was going on in the
[SPEAKER_03]: background then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, big up, Ultimate Warrior.
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shaking the ropes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see me do it when I'm standing
here shaking the ropes and I'm doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: gorilla press.
[SPEAKER_14]: I should be wearing some ribbons.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some armbands.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some armbands or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those things made his arms look huge.
[SPEAKER_14]: They made his arms look bigger than they
were.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to take a dab, bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, let's take a dab for the Warrior.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want the domeless or the domed?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got two little mini rigs sitting on the
table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take the domeless, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's domeless?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Domeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually like the way that guy hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I prefer the way the other one hits,
but I think that one looks better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they both win.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this one hits great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was out of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Denver and I stupidly did not
take enough concentrates with me and ended
[SPEAKER_03]: up getting really like, you know,
when you're out of town, you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, this is not enough dabs to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to have twice that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I posted on Facebook, I need some dabs
and big shout outs to the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: helped me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some super quality dabs from some
friends, old and new.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on to the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, right on to the guys
that let me sit on their couch and take a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple dabs after a show late last night
in Denver before I had to drive home.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to use their D-nail.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on for letting Ron's Jeff sit on
your couch and take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always makes for a better ride home,
you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to leave what you're doing
in Denver and then head right home.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just feel rushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to go kick it for a minute
and those guys were totally cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always have to show love to badass
people like that because you never know
[SPEAKER_14]: when I'm going to need some badass folk
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like to go make new friends all
over, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized I have something called a FOMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Fear of Missing Out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to miss anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard to ... That's part of the reason
I spend money I shouldn't spend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go places that I really didn't have time
to go and I don't want to get places I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: You notice I never leave the parties where
we go dab out at the hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always plan to leave early.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, never do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's part of the reason I can't really go
out so much because I end up at places way
[SPEAKER_14]: too late.
[SPEAKER_14]: That just doesn't work out some of the
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like a worm dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the time you have shit to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I don't got shit to do for a minute
after that dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a podcast, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can handle that dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was ... I think that's Casey Jones
made by some friends of mine in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super kind folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hit this green dot here
again in a minute because that stuff's
[SPEAKER_03]: tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse my cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do like to at least try to bring a
little bit of information when we do a
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to just ramble into your
ears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Search the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a big shout out to the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know it, but I find a lot of
great news on there and I just share it
[SPEAKER_03]: with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I have a friend named Kevin who works
with Pink House.
[SPEAKER_03]: He shares a lot of info with me,
so I filter through those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Kevin and I sit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another dude named Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev Bro sit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and I sit here and we talk about what
we should discuss.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a lot of cool insights and a lot
of good points he wants shared,
[SPEAKER_03]: so he'll get some contributions going
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: After three months with legal marijuana,
Denver has not turned into an urban
[SPEAKER_03]: wasteland.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Radley Balko.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cool fucking name, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad Balko.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty neat, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He writes for the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where this article comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he rode skateboards on his.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he still skates on his.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he never gives it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for letting me fuck with you,
Rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could tag that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Radley.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd just be writing your fucking name
on the wall, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't tag that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of graffiti artist are you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone else could tag that and frame him.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's just fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give anyone that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had legal marijuana for three
months and this report says after three
[SPEAKER_03]: months with legal marijuana, Denver has
not turned into an urban wasteland.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, as Vox reported this week,
Denver crimes in the first two months of
[SPEAKER_03]: 2014 is down across the board from the
first two months of 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's still early, but the numbers so
far don't suggest that Denver is about to
[SPEAKER_03]: succumb to a crime wave fueled by
pot-addicted hooligans, as some law
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement officials warned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Us pot-addicted hooligans haven't ravaged
the town yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're holding onto your shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we've just always had a problem
with stoners, just ravaging town.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pairing up shit.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Stealing everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Killing people and we just fucking
destroy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Destroy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, and another thing, it's like,
do they think we weren't smoking pot
[SPEAKER_03]: before it was legal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had to be- Didn't have a record of
how much was being purchased.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had to commit a crime to go buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purchase it was fucking the crime we were
committing then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we are good law-abiding citizens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We mentioned on the last podcast,
if you guys didn't mention or listen,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things they were worried about,
they make money confiscating land and
[SPEAKER_03]: vehicles and money by doing weed raids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were concerned they were going to
lose that revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have surpassed that by pot sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not worried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh yeah, we're going to make plenty
of money to make up for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have your fucking confiscated
vehicles and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can't be the next paragraph to the
same story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says a 25 year old is shot dead trying
to sell marijuana the old fashioned
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two men from Texas set up a warehouse to
grow more than they would ever need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And three people buying pot in a grocery
store parking lot are robbed at gunpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: While no one expected the state's first in
the nation, recreational sales would
[SPEAKER_03]: eliminate the need for dangerous
underground sales overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: The violence has raised concerns among
police, prosecutors, and pot advocates
[SPEAKER_03]: that the black market for marijuana is
alive and well in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed, the black market is alive and well
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the beautiful rainbowy market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not black dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ridiculously overpriced.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not under trimmed, under cured,
under purged.
[SPEAKER_03]: The black market is beautiful because they
don't have to rush anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to mass produce anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we can try to figure out a way to
get the quality of the black market to the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries and shops one of these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and also the pricing keeps people
from wanting to go to the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're nodding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev's nodding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin agrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have to pay taxes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can sit on the couch while you're
there and blaze a bowl and you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: to stand in line and wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people don't like that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just want to go fucking buy
some weed and leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, those people are going to the
stores and I feel that there's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, and that's why the black market will
exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the option for both still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the older cats we know will not go
into dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, they're afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're paranoid by it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all afraid of that list.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be on some list,
man, is what we hear from a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: older cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my response used to be,
so you just want to get arrested for
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you just get on that list,
that list says you can carry pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I did that thing my grandma
used to say, which is I digress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never said that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it sounds funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: The article continues with scary stories
from Denver and its suburbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait, crime is down in Denver,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why the AP has only anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One paragraph is the closest the article
comes to attempting to find actual
[SPEAKER_03]: figures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to measure whether there
has been an increase in pot related crimes
[SPEAKER_03]: beyond anecdotal reports because no one
either side, the federal or state level is
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping track of numbers of killings,
robberies, and other crimes linked
[SPEAKER_03]: directly to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we had any major marijuana murders
lately?
[SPEAKER_03]: Has there been, have there been any
unsolved weed murders?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'll admit there have been a few
break-ins and small residual crimes
[SPEAKER_03]: resulting, but nothing shit happens no
matter what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with the population.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing a 7-Eleven doesn't deal with.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Less than what a 7-Eleven would deal with
because at a 7-Eleven you usually find a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of homeless dudes out front looking
for cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that one weird guy that seems to
be leaning up against the pay phone every
[SPEAKER_03]: 7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's more riff-raff than you see
the dispensaries don't allow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They rush you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't hang out here homeless guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look like you're bad for business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I scroll down?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So violent property crimes are down in
Denver and we have no way of knowing how
[SPEAKER_03]: many of the crimes have been committed
related to legalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet the AP, the Associated Press goes
ahead and quotes law enforcement officials
[SPEAKER_03]: who say the entire region is erupting into
chaos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see much chaos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most chaos I saw was inside the comedy
show and it was hilarious, but the same
[SPEAKER_03]: people who predicted as much before
legalization took effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so of course have an interest in
seeing it come to pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people predicted that we were going
to fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they want to see us fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to be right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're haters.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to be right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some 3 million people in the
Denver metropolitan area.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them are trying to park in the same
parking spot last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was there last night to have
some fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be some crime, whether pot is
legal or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there will be crimes that in some way
involve pot, whether pot is legal or not,
[SPEAKER_03]: just as there are crimes related to
alcohol, money, sex, and charity hockey
[SPEAKER_03]: games.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they pick charity hockey games?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it's just random.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to pick something obscure and
charity hockey games was what the editor
[SPEAKER_03]: let them run with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just as many crimes related to the
liquor stores and money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Money's got plenty of crime attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The banking systems, sex, prostitution has
plenty of money attached to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they go on to say it's also certainly
possible that the high tax on pot in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado has enabled black markets to
continue and exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I was hinting at
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: That 25% tax makes street weed is cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know the right people, if you're
hooked up and if you've been here for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while, you probably know where there's a
$30 eighth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can probably find $175 ounce if you
shopped around.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't care too much about quality,
you can find $150 ounce around here from
[SPEAKER_03]: one of your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you buy that same $150 ounce,
which that's not going to happen at a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, some of the medical places sometimes
you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that doesn't count for what I'm
getting at because I'm just headed for
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the rec shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to pay 200 at least closer to
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've seen them go for 450 in the rec
shops.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, like 450 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're paying almost a hundred bucks
tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's $400, you're paying a hundred
bucks tax.
[SPEAKER_14]: Close to a hundred bucks tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_14]: 17.4% at the point of sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that's a lot of taxes, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exactly the black market will
continue to exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy says, I oppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also at least possible that pot is
fueling crime that were it not for
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization, both violent and property
crime would have fallen even more.
[SPEAKER_12]: How so?
[SPEAKER_03]: What, if somebody can tweet me how
legalized marijuana contributes to crime,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like street crime, there's legalized
cannabis, how it's causing, how it would
[SPEAKER_03]: contribute, how it would prevent crime
rates from going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause maybe I'm missing something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to have an open mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really have much of input on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I, I would say the same point you
have.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have some kind of evidence that can
show me that go ahead and yeah,
[SPEAKER_14]: drop a line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost I would say 90% of the people we
hang out with their cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say probably a hundred percent of the
people I hang out with are dudes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I'm not even.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point I think they've all gotten
stoned with us at, you know, all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: friends puffed down once in a while with
us and at least we aren't bad people,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not criminals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that this is not illegal,
we aren't committing any crimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us are totally legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't see how they're coming up
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this article agrees with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's this article is kind of saying the
same thing as us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, where is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, but that's all speculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no evidence that any of those
things are happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we have are some anecdotes from law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps journalists should hold off on
the panicky stories and potfield crime
[SPEAKER_03]: waves, especially since the early data
showed that crime has actually dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: So crimes going down, you guys legalize
cannabis and crime drops.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're just saying shit and the data
actually says that it dropped.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the law enforcement and people are
just saying things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that reminds me of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying things.
[SPEAKER_03]: White girlfriend who's fucking wasted.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, damn, you're drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, I'm not drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the same kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they think we're going to just go,
oh yeah, you're not drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like, no, bitch, you're drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while all the, all the while we're
lowering crime, Colorado rakes in,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say raising revenue,
Colorado marijuana tax revenues total $3.2
[SPEAKER_03]: million in February.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taxes, tax revenues from Colorado's
medical and recreational marijuana sales
[SPEAKER_03]: in February increased from the previous
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to figures released Wednesday by
the state, Colorado collected $3.2 million
[SPEAKER_03]: in February below the state's projection
of 3.7 million, but slightly above the 2.9
[SPEAKER_03]: million it gathered in January.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's partly because I bet some of the
out-of-staters that did come and buy weed,
[SPEAKER_14]: they actually went home and told their
friends, yeah, you can actually go buy
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard stories of, I've got plenty of
you friends at work and dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: but one guy will show up and be like,
I'm from Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, just all of Texas trying to do a
Texas voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: A guy will show up and say he's from
Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll come by himself and buy his limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he'll show up next time with two
friends and they'll both buy their limit
[SPEAKER_03]: or they're all three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he'll come with a truckload next
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like yeah, I brought it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daryl and Daryl and Larry and Larry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all here to buy a whole bunch of
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they hit every shop that they can
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they do good things with that,
but I haven't seen anything improve around
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_14]: They got beer taps installed at the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys could see the look on my face
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In February, I mean, no, don't even get me
gone, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: In February, Colorado collected 1.43
million from a special 10% sales tax on
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational marijuana plus another
438,000 $253 from the state standard 2.9%
[SPEAKER_03]: sales tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, fix some fucking streets and
highways, will ya?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those potholes are fucking me up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 2.9% sales tax on medical marijuana
produced revenues of, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's 1.022.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's a whole other paragraph
because of the way this page advertised.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.022 million in February, an increase
from the 913,000 or nine, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much money?
[SPEAKER_03]: $913,519 collected in January and far
above the $791,000 the state had projected
[SPEAKER_03]: in February.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conversely, the state projected that the
15% excise tax on the sale of recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana would bring in $739,330.
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual total was $339,615,
which is 54% below expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 15% excise tax produced 195,318 in
January.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to read ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see other states reading this article.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody, some governor in some small town
is going, holy shit, they made more money
[SPEAKER_03]: on weed than our whole town made this
year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably some states that are like
the whole state made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's like a little tiny state?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like Rhode Island or something
that's like a block long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, as was the case in January,
Denver generated the largest amount of tax
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue with a 2.9% sales tax on medical
marijuana, totaling $483,432.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have just a pinch of all this
funding that's being thrown around?
[SPEAKER_03]: The 2.9% tax on retail pot brought in
$245,709 with the 10% sales tax adding
[SPEAKER_03]: another $710,930.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since that number was 710, we're going to
take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us for a dab, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do some of the,
I think we need a dab of the green dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you pass me your dabber, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little out of my reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it worth your reach.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy over.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got to get prepared, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got to get some more pins at the cannabis
cup, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you a pin collector now?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I like my pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: The handmade apparel crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a pin guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take all those pins for you if
they're going to fucking hook you up with
[SPEAKER_03]: some pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, their idea is to hook me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to make me one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, no, I don't think I want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just no offense to you guys with all the
pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to follow every trend that
there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got dreadlocks and if those pins get
stuck in my dreads under my hat,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to be fucking murder.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of my problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want to follow every trend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little bit older than a lot of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the pins because I can support
several companies daily and I can all at
[SPEAKER_14]: once wear shirts.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to do like one a day or have a
ridiculously fucked up looking shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like a fucking NASCAR driver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got 72, you got sweet stone and highly
educated on you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take the pins before the NASCAR
jacket.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody wants to throw down some
pins to the agro culture podcast,
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin needs a couple more for his hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll make my hat heavy as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have four or five pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, if TASK made a pin,
if we had a highly educated pin,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rock that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there was a sweet stone pin,
I may put that one on a hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel I'm a minimalist and I feel if,
if I put 20 on there, that takes away from
[SPEAKER_03]: each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have two, then each of those must be
my fucking favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you pin guys just go, huh,
poser, you only got two pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you guys think.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a, I have meaning behind all of my
pins.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll just buy all kinds of pins.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise I'd have a shit load,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to dab Setsuma shatter
extracted with N-butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grown and extracted by Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, it smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you could smell this through the
phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's counting his pins over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's loving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got shatter dragons, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of them for the shatter dragons.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to get me a couple more of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That new crest they made, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dope-ness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dope-ness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what kind of nail is that on that
rig?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a highly educated nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a duality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 14 or an 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: Duality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Domeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to TASC.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a shameless plug for you,
TASC Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only use highly educated stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once TASC sat down and taught me about it,
I was like, dude, there's a reason why
[SPEAKER_03]: you're crushing the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse us while we dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Must be a quarter gram to count.
[SPEAKER_03]: Minitube Mafia.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love these little tiny rigs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, they get so dabbed from them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love them, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin's going to cough for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to attempt to read the rest of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys forgot, we're talking about
how much money Colorado made from the
[SPEAKER_03]: sales of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm trying to do is encourage
other states to join in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just hoping that somebody makes rules
as listening to how much money these
[SPEAKER_03]: people made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you see other people making
money, you want some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you hate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right away, you're like, that fucker's
doing better than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like him anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just inspires me to do better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope other states see all this money
we're making and want to jump in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read now the stab setting in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few months into the first year of
legalized recreational marijuana sales,
[SPEAKER_03]: finding certainty when it comes to pot
revenues has proven to be elusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: In February, Governor John Hickenlooper's
budget office predicted tax and fee
[SPEAKER_03]: revenues for marijuana would total about
$134 million in the fiscal year.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, a month later, the state's
Legislative Council said the total would
[SPEAKER_03]: be half as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Legislators Joint Budget Committee on
Tuesday pledged to craft a bill that would
[SPEAKER_03]: force the state to wait until it had
actual figures before spending the
[SPEAKER_03]: revenues from marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a drug dealer would do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wait before you spend your shit if
you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This story was first published on
thedenverpost.com and I read it from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I should give them credit
often because they help to show out a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I post on all this good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about all that money,
Kev?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a lot of fucking money and
they should do something awesome with it
[SPEAKER_14]: instead of scrabbling it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead of crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess they can't do anything until
they've got actual figures so they can't
[SPEAKER_03]: spend any of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that should be, you can't spend
your money until you fucking have it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems like we're on a good roll with
news.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read one more thing and then
we're going to chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got something I want to rant about
after I read this article.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Denver County Fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin and I had a little talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Denver County Fair is doing something
that I find revolutionary and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Denver County Fair has been known for
being not your normal county fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had some weird and freaky exhibits
before and crazier events and I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture type stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in an article that was on the Denver
Post written by Steve Rabe, I hope I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't butcher your name.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two A's in a row there and that
always fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing with two A's in a row?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: R-A-A-B-E.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Rabe or Rabe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, you wrote a cool article and
I'm going to share it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that's not fucking rude to just
diss on that guy's name like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pot plant growing competitions,
pot brownie judging, pipes, vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read this like we're a
commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pot plant growing competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pot brownie judging, pipes, vaporizers,
rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and by the way, there's also a county
fair taking place.
[SPEAKER_03]: County fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Colorado State Fair one,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so but excuse the Denver County
fair goers for making hay with marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: while public interest is high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's such a great, I read it all fucked
up because I was trying not to laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the first time I read it,
I laughed out loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organizers said Tuesday that the fair's
pot pavilion will now occupy the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: floor of the National Western Complex
during the event, which is August 1st
[SPEAKER_03]: through 3rd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally the pot pavilion was going to
take just half of the third floor,
[SPEAKER_03]: said fair director Dana Kane, but the
response has just been enormous.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having to turn away sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fair is kind of a weird place to go
until we introduce weed and now they have
[SPEAKER_03]: to turn down sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be no actual cannabis on the
premises.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant and brownie judging will take place
off site, then shown via video at the pot
[SPEAKER_03]: pavilion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sponsors and vendors will be showing
and selling smoking accessories.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think they'll be dabbing?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be selling and showing
smoking accessories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Entrance to the third floor will be
restricted to age 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been to some places where I don't
think they intended us for us to dab in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all just started doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just started doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The owner walked around and looked at
everybody like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he realized if he kicked us out,
we were all leaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he just let us dab in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's the fair, but there are
booths and shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just started dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may go to this event.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't live near there, but I may go just
for shits and giggles.
[SPEAKER_14]: I might be wrong, but I think that first
week is the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey now.
[SPEAKER_14]: First week of August.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secret cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if we're not competing, we'll be
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means we got to grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a special crop selected for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got to figure out what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that off the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can know we're going to run for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get to know it's a secret.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prices will be given for fastest joint
rolling using oregano in place of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to do that at a big
table or some shit, you know, so that
[SPEAKER_03]: people can watch and whoever rolls the
fastest joint gets a prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: But part of rolling a good joint is making
it burn good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to smoke that fucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop Pavilion sponsor Medically Correct
will be arranging shuttle rides to nearby
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries and recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I urge some shops to get on that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make some money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kay noted that the Pop Pavilion's poster,
a cherry pie with a crust cut out
[SPEAKER_03]: resembling a marijuana leaf, is outselling
the fair's main poster by a 10 to 1 ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more people want to buy this ad with
the weed leaf on it for a poster for the
[SPEAKER_03]: show or for the fair, which I find
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, people from out of town find it
fascinating, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a friend from New Mexico and he
wanted just my empty packaging from a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispenser.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I just want to show this to my
friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: People want receipts just to take back and
show and people want to frame it and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought weed on the first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the first person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I keep repeating this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the first person to buy recreational
cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary in
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still have the weed that I bought
sealed in the package that they sold it to
[SPEAKER_03]: me in, in which they sold it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in that package still.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on my desk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I marvel at it once in a while.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're never going to hit it, are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I might one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The novelty is wearing off.
[SPEAKER_14]: The novelty is wearing off.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how much you could sell that for
in like 10 years?
[SPEAKER_03]: In like 10 years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be illegal though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or could I just sell it for nostalgic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, in 10 years, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be like collectible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the receipt as well, so I could
keep it with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could like put it all in a frame.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 10 years, we won't have to worry about
me trying to sell that to somebody because
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll just be able to, I could ship it to
wherever and they won't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be completely legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking weed in a jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a little brown baggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to talk about the dude that
ate an edible and jumped from a balcony.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am delimited on my facts on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to talk about shit that I don't
have.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fact on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: We should just.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody ate.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you look it up, it'll pop up and you
could probably look all kinds of shit up
[SPEAKER_14]: on it and read about a lot of it,
but I haven't done it, so I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: express.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll skip that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should respect him and his family
anyway, but you guys should read about
[SPEAKER_03]: that if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that jumped after he ate an
edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is being debated as the possible death
from marijuana, which I highly doubt.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think some other things were.
[SPEAKER_14]: Affecting that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I don't know enough to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not on the website that I saw it on
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's disappeared, so I don't know what
happened to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that odd that it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I said I had a rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: People in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get some hatred and some
backlash, but guys stop shipping weed out
[SPEAKER_03]: of state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just sound like a chick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of things that suck about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, I'm not going to take any credit,
but the people that got this happening
[SPEAKER_03]: worked really hard to get cannabis
legalized for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're low on weed because there are
medical patients that are not getting
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis because the shops have more
profit by selling it recreationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are medical patients that are now
not getting their weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ranted about this on another episode,
but that weed that you're growing could go
[SPEAKER_03]: to somebody in Colorado that needs some
medical weed instead of somebody in a
[SPEAKER_03]: state five states away that just wants to
make a little bit more money and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: making more money off that pound that
you're shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not worth fucking up what we've
worked for.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put a lot of effort into this and
you're going to get busted eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my prediction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like they're pulling people over out
of state with Colorado plates,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to start, Oh, this came from
Colorado and they're going to start
[SPEAKER_03]: cutting open boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, they're just going to
take your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's somebody, you know, it's some
young dude that's ambitious, he'll just
[SPEAKER_03]: jack shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's some old guy or some snooty old
lady, some church lady, your box smells
[SPEAKER_03]: like reefer and says Colorado,
she's going to do what she can to find out
[SPEAKER_03]: what's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess eventually you'll get yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get your bad karma will come to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't wish it upon you, but it'll
happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be a backlash on the
community and the movement, not just the
[SPEAKER_14]: individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't need more cannabis leaving
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard enough to keep Colorado
supplied.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a couple of years, that won't be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got gigantic plans and
everyone's building fucking greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, don't ship it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to drive home with it,
if you want to drive it somewhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even encourage you to drive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're driving quantity somewhere,
keep it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it to a patient that needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients will pay as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't need to make an arm and a
leg.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how much weed you should be
producing through a thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of you guys, I know how much
lights people are hanging now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be a baller or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it to a patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't send it out of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: No disrespect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to fuck things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to mess anything up
because we've worked hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough of that rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to go on about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, you were saying a lot of cool,
Kevin, dude across from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just talking to all you bros,
but bro, you were saying a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff about working at the shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about which shop you work at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you want to do that on
there or anything, but Kev's at Budtender.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do you do over there?
[SPEAKER_14]: I just clean up and Budtend and I give
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty much there in encyclopedia now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the part that kind of has me
inspired to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That part of it, being able to sit and
answer questions for people and give them
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis knowledge and let them know how
it'll help them or what might be better
[SPEAKER_14]: for them or why.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just really neat to see someone come
in that may have never had cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: before, but had read some stuff about it
and had decided to give it a try.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they come in very uncomfortable and
unsure and uneasy, which if you don't know
[SPEAKER_14]: much about anything, you're going to be
like that with any kind of new thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then by the time they leave and after
I answer their questions and stuff,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's really nice that they're much more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're enthused.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're already feeling better and they
haven't even had any of the medicine yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of that is just spiritual
uplifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really good for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's good for your karma too,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're definitely going to get some
love back from the world for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my favorite part of my job for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like doing that more than I like selling
anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: On the rec side, probably 60 or 70.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny because I was making fun of
Texas earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons a day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes they're close to Pueblo's
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's intense, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Texas is driving home with a bunch of
men.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine having to drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to assume that's like 10 hours
to get home to Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a map in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 hours to drive home.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you can only buy a couple of
quarters?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like us having to drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we used to complain if we'd have to
drive up to Denver to find some good food.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to go to the shop all the way,
a hundred miles away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we wouldn't be limited because we're
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go by two ounces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys are coming 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they hit.
[SPEAKER_14]: They love the experience, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll hit a few shops and they'll try to
hit Denver, a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have people come in.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a dude come in from Beijing,
China.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: International.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo Colorado shoppers are from Beijing,
China.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he speak English?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a dude come from Australia.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_14]: What did he call weed?
[SPEAKER_14]: Did he have a neat word for it?
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: He knew a lot about it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was knowledgeable on his butt.
[SPEAKER_03]: On my website, you can see where people
are looking, where people have viewed my
[SPEAKER_03]: website, what country they're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of New Zealand and Australia
hits hit my website and they look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: gallery the gallery is down right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm improving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Wade took a bunch of killer
photos of some grateful dog and some
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll get that on the gallery for you
on the iRegenetics, iRegeneticsColorado
[SPEAKER_03]: .com.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the galleries under construction,
but a lot of those come from Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the views.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if I should even say
this, but there's a lot of guys when they
[SPEAKER_14]: get out of service, they just,
they love coming in, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've worked in a dispensary as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: I see them kind of breathe.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I experienced that.
[SPEAKER_14]: When they start to talk about that,
they're just like, I just got out and I
[SPEAKER_14]: just, I need something to help with PTSD
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine you've been around blowing up and
having to watch your back for a month or
[SPEAKER_14]: two or six.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you talk to them about a certain
strain that might help with a forum or
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever, you can see them take a deep
sigh of relief.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, that kind of shit's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: They can put down their guard a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite is that look when,
so I was the first one to shop at that
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary, but then I went back later on
just to go hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew a lot of people that were there in
the line and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just kind of hanging out,
watching people walk out of the dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: the first time with that look on their
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like they wanted to do
cartwheels and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was awesome seeing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said you liked recommending strains
to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pointing my pin at you like I'm
fucking Obama.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, I can't even do it, but you said
you liked recommending strains to people
[SPEAKER_03]: for like PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were a vet and I had PTSD,
what would you tell me to smoke?
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the strains I'd like to pull out
for them is a plush berry because it helps
[SPEAKER_14]: them.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll help them calm down a little bit,
but still give them a little pep so they
[SPEAKER_14]: don't like crash out or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ironic because I thought of Jilly
Bean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out TGA Subcool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a plush berry is black cherry soda
times Space Queen and Jilly Bean is orange
[SPEAKER_03]: velvet times Space Queen, both from TGA
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently Subcool genetics,
you're good for the PTSD vets.
[SPEAKER_14]: I recommend the cheesequake as well when
we have it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends on what we have at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like that funky cheesequake makes
my nose wrinkle up.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some people that come in and you
show it to them and they're like,
[SPEAKER_14]: wow, that smells interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're kind of excited about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's other people that are
like, that smells like cheese.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get that away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that cheesy smelling weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got their particular flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people get surprised when they tell
me what kind of a high they want or what
[SPEAKER_14]: they're looking for mainly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll pull out three or four different
strains and they'll be like, well,
[SPEAKER_14]: what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_14]: And they'll all be similar in the high
that they get, but they'll be so different
[SPEAKER_14]: in their flavor and smell profiles.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just like, smell them and whichever
one smells the best to you, that's the one
[SPEAKER_14]: you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a neat idea that you just
said that maybe subconsciously our nose,
[SPEAKER_03]: follow the nose and always nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe your body is like that one right
there has got the stuff you need because
[SPEAKER_03]: we like the sour diesel a lot and it works
medicinally very well if that's your
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a medicinal plant for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does help with a lot of people's
ailments.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do love the OG cushions and those
are good for my... When I smoke sour
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel, I always describe it as my ADD
turns into a cartoon and just starts
[SPEAKER_03]: spinning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The circus comes on when I smoke too much
sour D.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just get like, it's like I'm in a
cartoon slash movie and it's just going
[SPEAKER_03]: faster than it should and I can't throw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I start nine projects and leave them all
sitting there and don't finish any of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sour diesel for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind it sometimes, but it can make
a mess of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always goes right to my head,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my Chong joke, my Cheech and Chong
reference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I do a part of the show where we
give thanks to somebody, but I read
[SPEAKER_03]: something on the internet that I thought
we should laugh at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to call this the dipshit of the
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got to find this woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: The headline says, woman calls police,
complains about bad weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woman tells police drug dealer won't give
her refund by Michael Wesp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on Michael for having a normal
fucking name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess where these people are from?
[SPEAKER_14]: We're from Lufkin, Texas.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: We should have just rode up with someone
and got some Colorado weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a refund.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just hear a weird thump?
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone kicking down the front door.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we're cool in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we just go silent for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're cool guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's barging in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's from the wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's windy here in Colorado tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been windy for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting to be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold is shifting and it's getting to the
warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yoga pants season in Denver.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's beginning to get to where it sucks to
be inside when you're working.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to come out and get some sunshine
of your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out from under the grow lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back to our celebrity sighting
in Lufkin, Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Texas woman found herself behind bars
Thursday after calling Lufkin,
[SPEAKER_03]: Texas authorities to complain about bad
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that quality control?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll call the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Lufkin Police Department received a
call for help from the 200 block of Forest
[SPEAKER_03]: Block Boulevard around 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: The caller, Evelyn Louise Hamilton,
37 of Lufkin, complained to dispatchers
[SPEAKER_03]: about a bad batch of drugs her dealer
would not refund.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Texas has an M-E-T.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they definitely don't have a sense of
humor either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So responding officers asked Hamilton if
she had any marijuana on her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She admitted to having some pot and turned
over a small baggie hidden in her bra.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was then arrested for possession of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her bail was set at $500.
[SPEAKER_14]: At least they didn't string her up by her
tits or nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Evelyn Louise Hamilton of Lufkin,
Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're my dipshit of the week and you're
my first dipshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I honor someone who is cool and I
just want to say, don't do that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think any of our listeners need
any explanation on why not to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't call the police about bad weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take another dab and then wrap
this show up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even say that into my microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard you in the headphones,
so I think we got you a little bit at
[SPEAKER_03]: least.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you want to talk about
while I get a couple of dabs on the
[SPEAKER_03]: dabber?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably think of something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, think quickly because now's your
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're getting stuff on the dabber right
now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'll just talk about you getting
stuff on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to see one of these monster
dabs that I'm known for on the show?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it usually fucks me up so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take one too.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to hear as a closing
song?
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to put that up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're just putting it on the spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: $100 bag is what I want to hear.
Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking epic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Closing song will be called $100 bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually not originally written by
Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send a sticker, two iRegenetic
stickers.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the first person that tweets me the
name of the artist that originally
[SPEAKER_03]: recorded the song $100 bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to tweet me at iGrowCulture and
say, send me two stickers because the
[SPEAKER_03]: artist is, and fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send you two iRegenetic stickers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll contact you and you can send me your
mailing info.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interaction with the peoples,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the people that listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Kevin just took a drink and tried to
speak and I think you sounded like Ray
[SPEAKER_03]: Romano a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of Kermit the Romano.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to get that down really
well so that way I can get super famous
[SPEAKER_14]: doing just speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys just heard some weird gurgling
sounds on the mic, I don't know if that
[SPEAKER_03]: came through.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our friend Barney.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our friend Barney.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin's got some really active sounding
intestines.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't elaborate too much on Kevin's
conditions, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did some rerouting inside of him from
some childhood things, but sometimes he
[SPEAKER_03]: sounds like a freaking drainage system.
[SPEAKER_13]: It still works.
[SPEAKER_13]: It hasn't started leaking yet either,
so we're good so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you're draining like
gallons of stuff out through your body
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And new people, when new people are around
and it happens, they get like worried
[SPEAKER_03]: about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at you like, did you just shit
all over that couch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was Barney.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Barney.
[SPEAKER_03]: We named it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We named it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did he get the name Barney?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just watched the show too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The show being How I Met Your Mother.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just watched the show a lot and that's
my favorite character on the show is N.P
[SPEAKER_14]: .H.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking Barney.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stinson.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gave him the N.P.H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: N.P.H.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take dabs at separate times
so that one of us could be talking this
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you call that a man dab?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a dude dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hurt myself here on the show
with you guys just to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got two gigantic dabs over there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to do both of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the other one's for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless somebody wants to ninja dab me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to sit here in front of this
microphone and talk.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to just use that as an excuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we talked about a sniper dab or a
time bomb?
[SPEAKER_03]: Teach people about a sniper bomb or a time
bomb.
[SPEAKER_14]: That sniper dab when you put the dab on
the bottom of the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when people carb cap their shit,
they get another dab all surprised like,
[SPEAKER_14]: because no one looks under the fucking
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before you do a dab, you just do the dab
and put your carb cap on and that's how it
[SPEAKER_03]: works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beware.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, here I'll pass this
over to you and I'll ramble for a minute
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a dabby dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a dab.
There's a torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of accessories involved in
taking a nice quality dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I enjoy it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to cough and cough and
cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was supposed to say something while you
took a dab and I totally don't remember
[SPEAKER_03]: what.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to remind everybody to check out
my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: iGrowCulture has an Instagram and a
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at iRegenetics on Facebook and
Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our dipshit of the week
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was funny in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys liked that as much as I
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got somebody that you'd like me
to honor in either way, a positive or a
[SPEAKER_03]: negative way, I'll call someone a dipshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think that we should say thanks to
them also, let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I don't remember what that one thing
I was going to say was, we're just going
[SPEAKER_03]: to let Kev choke into the mic for a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fucking rude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to play $100 bag from the
Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I thank everybody for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm really dabbed out right at the
end of the show here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying not to cough too much on you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_14]: Just thanks for having me on again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to cough with you for a minute
and listen to part of this song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great afternoon, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a fat dab and give your mama a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was living in a single room with three
other individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was a male and the other two
were females.
[SPEAKER_00]: God only knows what they were up to in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the
least bit surprised to learn that all four
[SPEAKER_00]: of them habitually smoke marijuana
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, ladies and gentlemen, happy 420
weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the agriculture podcast episode
number six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's so dabbed out already at this
table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't catch our breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you guys are having as good of a 420
week as we are over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My eyes are watering from the dab I just
took.
[SPEAKER_03]: My throat hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a sip of this drink
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to give credit to the intro song.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Smoke Dude Joints by
Sublime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to give credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's sneezing over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's kill the music and get down to
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try it one official time
without music in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my head's glued back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to episode number six of the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That feels better.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're sitting here with my buddy Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Kevin from Elevated Concentrations
across the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard somebody yesterday, I gave him a
dab and he said, my head feels like I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: inside of a tin can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the dab I just took, I know how
that poor dude feels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

look on their face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, holy crap, we're dabbed out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm staring at the floor like,
please breathe.

I hope you're finding something cool to do
[SPEAKER_03]: to celebrate 420.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much most every major person in the
cannabis culture from like the 16th on
[SPEAKER_14]: through the 20th is going to be in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are landing already.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing it on Facebook and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in Denver, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a lot of footage of epicness
happenings.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, this is what happens on the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, we are dabbing it up over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabsler 5000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I feel like I maybe should have
wiped my nose before we started this
[SPEAKER_04]: because I feel like I'm just full of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Full of snot, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dabs get you running.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens to some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys know where, where do you think
the 420 name came from?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard that it came from students in
Harvard or Yale where they would go,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be the time that they would get
out of school and they would go and smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: and it just affiliated from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, besides being like the almighty,
everybody knows Hitler's birthday.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I heard in like the early
seventies at a high school, like four
[SPEAKER_14]: kids, I forget the name of the high
school.
[SPEAKER_14]: Four kids would meet up and that was,
yeah, they would, they would smoke and
[SPEAKER_14]: that was just kind of their, their time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm on the host.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those teenagers were actually from San
Rafael, California and they called
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves the Waldo's and yeah,
they hung out near a statue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lewis Pasteur statue on the grounds of
San Rafael high school is their meeting
[SPEAKER_03]: place and 420 was their meeting time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where these dudes coined the
420.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's part of what we're here
for.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're here to inform.
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't it kind of spread through the
Grateful Dead and stuff after that?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that stuff is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where a lot of it spread through is
the dead tour, fish tour, spreading the
[SPEAKER_03]: wookie kids were spreading that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was trying to explain the wookie kids
to Christie the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, I, I don't know if I was
able to do it well enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to take her to a fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never pointed a look, look,
look.
[SPEAKER_03]: I represent that crowd so I can talk shit
about the woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to tell her that,
you know, that's basically what Jeff is,
[SPEAKER_05]: but she didn't understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do that segment called give thanks
every, every show.
[SPEAKER_03]: One time we did a shit head, which I
thought was cool, but we did a gift thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do the gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this time we're going to give thanks
to the Waldo's because those guys coined
[SPEAKER_03]: something that has lasted forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's become integral to the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see 420 friendly when you're trying to
rent out an apartment or if you're trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to go somewhere, 420 friendly is a common
phrase.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having the cannabis cup on 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's how big this shit got.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a neutral phrase that I feel like
even if you're not in the community,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can use.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: No 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd just be a nice simple sign,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I wouldn't go there, but all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys know who made up 710 just
since we're on that rant?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Who exactly?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know who it was, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say it on the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about if you guys are listening right
now, shoot me a tweet at, at I grow
[SPEAKER_03]: culture and the first person to correctly
answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was during a conference call
with two popular entities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they text me the two that I'm
thinking, or if they tweet me the two that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking, I'll send you a couple of
iry genetic stickers or the I heart dab
[SPEAKER_03]: sticker in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remind me and tweet me about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the second sticker contest I've
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody get that going stickers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to stick her up all your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one on my computer at the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got an iry genetic sticker on the
computer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one you gave me the night of the
shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a weird random topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows about Sriracha?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sriracha is that lovely, delicious red hot
sauce that all of us hippies like to put
[SPEAKER_03]: on fucking almost everything we eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just never ate the Sriracha factory
in Irwindale, California has been recently
[SPEAKER_03]: declared a public nuisance by Irwindale
city council.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think it's funny because it relates
to the Denver topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people were complaining about weed
smells, uh, the pungent pepper fumes burn
[SPEAKER_03]: locals, eyes and throat and cause
respiratory issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hoi Fong foods opened the plant two years
ago and they've been working to minimize
[SPEAKER_03]: odors.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need some carbon filters or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, then they have 90 days to correct the
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: This could lead to a shortage of my
favorite rooster sauce, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't let this happen, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hoi Fong has to get their shit together
and make it not stink so badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you write them and recommend
them a good carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's going to take some industrial
strength shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They claim to have it under control,
but I thought that was interesting that,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the neighbors are complaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: They feel like they're getting tear gassed
all day over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's got to suck.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fucked.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fucked.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would want to discount on my fucking
rent.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, your landlord didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's probably part of the problem
because people are going, Hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: was it really that big of a problem in
Denver?
[SPEAKER_04]: When it first started that it was,
it was that apparent, like you couldn't go
[SPEAKER_04]: downtown anywhere without smelling pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there were certain neighborhoods,
like there's a little commercial area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's like a commercial industrial area
where it was cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where all the warehouses are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just stinks, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can, I could smell it and I don't
even notice the smell of weed in some
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I walk into dispensaries and other
people go, Oh, it smells so good in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be like, real, what does it smell
like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Describe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm immune, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody was interested in the Sriracha
story at the table here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will get somebody's attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm sorry that your hot sauce story
didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm crushed inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use that hot sauce a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was recently, you guys got to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the important part of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, your microphone's going to fall out of
the stand, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to adjust it in the little
clippy thing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should see how dabbed he looked trying
to fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Senate bill has just been
introduced in a Senate bill 177,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, uh, Senate bill 14 dash one seven
seven Colorado Senate bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is called the drug endangered
child for the purposes of cases of child
[SPEAKER_03]: abuse or neglect in the children's code.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what they're trying to do,
what they're attempting to do is they want
[SPEAKER_03]: to, there are no rules in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they come into your house and you're
doing drugs in the house and there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: child there, there aren't really set rules
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is that there are vague rules and
things, but they're trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to put like definitely a
street code, some rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'll read from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll say, it'll make more sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: When controlled substances, whether legal
or illegal are used, produced,
[SPEAKER_03]: or distributed in the presence of
children, a greater likelihood exists for
[SPEAKER_03]: harm to the children from caretaker
incapacitation access to dangerous drug
[SPEAKER_03]: production components, lack of
supervision, unhealthy indoor air quality
[SPEAKER_03]: exposure to dangerous non non-drug
criminal behaviors and other circumstances
[SPEAKER_03]: that pose a danger to children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Law enforcement agencies, human services,
family courts, and the criminal justice
[SPEAKER_03]: system currently do not have a common
definition of a drug endangered child.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was trying to stumble into,
but dads are fucking making it clogged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Law enforcement agencies have human
services and statutory mandated reporters
[SPEAKER_03]: of suspected child maltreatment need
common tools and training.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucked all that up trying to say it,
but these guys need common tools and
[SPEAKER_03]: training to identify a child at risk of
abuse and neglect as a result of the use,
[SPEAKER_03]: production, and distribution of drugs in a
child's environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: This goes on and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a few things that kind of
pissed off a lot of people in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got some feathers ruffled here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A drug endangered child means any child in
a case in which any of the following
[SPEAKER_03]: situations occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: The presence of a child or on the premises
where a child is found or resides,
[SPEAKER_03]: a controlled substance is defined in
section 18, 18-102.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff here that's going
to sound ridiculous to you guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's three words here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Manufactured, distributed, cultivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultivated is aiming at us.
[SPEAKER_03]: At growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: At growing, at marijuana users.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are also other things in this,
in the language, that will come back to
[SPEAKER_03]: bite cannabis users, medical marijuana
patients, growers, smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will come to bite us in our ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, because, well, can I mention
that you've got kids and that you're a pot
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's kind of why I brought you
on this episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I said this, you got pissed because,
well, tell me why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just moved here from- This is my friend
Adam, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: A non, I guess, non-friendly state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-friendly state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was illegal as fuck where you were.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, anything pretty much east of the
Mississippi, unless you're north in
[SPEAKER_05]: Michigan and things like that,
DC, it's not even relevant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's no shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the states, even Florida,
where I'm from, is starting to look
[SPEAKER_04]: towards medicalization, but it's still
going to take three years to pass all the
[SPEAKER_04]: bullshit gray lines and to even place it
into law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before it gets rolling around,
I mean, when I left there, they were still
[SPEAKER_04]: writing laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying if you had more than three sprouted
seeds, then your ass is going to jail for
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more along the lines of, yeah,
the dabs are really making this hard now.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else is dabbed out listening too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you came here to Colorado to get away
from- Go to prison for having three
[SPEAKER_03]: sprouted seeds and having a little bit of
cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely having cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having the ability to come here and as a
legal adult who follows the laws,
[SPEAKER_05]: I should be able to grow my six plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're saying if I follow the laws,
then I'll have no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're also saying that if I'm using
marijuana- Well, it says cultivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're cultivating marijuana in your
backyard and your child lives there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got a drug endangered child.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hard because I just moved here and
got my med card and they said that- You
[SPEAKER_04]: thought you were cool, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only that, but by Colorado state law,
I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you said earlier that this is strictly
a Colorado- This is a Colorado bill,
yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a Colorado bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this isn't anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just moved here to get away from the
stimulus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've had issues where me and her
have had arguments and then DCF is in our
[SPEAKER_05]: life, just like they have to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: They step in for 45 days or however long,
they give us a piss test.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make sure they come by a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: They ask the kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: They see this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had no problems beyond that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what it's been always is if you can
pee in this cup and the line isn't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always what it's been.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the line's there, then we're going
to have a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they're saying that, oh no,
go ahead and move out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I packed my family up and moved 1200
miles to come out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now you're three months into it,
they're going to pass a law and saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't cultivate six plants in the
backyard where I follow everything state
[SPEAKER_05]: law-wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the plants in the backyard
right now, but I moved here in the promise
[SPEAKER_05]: of that's what I'm doing this year,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was an amendment to this bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, and I'm going to skip some of the
technical part just because it bores our
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners and it makes me stumble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing in this part four shall prohibit
the use, possession, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution, or manufacture of a
controlled substance that is permitted by
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado law and that is used,
possessed, cultivated, distributed,
[SPEAKER_03]: or manufactured in accordance with
Colorado law in a situation that does not
[SPEAKER_03]: pose a threat of injury to a child's life
or health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are vaguely trying to help us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I still feel like this is pointed
towards smokers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the guy that guides me with my
little bit of my legal ideas, the guy that
[SPEAKER_03]: got me onto this here to want to talk
about it, he says, that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it's still the way that it's
worded.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are still going to get boned in the
butt is essentially what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about prescription pills?
[SPEAKER_03]: What about alcohol?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I understand those are
regulated a little bit differently,
[SPEAKER_03]: but this is more aimed at like meth labs
and weed grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sort of thing, because the things
you're aiming for are regulated by other
[SPEAKER_03]: entities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all down with tackling down on the
meth labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's no way to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's part of what this is going to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the mix, we're getting caught in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They worded it to put us to fuck us up in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm scrolling through this guy's
Facebook page because I had the page to
[SPEAKER_03]: where I could find the people's email
addresses that we need to email so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can try to stop this crap from happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all need that email.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have kids, but my issue with this
thing is there are a lot of new studies
[SPEAKER_14]: with cannabis helping a lot of children
and a lot of families moving here to help
[SPEAKER_14]: their children for diseases, epilepsy,
cancer, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so how are you going to make this bill
that they can't cultivate medicine that
[SPEAKER_14]: their child needs?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be endangering them?
[SPEAKER_14]: Saving their life is going to be
endangering them?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a very completely
hypocritical bill.
[SPEAKER_14]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have multimillion viewed videos and
such things in SMBC on people doing
[SPEAKER_05]: stories on how they're moving here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marines and homemakers that don't even use
marijuana, that are moving here just to
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I would understand that this
law would not even threaten them is what
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody would say who is in power.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this, they would have nothing to worry
about that because they would be under
[SPEAKER_05]: accordance by state law.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously they're not there to do it
illegally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going after the illegal people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how many times would this law,
if they don't amend it a couple more
[SPEAKER_05]: times, would that, would that vague law
fall into, oh, we came in and there was
[SPEAKER_05]: four people in there smoking a blunt and
it's all smoky in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the kids in the back room in the
kitchen or, you know, and then kids in bed
[SPEAKER_05]: sleeping.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you say you don't have kids,
but I'm sure you know, plenty of people
[SPEAKER_05]: who do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's say you went over there and you
guys were out in the living room and
[SPEAKER_05]: getting down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the kids are in the back or even in
the backyard, you know, and running in and
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the house like kids like to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cops come up, knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to look like an
irresponsible person?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because you're in your own damn house
exactly where the Colorado state law told
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm obviously a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a big ass grow at my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my daughter does not live with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She lives with her mom because,
because partially because of what I do,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think it's better to have her
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she's, I feel a little,
she doesn't need to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: child.
[SPEAKER_03]: If she were to come here to the house and
I happen to have, I wonder if my seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: would count.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they were, if they were popped,
I just need some seeds in a bag,
[SPEAKER_03]: some seeds in a jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if the rigs sitting here right here
on the table?
[SPEAKER_03]: What if me and the kid come in and we walk
in and the rigs just sitting there on the
[SPEAKER_03]: table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she suddenly a drug endangered child
because the rigs on the table and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, what else edibles, they're really
hunting on edibles right now because the
[SPEAKER_03]: way they're shaped like candies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things like that, you know,
if you had, you know, is that a drug
[SPEAKER_03]: endangered child in my mind that qualifies
because that's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You failed your, that's your medical
marijuana Brownie or cookie should be
[SPEAKER_03]: treated just like your Percocets,
your Vicodin is your heart medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a drug endangered child.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, and, uh, I got to support some kind
of control and some kind of law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I love kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my own kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if you fed my kid a Brownie,
I'd fuck you up and press charges on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's your drug endangering my child
is the way I got to, if we want this to be
[SPEAKER_14]: legalized and supported, we have to also
support regulation.
[SPEAKER_14]: It also has to be reasonable regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they write something with so
much gray area, so much gray area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like struggling to catch
back up.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do the definitions after they make
the regulations, which is here's what we
[SPEAKER_03]: can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bill has been written.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been passed on or it's been amended.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's been passed on to the next
step.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend, Kevin, a, I'm going to try to
say your name, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never tried to say it because I feel
rude when I mess up people's names.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's see, there's an H and an M my mile,
my Malgie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my Malgie, Kevin, my Malgie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be confident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin, my Malgie, dude, if that's wrong,
I'm fucking sorry, but this guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's a really great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He educates me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, we're looking for a few
volunteers to help send a few emails over
[SPEAKER_03]: the weekend to the members of the state
judiciary committee, urging them to vote
[SPEAKER_03]: no on Senate bills, 177 and 172.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a list of judiciary committee folks
that we need to email.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tweet these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make myself a note right now
to tweet these.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want them email Lucia Guzman,
Linda Newell, Michael Johnston,
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve King, and Kevin Lundberg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll put all these emails in a tweet
so that you guys can get those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've got some computer time,
you're sitting there taking a dab,
[SPEAKER_03]: write one email, say, please do not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Copy and paste it to all these email
address or just type in all these email
[SPEAKER_03]: addresses, write one email, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cuss them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, please do not pass this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We find it unfair.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are smarter than that, write
something smart, but take some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're writing a professional letter here
for something that's going to count.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even for me, you know, I'm,
I'm, I'm a felon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get a passport.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't leave the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: The military doesn't want me anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already ruined all my chances.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, even here, I feel obligated to do
something because this is the state that I
[SPEAKER_05]: live in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, you told me last, last week
when you mentioned this to me,
[SPEAKER_05]: that this affects me, you know,
pretty much anything with marijuana laws
[SPEAKER_05]: affect me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you're solo and you're,
when you're able to just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: catch a charge and, or even a ticket or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's, then it's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to jail for three nights,
you know, and that's more likely what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to jail on Friday and I'm
not going to get right until Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like you've done this before,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Several times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but that's, that's what's going to
happen, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and if you, if you're here in
Colorado, just, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: like he said, take 15 minutes,
write out a decent paragraph on why it
[SPEAKER_05]: should, it should be rethought.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be playing on Facebook
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be on Instagram,
posting a fucking selfie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the candy crush saga sucks anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, uh, let's take a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm going to play a song in the
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we want to hear?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what we're going to play.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin's got an iMic.
[SPEAKER_03]: iMic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a, that's not like an iDevice
or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you get so dabbed that you're
using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like he's using a magnifier or a
magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like he's using a periscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't look like a magnifying glass,
which you just did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that hand motion there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they call that one the twisted
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if I play a song right here,
if it's going to make some shit drop out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll just use a dab time again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: iTunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be loud guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize if this comes in real loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jam it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little task rock.
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can read your mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to take a dab and we're
going to change the vibe of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's been real newsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dab the fuck out at the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get back into a fun vibe
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird high as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never tried to do a podcast that
high before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, sure, let's talk about news.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was like, wait, it's my turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different when we all look at you
with the microphone, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you don't get mad at me for playing
your songs in the background, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it'll benefit you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Task Rock, tasking Linus, T and L,
the movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just grabbed the rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's my turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one rig at the table today.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I come over here, you're like,
Oh, I'm going to show you all my rigs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, dude, I'm just going to come
over here with a cabinet one time and just
[SPEAKER_05]: slide it into the back of the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's going to be like, what's that
for?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your bookshelf for all your rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should just bring them all to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wouldn't be room for anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm dabbing out the little roster rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it one time and you only have three
guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: That way, you know, you can have it all on
that, you know, that end of the- All
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some grateful dog dabs done by elevated
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a man dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still blowing smoke out of my left
ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cannabis Cup is this weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Denver Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a booth or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm throwing down a few packs of seeds at
a couple of booths.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do some giveaways and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm just going to roam around and
high five people and meet people and have
[SPEAKER_03]: a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are probably catching this
episode right before the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So find me there and say what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tasty dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys make me jelly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I'm fully- It's my favorite day of
the year.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been watching it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been watching it for almost like five
or six years steadily, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: on YouTube and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's- It's the most fun I ever have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get a GoPro and just, you know,
strap the GoPro to your chest.
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like every year is more fun
because I meet more people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, imagine looking back 20 years,
you know, at that footage of you,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the first couple of years,
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's also a big event in Civic
Center Park.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The event in Civic Center Park that they
do, they will not allow cannabis smoking,
[SPEAKER_03]: but guess what they will allow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver city officials expect organizers of
this weekend 420 event at Denver Civic
[SPEAKER_03]: Center Park to actively discourage public
pot smoking, an activity that is illegal
[SPEAKER_03]: under Colorado law.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn down the Task Rocks
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that's a- This song is called Do It
Again, by the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot to shut it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just loving it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounding iry in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always sounds fucking iry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article I'm reading is coming from
Toke of the Town, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's written by William Breeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good writing, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will discourage public pot
smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, liquor will be sold and can be
consumed at the McNichols building on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Civic Center complex during the festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: Among those who see this situation as a
contradictory is Miguel Lopez,
[SPEAKER_03]: the 420 Weekend's organizer who applied
for the right to sell beer in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev's got his hand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: First question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it also illegal to drink in public?
[SPEAKER_15]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_15]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just the first basic question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says the beer and liquor will not be
allowed outside the McNichols building
[SPEAKER_03]: during the two-day event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can't just get it and go outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in a controlled area, is actually
what it says.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that kind of fucks that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but man, so- But it's a 420
event.
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you going to fucking have alcohol
and not weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're trying to discourage us from
smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And giving us booze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see- Make it more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not hoping for bad shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really hoping it goes well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's see if DUIs increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if there's problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect case study right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out that alcohol is dangerous
and cannabis is safer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you not seen that case study they did
on LA or whatever where they put some,
[SPEAKER_04]: a numerous amount of people behind the
wheel high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in most of the times it came out,
they had a higher percentage of like
[SPEAKER_04]: staying in, they were more aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would believe you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't condone driving under the
influence of any substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they were closed course, but that's
what I'm saying is it was- It's got a
[SPEAKER_03]: lawyer over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I fucking, I believe you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally believe that that could fucking
work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause sometimes I feel like I got to calm
down and smoke some weed and my brain goes
[SPEAKER_03]: too fast.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a better case study.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's, let's see.
[SPEAKER_14]: their revenue shit like I bought that
don't buy any booze yeah see them shit
[SPEAKER_14]: themselves for spending all this money on
fucking vending and bring it that they
[SPEAKER_14]: don't sell a single one bring flask of
tinctures not one just sit there and swing
[SPEAKER_03]: tinctures all day oh gosh people are gonna
be wrecked gonna be wrecked I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking of being wrecked I was kind of
saying let's see if there's gonna be more
[SPEAKER_03]: DUIs guys be safe and be smart for us
please you're probably listening to this
[SPEAKER_03]: on 420 weekend which means the cops are
paying attention the shit's catching on
[SPEAKER_03]: they know what's up especially here in
Colorado if you're in California
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington Oregon Michigan places where
they have where the medical scene is
[SPEAKER_03]: getting popular and just weed is getting
rampant they're gonna be watching for us
[SPEAKER_03]: to be high and they're gonna try to find
people to make examples of and revenue off
[SPEAKER_03]: of because they don't like us potheads
even though we voted it in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: officials and the police do not like it so
they're gonna try to find ways to fuck us
[SPEAKER_03]: so be careful they see it as a
money-making revenue alcohol is just a
[SPEAKER_03]: lube to fuck you if you're a responsible
drinker that's cool but please don't be
[SPEAKER_03]: over dabbed even like that yeah be safe be
safe we love you guys we want to have you
[SPEAKER_05]: back for more episodes so don't buy beer
yeah no beer on 420 no beer veto that
[SPEAKER_14]: that's for March 17th March 17th through
March 20th no beer but then on St.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick's Day get totally totally shitted

[SPEAKER_03]: she'll probably listen are you are you a
fan of miss coral you should see the look
[SPEAKER_03]: on this dude's face coral I think you
might he might be a fan not way before way
[SPEAKER_04]: before she was I mean I remember like when
Paul introduced her and shit like that
[SPEAKER_04]: like oh this is so-and-so you know we've
seen her change we've seen her change from
[SPEAKER_03]: a you know petite little tiny girl she's
turned into like a full-on cannabis queen
[SPEAKER_03]: now she's pretty badass it's got a lot of
respect for that girl she uh it's not like
[SPEAKER_04]: oh my eyes shine for her it's more like
you know I've watched her gain her YouTube
[SPEAKER_03]: career yeah essentially she's part of what
inspired this podcast dude and she's part
[SPEAKER_04]: of it me being a twitch streamer slash you
know that's that's essentially I'd love to
[SPEAKER_03]: do YouTube for a long time but it's give
yourself a shout out where does somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: find your dumbass overgrowthegov.twitch
overgrowthegov.twitch all right no
[SPEAKER_03]: actually coral is part of what inspired
this show she's uh she knows the news she
[SPEAKER_03]: does the talk she's really friendly but
she doesn't know about grow and so I fill
[SPEAKER_03]: in the blank where coral misses with the
grow she tried there first yeah but I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not her wheelhouse and no offense to
her that's just not her wheelhouse you
[SPEAKER_03]: know she does plenty of other she's a
social media genius I don't know how she
[SPEAKER_03]: keeps up all right I want to read one more
article we're gonna take a couple dabs and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we're gonna end this episode get out
here quick and easy we're it's 420 man we
[SPEAKER_03]: could be this dabbed and do a half quick
episode jeez yeah yeah whoa whoa just got
[SPEAKER_03]: real person don't don't yeah all right
don't pull out in here you'll make a mess
[SPEAKER_03]: here's an article from the cannabis it
doesn't it doesn't give anybody any credit
[SPEAKER_03]: for writing it no person I'm trying to
find his name I like to give people credit
[SPEAKER_03]: it just says no New York that's who gets
credit is New York where the credit goes
[SPEAKER_03]: is New York so a small study of casual
marijuana smokers has turned up evidence
[SPEAKER_03]: of change in the brain a possible sign of
trouble ahead reach the researchers say
[SPEAKER_03]: the young adults who volunteered for the
study were not dependent on pot nor did
[SPEAKER_03]: they show any marijuana related problems
what we think we are seeing here is a very
[SPEAKER_03]: early indication of what becomes a problem
later on with prolonged use things like
[SPEAKER_03]: lack of focus and impaired judgment said
dr. hands brighter that's got to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: German name a study author longer-term
studies will be needed to see if such
[SPEAKER_03]: brain changes cause any symptoms over time
like how long it would do we've been
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking weed for a hundred and something
years like man there's I mean with all
[SPEAKER_05]: you've seen the the cannabinoid receptors
we have a brain now you know I'm saying
[SPEAKER_04]: that's that's been found in the past five
years now that they just open research
[SPEAKER_03]: previous studies have shown mixed results
in looking for brain changes for marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: use perhaps because of difference in the
techniques used he and others noted in
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday's issue of the Journal of
neuroscience what that makes me think
[SPEAKER_03]: guess what he's thinking well they don't
know because they're not in the scene
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev's looking at me like he knows what I'm
leading to it's the dabs bro concentrates
[SPEAKER_03]: and because the new advanced ways of
consuming all right the study is among the
[SPEAKER_03]: first to focus on possible brain effects
and recreational pot smokers said dr. Nora
[SPEAKER_03]: Volkow director of the National Institute
on drug abuse the federal agency helped
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for the work she called the work
important but preliminary the 20 pot users
[SPEAKER_03]: in the study ages 18 to 25 said they
smoked marijuana an average of about four
[SPEAKER_03]: days a week for an average of average
total of about 11 joints half of them
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked fewer than six joints a week
researchers scanned their brains and
[SPEAKER_03]: compared the results of those 20 non-users
compared those results to 20 non-users who
[SPEAKER_03]: were matched of age sex and other traits
the results showed differences in two
[SPEAKER_03]: brain areas associated with emotion and
motivation it's hard to argue with yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the brain and the nucleus accumens
I don't know how to say that word I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be honest user showed higher density
than non-users as well as different
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in shape of those areas both
differences were more pronounced in those
[SPEAKER_03]: who reported smoking more marijuana the
doctor also said large studies are needed
[SPEAKER_03]: to explore whether casual to moderate
marijuana use really does cause anatomical
[SPEAKER_03]: brain changes and if so whether that leads
to any impairment the current work doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: determine whether casual to moderate
marijuana use is harmful to the brain she
[SPEAKER_03]: said so we can see changes but we don't
know if it's harmful yet casual to
[SPEAKER_04]: moderate I would say maybe maybe you
really got high four times a week that
[SPEAKER_04]: would be casual to moderate to me you know
I'm saying like somebody had it like you
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't buy weed or anything like that or
any just when somebody had it like hey you
[SPEAKER_04]: know and you smoked what they had that
would be that would be acceptable to
[SPEAKER_04]: casual moderate to me anything besides
that you're a user and you you use it to
[SPEAKER_04]: get that that chemical change you know I
mean I dude I don't we have
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah that's true that's true if I smoke
some sour diesel I can't sit down like
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll think I'm gonna smoke a bowl and
watch a movie or something I'll smoke some
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel and end up doing the damn dishes I
feel like that with pretty much anything I
[SPEAKER_04]: feel like gets me high though I mean soon
as I get high I get motivated I mean I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not that lazy stoner you know like that's
why we're all three here though there are
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of people that are not here
because they're I'm sure you like to be
[SPEAKER_05]: well that way it gets you you're not
sidetracked with this you're focusing on
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing at a time you know I feel that
same way doing construction and stuff down
[SPEAKER_05]: there in Florida man we fucking baked all
day fuck you superintendent you're sitting
[SPEAKER_05]: in your truck while I'm blowing down
setting trusses what are you gonna do
[SPEAKER_05]: climb up here and get me fat boy down
there for a reason it was it I've never
[SPEAKER_04]: been that type of person to really smoke
and be unmotivated you know like I could
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely see it you know if it's just me
and her sitting around the house and we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have anything to do yeah yeah yeah
but it doesn't ruin your motivation no no
[SPEAKER_03]: all right well they continue to say the
effects of marijuana can occur much
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier than previously thought some of
the effect may depend on a person to age
[SPEAKER_03]: when marijuana use starts you said another
brain researcher of the state of
[SPEAKER_03]: University of Wisconsin Milwaukee that's
odd it said just one new state Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_03]: Milwaukee no okay sorry I'm dabbed I don't
know it's just all one word I am she said
[SPEAKER_03]: her own work has found similar results I
think the clear message is we see brain
[SPEAKER_03]: alterations before you develop dependence
so that says that your brain is starting
[SPEAKER_03]: to change before we notice that we're
craving some tabs again I don't know how
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys feel about that article some of
it seemed I don't feel like as a kid when
[SPEAKER_04]: I was young getting high it was it was
like I need to get high it was all along
[SPEAKER_05]: the lines of when I could get it and when
came around you know I'm talking about 16
[SPEAKER_05]: 17 living in Gainesville Florida like it
was everywhere but it still wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere for a 17 year old you know you
had to have your skate rat friends that
[SPEAKER_05]: you know older brother that one guy that
knew that that would actually sell to a
[SPEAKER_05]: teenager you know I'm saying I mean it's I
don't know I mean that was years and years
[SPEAKER_03]: and years ago but that's the way it was
back then so glad that I grew up in
[SPEAKER_03]: California to where there's just always
somewhere and then I moved to Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: right at the right time well I've been
here for 20 years now but I mean it was
[SPEAKER_05]: the right time I got a buddy that lives in
California he's always like yeah he
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't even know he's my age and he's
never and he's like dude we smoke we blow
[SPEAKER_05]: all the time he's like what does the cop
gonna do he's gonna roll up tells put it
[SPEAKER_05]: out he's probably gonna write one of us a
ticket whoever's holding it yeah maybe the
[SPEAKER_04]: end of it maybe end of it yep and I'm like
well fuck you you know I'm still like
[SPEAKER_05]: still puffing in the corner yeah no no I
can't dude it's it's still there and I
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like it's gonna be there for a while
it's just something that I've grown up
[SPEAKER_05]: with I mean it's great that I can sit in
my home and feel comfortable or well you
[SPEAKER_05]: could tell the new Senate bills yeah right
or drive from point A to point B and not
[SPEAKER_05]: worried about getting pulled over and like
yeah that's one of the best parts is yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the rate my dad rig in the car
and I'm cruising I think it's pretty funny
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes um I just forget you know I'm
like oh man a few months ago or a couple
