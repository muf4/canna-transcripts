[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just smoking some Yeti.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Started the podcast off a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's tradition over here,
but I think we kind of went a little extra
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys said you wanted to go hard on the
dabs and we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing Maddie said when she
walked into the house was, I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got two so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need another one, dude,
there's dabs over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hot, I've got the email on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Giddy up and Emotech for the
Gmail we keep it on most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was complimenting the USB port that he
installed into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that dope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Charge your phone all the time while
you're taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Instagram and on Instagram,
you charge the phone, take dabs and be on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're doing over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of questions for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to be a part of this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wake up, Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and drag the chair on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scraping around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this headphone mic is fucking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever buy the live wire solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: H.A.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Negative shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hate that piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craps out on us a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were saying that Maddie was going to
be the first female on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that's inaccurate because I took
the podcast to the Brickyard one time and
[SPEAKER_01]: we had.
[SPEAKER_06]: You made me feel special for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be special in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'm going to skip bragging on the
other people that were.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other females, but you're the
first female to be here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went somewhere else and there were
females there that were on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're the first lady to come be in
the Irish studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Spencer the first black person on the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: Spencer's probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always the first black person in
anything Jeff does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's the first black person in my
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, shout out to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in a bad way, though, just
coincidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's any other black people around
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in fucking Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of white people and a
lot of Mexicans here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's just where we live.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supposed to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows I'm in Pueblo by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys came in to visit me.

[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to help.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to help people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm learning a lot from it, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot more than I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have my friends working at
hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go in there, you don't try to
hustle me and sell me some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely think Hygro Pueblo has the
best prices in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if you listen to the I Grow
Culture or the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, we're changing the name,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stutter and say the wrong
name a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll remind you about that later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go in there and you tell me,
listen to this podcast, you will get
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial pricing on everything you buy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie didn't know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going, I might have to learn how to
work the cash register.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not do any more commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else that paid for ads,
you'll get them some other time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do also a shout out to Miss
Decroots for letting me play their music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me play all of their music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give me full access to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's usually that costs a lot of
money for a bandit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Peaches or Pears?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Pears.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Pears.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff is in on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Big Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you were here with the crew,
but someone's got to take care of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Sirocco Nana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scratches on the head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, when is this posted?
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven ten in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got people asking me already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys are following everybody on
Instagram and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, dude, we just took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only give Spencer a huge shout out on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence taught me how to make my own dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to learn from one of who I
consider the masters and also a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's about time you have great
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in turn, that's going to make great
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to brag on Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell a story about Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie and Spence hang out together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I met them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one time Spence made Earl and Maddie
She's grinning already.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She took that Pyrex dish that had a little
bit of BHO left in the bottom that we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't feel like scraping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she decided to heat it up and make
brownies in that pan with the BHO mix in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's laughing because Spence and I
are on the six four six five level of
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to 200 pounds each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was another guy and another guy
in the room that's about the same weight
[SPEAKER_01]: class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she fucking wrecked four dudes,
maybe five or six dudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't even know that it was going
to be that potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole outer layer of the brownie was
literally covered in a layer of shatter
[SPEAKER_06]: almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it coated inside of the brownie,
but it worked itself in perfectly to where
[SPEAKER_06]: it got us all so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made like a it was like a pineapple
upside down cake layer of hash on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so it was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But God, I was high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to leave about 30 minutes after I
left or ate that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt my arms drooping and I was like,
I got to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody went to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back in the day, that was the only
way I could really utilize a Pyrex dish
[SPEAKER_06]: without wasting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said back in the day, I'm going to
ask a tech question now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely do not blast into a Pyrex dish
or use a Pyrex dish in our process anymore
[SPEAKER_06]: at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's closed loop and use parchment
when we process it to go through the back
[SPEAKER_06]: of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no Pyrex dish needed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys taught me a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no Pyrex dish involved in how I
was taught, which is kind of neat,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are fucking bad ass at what
they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming, you guys,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence was like, what are we going to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was he kind of said, let's do a year
in review.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that would be kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that stood out to me is you
got super fucking sick at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You back you like 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you 95?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look good, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gaining on my weight back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I lost a bunch of weight and being
skinny and losing a bunch of weight ain't
[SPEAKER_03]: really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you looked you looked anorexic and
scary skinny for a minute there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had everybody worried.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we realized in 2014 health is one
of the most important things that we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking care of our bodies is really sorry
where it should happen on the computer
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're recording.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care of our bodies is really
important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with him getting so sick now,
we're trying to get him back together and
[SPEAKER_06]: get him healthy and gaining some more
weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eating properly is one thing we've kind of
clicked into doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you guys taking great care of
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to the gym too now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this will be Spencer's first time
going to the gym today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't talk about me like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I got them long spaghetti arms and
spaghetti legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how it feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go exercise in front of
anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a plan of fitness, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: They accept everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it's in our location.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of large people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure you guys don't even look that
silly there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking good at the gym.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to look like an Olympic athlete
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both like, damn, he's in the NBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you're the only black person around
here, if you go by the college.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not a lot of black folk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should wear your grill to the gym and
just go hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go hard all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stun on him at the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lost your grill?
[SPEAKER_06]: He loses it on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just misplaced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a different shelf for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a different pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're back to health,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot to mention, Maddie grew my
Girl Scout cookies times King Kim Grape
[SPEAKER_01]: Stomper O G-Cross, and it looked
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had two different phenos.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had four plants altogether, but two
phenos of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one got huge and the nodes were really
far away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally different color.
[SPEAKER_06]: The smaller plant, the other phenom turned
purple at the end of flower, but was super
[SPEAKER_06]: frosty.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one wasn't as frosty,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that thing is ever going
to get to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might just be something that
the crew around here gets to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you did a good job with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the owner to say that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a year in review, both of you guys
are involved in these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can both have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take turns.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of your favorite strains to
grow since we're all growers in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might answer on some of these
questions too, since we'll do a year in
[SPEAKER_01]: review.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at the beginning of the year,
I was still stuck on the whole Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_03]: cookie thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything Girl Scout cookies, I was kind of
running through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still currently still have a lot of
different unique cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I grew that Yeti OG and that kind of
put me onto the OG side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I've been kind of trekking and
trying to find different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up triangles the other day,
so that's another good one to have around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd probably say Yeti is probably my
favorite plant of the year to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say that's the one Jesse
found for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's your favorite oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of my favorite oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my follow up questions was
going to be, do you prefer to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff for oil if you're going to
smoke it for flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow it for yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow a different strain and then
grow different for Earl?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times, oil is just depending on
what we have available at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have certain strains that we know
that are better in oil than they are in
[SPEAKER_03]: flour, we'll make oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then same like we have Kanatonic right
now, which we're going to split and do
[SPEAKER_03]: some oil and then some capsules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit of mix of- Oh
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I feel real high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also gave me two of those hash
capsules right before we started the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've done a lot of- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be pretty lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it in my eyes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, why am I getting heavy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kanatonic, is that the super high CBD
strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a crazy high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 3 to 1 THC or CBD to THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice and- Great medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll make great medicine for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to take it to, do you have a
specific patient in mind or a type of
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, like an epileptic or someone with
MS or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of people who are also
like cancer patients that I want to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: get some stuff to and see if, you know,
just, it's not going to hurt to give it a
[SPEAKER_03]: try, especially when it's, you know,
you're fighting cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might as well try all you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool that you guys help people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys came from North Carolina and
set up shop in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they give away a lot of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people to be able to move out of,
from out of state and do that is really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there are a lot of people that are
really stingy with what they grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just love to share with other people
and show people what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you guys are so well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you share and you're super kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think why we moved from North Carolina
is cause I wanted to, when I lived in
[SPEAKER_03]: North Carolina, I wanted to tell everybody
I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was illegal, but I was like,
yo, come look at this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'd crack the door open and people
would be like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: People think there is a UFO in our closet
or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then now when you're here, you know,
there's so many people that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you, you do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, let me see your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, you know, everything's
common.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, one thing I do wish, I do wish the
barter system was pot was a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: better because it would take money out of
the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could just go to the restaurant and
pay for it in an eighth, I know a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of places you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to dinner one night here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, it's the best breakfast
you can ever have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matthew, what was your, some, some of your
favorite shit to grow this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who it's from, but there was
a New York city, diesel, phenom we had and
[SPEAKER_06]: it tastes like, and smells like red wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had put it in this big circle jar
and all of our friends, including me,
[SPEAKER_06]: would just literally stick their faces in
it for hours and just You had to mix it
[SPEAKER_06]: with something else to kind of dial it
down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then definitely at the end of the
year, one of my last favorites is a
[SPEAKER_06]: tangerine haze times the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just found out that I have two
packages of that in my little vault and
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit is going to be ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're looking at me like,
well, let's you run it and give me clones
[SPEAKER_01]: of the keeper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, we were in the middle of a
process where we didn't know what we were
[SPEAKER_06]: doing with our garden or if we were
relocating.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I decided not to take clones of it,
which was a huge mistake because I had a
[SPEAKER_06]: pheno that was heavier in the white.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a really good flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The oil, of course, is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tangerine oil tastes crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave me a couple of dabs of this
tangerine oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you, I've got two packs of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a pack, maybe both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You run them and you find that tangerine
pheno and then you give me a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that'll be a good trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a keeper out of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice tangerine flavored one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe I'll breed to that
tangerine flavored female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you said that because that was
definitely one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from a down with dirt seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Riley.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great strain, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually if you breed to the white,
it either comes out nothing, like you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get any flavor or you get all that
dank.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I had one pheno that came out
a really strong white flavor and the
[SPEAKER_06]: tangerine was still there, but it was
definitely a back note to it, which was
[SPEAKER_06]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you were giving me dabs of was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, y'all got some more of those
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, bye Felicia.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really have any left at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's sad and concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good dabs go away quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to conserve what I made
and it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to dab the shit out of my dabs
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to take a dab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep saying the D word so many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to take a dab of?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the Yeti OG over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little bit of live that I got
from my good friend Spence a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the gorilla haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've also got some some of the
shatter that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's parchment paper, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine the size of parchment that it
takes to make that sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty big rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a nice piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, you got that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicely medicated, highly educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next question that I want to talk about
for the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might mention a couple of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to talk about my own
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should, but that feels lemon Jeffery,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you grow anything that you... There's
a few strains you grew this year that you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't...
[SPEAKER_03]: That white widow that I got from Spence
was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the platinum emoji.
[SPEAKER_03]: The platinum emoji is pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some of it over there in a jar
curing still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the glue came around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody's impressed with what it
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to grow that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took cuts to grow it again a couple more
times because I definitely want to put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bigger pot and give it more love,
more training, more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you grow the gorilla glue,
feed the shit out of that plant early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it's hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just overfeed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you're going to fuck it up in
week four, feed it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just feed it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's got to say something,
so I'll ask a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of your biggest growing
evolutions?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorites is lemon Jeffery,
the white widow, and the gorilla glue,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll settle on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Yeti, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of your favorite,
biggest growing evolutions that you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: made at the Garden of Weed in this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of know what you're going to
say, and I'm going to give a shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody after you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cage thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, we kind of changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with, you know, stuff changing and
like regulation and laws and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you kind of got to change with the
game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're kind of instead of doing a
room full of multiple plants, we're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: less plants, same space, but just bigger,
longer veg plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really get to take care of a lot of,
you know, get to spend more time with each
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, work on canopy management,
you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out right there on my paper
brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I knew that's where this
conversation was headed.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have really set up an awesome plan
for their grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people are catching on to
what they're doing, because with the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: count now, we have to do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So bigger is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as a breeder, it's scary to see
these plant count limitations come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily, I just teamed up with the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to do some breeding in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are those cages pretty much your
biggest evolution of growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we kind of learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a lot of tea stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You advanced your teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the alfalfa sprouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some shit like that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we do this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the barley straw that has like
natural barley, barley seeds and it grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a lot of stuff with the Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grokashi like that was a big hit this
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of Grokashi is a big hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just kind of going back a lot of
going back to the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and then everybody went to Gavitas and
Nanowases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking about the light that
Jesse gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not even be able to run it,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grow room's got like a seven foot
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow my plants to usually five and a
half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been told that you got to keep
the plants three feet from those lights or
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll burn them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say you will burn them,
because there's probably a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that could grow closer than three
feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just think they would definitely
stresses them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too much spectrum and too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've never been under Gavitas or
anything like that, you know how powerful
[SPEAKER_03]: they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just hired me at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 227 Gavitas and they turn on a
small portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, it's like you just
woke up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they about to buy you Method 7?
[SPEAKER_01]: Method 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Method 7?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are listening, I could use a
sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they about to buy you at the spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they said they would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, still, if I can get them on
the DL from the discount or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to cop up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Harvest Honey, hit up Harvest
Honey, she'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Harvest Honey, I don't mean to bust
you out on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I do, because she's trying to be
Miss High Time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check her out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't say vote for her,
but check her out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give her a good run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just at Greenworks on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to search right quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the guys that kind of inspired the
idea for Spence's cages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Single plant Scroggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single plant, yeah, single plant Scroggs
in gigantic containers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you tell them how we switched ours
up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, ours are mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to tell people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Garden of Weed on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just instead of using the big
squares.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to copy my man shit from.
[SPEAKER_03]: We switched ours up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had to be a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do your own OG status.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the plug on the Scroggs,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is green underscore works underscore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have an awesome feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make sure you follow Garden of Weed
and don't follow one of the fake Garden of
[SPEAKER_01]: Weedens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for pictures of these folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't follow the bunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of the bunk Garden of
Weedens and they always send me messages
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit and I don't reply because I don't
want to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just ignore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure that you find a picture of
Spence is a six foot, six foot four,
[SPEAKER_01]: six foot five black guy with a beard and
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if there's not pictures of that
dude on there, don't follow that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Maddie's a pretty lady and
they're standing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it's easy to spot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably hitting at an expensive
rig or taking too big of a dab in the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have an expensive rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least we know we worked hard for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying you guys are always at the
end, not just your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are all the cool events and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so lucky we have so many friends
with awesome toys that we get to play with
[SPEAKER_06]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This industry is so great when you make
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this community slash industry,
you get to hit so many cool rigs and smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's your little master shake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's up on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good competition there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Shake against the rig that Spence
brought over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who made that rig you brought?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know his name, but it's B.C.
Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a Quave Club Brian something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, with a banger on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that thing kicks you right in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right in the dick and smiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at you like, you should name it
Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the guy from The Simpsons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: They should name it Nelson because it's
just like hits you and just kicks you
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the dick and laughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great rig, but I'm kind of offended
by the way it hit me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to look at it a second time and
reconsider if I wanted to hit it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wanted to hit it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will hit it again, but got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked kind of about growing
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't change too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning more about breeding and I
learned that one of the methods I tried,
[SPEAKER_01]: I over did it and I don't need to apply so
damn much because it fucked up my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to I make my own silver
thiosulfate and I applied way too many
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned that if you overdo it,
it just pisses plants off and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get enough pollen and it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my growing evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did you guys notice this year other
than Greenworks who stood out in the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: community?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk about good and or bad stuff
because you covered your face like you
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking were like, well, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give a shout out to like all the
people that are, you know, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: going away from bottle nutrients,
but people who are, you know, expanding
[SPEAKER_03]: their grow game into biologicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually just in Denver on Monday
and I got to meet up with the micro fusion
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some bags of micro fusion for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice shit rocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then shout out to the Mills guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always hooking me up when I see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you look like you're impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just started and honestly, we're really
impressed so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you use it back in the day too one
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I used, what was that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your homies used it on Instagram,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to follow somebody that talked
about Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are still talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's doing something right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a friend in Seattle that started
using it and she raved about it for
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her plants were beautiful too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she is all about Mills.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when he started talking about it,
well, I talked to her a little bit about
[SPEAKER_06]: it and she said it was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went ahead and got samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we met them and we,
they teamed up with micro fusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing something together now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's biologicals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their line is now teamed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have their whole feeding chart
with the micro fusion mixed in also.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these days soon, we're going to
make a field trip, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be Spence and Jesse and
myself and Maddie, you can come too if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go to the Worm Company in
Springs, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[SPEAKER_01]: and go visit Jay and stock up on some
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some worm poop.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about to cross somebody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing fucking basketball in my
back, in my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the organic growers like Probiotics
Farmers Alliance, those types of guys who
[SPEAKER_01]: were shot, who were shot out for who we
noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also noticed on a lot in Colorado,
this year, Miss Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know her personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we haven't met her yet, but we
haven't met her yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is doing some great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Jess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Jess, Miss Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met her one time on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a beer rig and I had,
you know, the purple one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was sitting across the table dabbing
and I had my shirt on and she complimented
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you want to hit it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she goes, you're that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I am, because she
recognized me from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's awesome is everybody at the Secret
Cup a lot of people had ran her,
[SPEAKER_06]: her Kong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Miss Green Thumb on Instagram
and check out her Kong on her feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so awesome when everyone's saying
compliments to the grower, Miss Green
[SPEAKER_06]: Thumb.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she got a lot of recognition for her,
for her work this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So compliments to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She grew arms the size of my, or buds the
size of my arms.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and her are probably some of the,
are the two best female growers that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a hell of a compliment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can get her on the podcast one
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told her she can come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people live in Denver and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to drive down to this town
to be on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, the dangerous city in the
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably been like fucking 10 years
in a row though.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so frustrating though, because it's
not like every day there's just violent
[SPEAKER_06]: crimes right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the people that other people are
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mind my own business and I don't have
any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess since we're talking about
fucking the town and stuff that we see,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: After seeing, it's been a full year of
legalization, like a year and five days
[SPEAKER_01]: now, since we've legalized recreational
adult use cannabis in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the moment that you could buy a
weed at a store in Colorado, but like
[SPEAKER_01]: after this full year, how do you feel
about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what have you seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it make a difference?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are from a whole other state.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's legal, so they have to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the regulations are shitty,
but it's stuff that has to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the country wants to use Colorado or
Washington as an example to go legal
[SPEAKER_03]: across the board, it's going to have to be
regulated like it if it wants to be
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks for small people like myself,
who are small business, mom and pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to be small business and it
kind of got squished.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always remember, go to the mom and pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always find better stuff there than
you will the big store, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the spot first.
[SPEAKER_03]: The spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do what I got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matty, what did you notice over the last
year?
[SPEAKER_06]: So many people from out of state are
flooding into Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say anything negative about that
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't say much because we moved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I moved here two years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not being hateful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just noticing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in February two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's North Carolina and Texas that have
moved here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just because you know us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only reason North Carolina is
because we are all from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you brought the town of Dixie with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixie is empty now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just dust and fucking tumbleweeds in
Dixie because you all left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of our friends though learned how
to grow amazing weed this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our friends really caught on
quickly and learned a lot from us and also
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Instagram is not only a social
network, a great media to learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your guys' table at the new and the old
house is part of what started me thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about I should do something because I
would go to your place and guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's Spence and Maddie's old place and the
new place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people would fly from North Carolina
and come visit these guys and just hang
[SPEAKER_01]: out for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I would show up to come dab them
out and kind of maybe give them some iry
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and a t-shirt and some stickers for
visiting and maybe a hat pin, they would
[SPEAKER_01]: start asking weed questions and no shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten guys came and nine of them asked the
same exact first three questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I should just record this
somewhere and play it back at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like here is my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an automated weed service or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got good at talking to people at the
table and talking about growing weed like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your guys' table kind of opened
this up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our table is a hot topic because we're
always just taking dabs and talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: different growing subjects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's always so many different
people there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always something to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a crazy mix of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black guy, Mexican guy, white guy,
Persian girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's an Asian guy from his
Vietnamese dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he got a couple of white dudes,
a couple chihuahuas, people that I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: even tell what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm my wook ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice mix of people over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just flood in when there's legal
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: We come from a place where you can't have
more than a gram on you without possibly
[SPEAKER_06]: going to jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you get a citation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if it's under an eighth or half
eighth or something like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's more, you have the possibility
of going to jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still real in places here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so free.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going home at the end of the month
and so most nerve wracking because we
[SPEAKER_06]: can't be ourselves there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so used to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's so easy going and free.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm staying inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: People forget that there's an open
container law that applies to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to have your weed in a
container that's sealed up and out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably supposed to be in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I've got an SUV so my trunk,
I can reach the trunk in my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can reach everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking 6'5 and I have an SUV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so no matter where I put it,
so I put it in the backpack in a container
[SPEAKER_01]: and my dabs are always out of reach and in
the back seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's how I roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there may have been car dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be a smart ass and ask why he
had to know what time it was, but none of
[SPEAKER_01]: my jokes are going to be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're going to get swole up tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get blazed and you'll work your shit
heavier when you're high though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't going to lift too much today.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know what you're going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to run a mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 30 minutes later, what are you going
to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Spencer quit smoking cigarettes this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good change for the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Team Weedon all quit smoking cigarettes
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When everybody got sick, everybody got
like deathly ill at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you guys all were like,
fuck cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he came back strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a big accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely dabs taste good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely different once you get your
full pallet back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still haven't gotten my full one back,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spencer used to smoke Newport's.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it'll come back within
like two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll shout out to Newport.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got me through some years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through some stressful times.
[SPEAKER_03]: My life is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only black person in this town and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we didn't see after
legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bunch of crime, a whole bunch of
murder, a whole bunch of rape,
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole bunch of little kids running
around smoking spliffs, a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: people walking in the park just getting
high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is there to fight over when it's
legal?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the no brainer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't understand why other states
don't follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hear that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie's got a point, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in another state, fucking
legalize weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize cannabis around the country would
make things so much easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to lower crime and have less
people in jail for pointless crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make some money off of cannabis taxes,
because the state of Colorado makes a shit
[SPEAKER_01]: ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could Google it, but that'll give me
sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a whole shit ton of money off
legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just released everything since it's
2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably try to do that on episode 49
or 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get Mike here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's good with numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make it sound eloquent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been working hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Adam, Jesse, that whole crew,
Tony?
[SPEAKER_01]: They all been working their asses off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting some shit done.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I supposed to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish, cut faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I'm supposed to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They listen to the podcast at the work
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish, do something, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking do something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play Xbox later, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So full year of legalization and nobody's
been fucking raped and killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No kids with joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's my next question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Garden of Weedon, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys won a bunch of awards this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your proudest
achievements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I just got deep on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to go through a lot of hardships
this year, so definitely getting our win
[SPEAKER_06]: for Secret Cut Mountain was awesome for
us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pulling everything together and getting
our entry right and perfecting live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you'd consider it
perfecting, but working on... We just got
[SPEAKER_01]: really good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are part of the pioneering
process of live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to perfect live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, what I've been dabbing, I call it
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit's good enough, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was so awesome to win the Secret
Cut because we were with all of our
[SPEAKER_06]: friends and it was an awesome competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty fair in my opinion because you
have, for if anybody doesn't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have a box with... How many entries
were there this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there were 32 maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 something.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just cool because you get to compete
with, especially Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado's like...
[SPEAKER_03]: The first place to do weed stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you got... It's supposed to be like
the Mecca of oil makers, so it's cool to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to win that or win it for Colorado and
compete against people who... Cushy Candy
[SPEAKER_03]: just won the Amsterdam Cup with the Kong.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was standing there, I was standing
next to my girl and they're like... When
[SPEAKER_01]: Big D announced it, he goes like,
you all know who won first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know who it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel dumb because I was like,
well...
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, then that made me think,
well, obviously it's not Spence because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's something that would be... It's going
to be one of those popular guys that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: stickers everywhere and fucking everyone
knows him and they were all high fiving
[SPEAKER_01]: him as he walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I didn't fucking see Bomb
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he's like, fucking Garden of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I could say was, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just looked at my girl like,
did... Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys walked up to the front and
she's like, shouldn't you go up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, let my homie have his
minute for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone in the crowd is looking
at me like, they moved out of my way so
[SPEAKER_01]: that I could walk up towards you guys and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, I'll just go hang
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so shocked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea we were going to win.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they called three and two,
I was like, fuck, we have lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and Maddie were literally standing
right next to each other and they did like
[SPEAKER_03]: all the bottom awards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bottom, but like... Most turfs,
kind of sewer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't win none of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they did third place and it
was... Who was third place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind Bill?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind Bill was third place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then second place was Cushy Candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I looked at Maddie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, we ain't winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he went through that whole round
when I was like, damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look on your face was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were kind of in shock for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Maddie was... Since we were so
shocked, he didn't even know what to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he just had to, you know... His speech
was great though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something about running from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I moved here to do this and I did
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part about it is we had all of
our friends pretty much from North
[SPEAKER_06]: Carolina were at the event with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the best thing is to win with the
people beside you that you started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people thought that I grew that
material and I had to correct a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them because Spence was wearing his Irie
Genetics hoodie and so was Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just rocked that shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so comfy, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some great hoodies.
[SPEAKER_06]: The logo is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's in the washer right now though,
getting cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two of them because I got the dog
hair situation going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the dogs, Siroc.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the loving.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Jerry boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you listening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stella, are you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, proudest achievements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, winning that secret cup,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the other stuff you guys keep
winning on Thursday nights?
[SPEAKER_03]: We won Top Shelf Thursday in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's multiple social clubs in Denver
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're ever bored and you want to go
smoke somewhere, just drive to Denver and
[SPEAKER_03]: Google social smoke club.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one particular is in Aurora.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one's in Aurora off of Colfax.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called 710 Social Lounge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Ink Therapy either one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to try to remember those.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can pay like a member price.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pay like 25 bucks and then you can go
in there for any time you want for a month
[SPEAKER_03]: and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last month they did or last time they did
a 16 person bracket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it broke all the way down to the
finals and then I won the finals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a free rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a bunch of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're doing another round and now
it's 32 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a bigger bracket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted me to do it, but I want to
focus more on growing weed this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still make oil, but I want to focus
on making sure my weeds at where it should
[SPEAKER_03]: be at before I even make oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see, that's why I wasn't even making
oil before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to breed and make sure that shit
was on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do that and let you hash makers make
my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was working well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a lot of fun making a hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one thing with all these competitions
this year also, we met a lot of amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: people in Denver specifically,
because when we used to go to Denver,
[SPEAKER_06]: we used to not really know that many
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we started going to the
social club, we kind of connected with a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are new to Colorado,
that's a good opportunity to meet a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: other fellow dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even if you're just somebody that's in
the 710 or 420 community and you're from
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado and you want other people to
smoke with, feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find us at, I'll be at the Cannabis Cup
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really rep the high times events,
but I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the high times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's April 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the 18th, 19th and 20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's three days this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of dope ass events planned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not have a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was offered a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I declined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather roam around and do a Task Rock
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just take my backpack and do what I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'll go quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more fun that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I feel tied down when I have a
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can walk around and go see who I want to
and then get the fuck out when I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then actually enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a booth in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to invest into that and be
tied down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to have some employees that'll run
the booth the whole time for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want before I'm there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking forward to me having
a booth at the cup, I apologize,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm really tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really white and I got really long
dreadlocks and I'm wearing an iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt and or hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ain't gonna miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's next for the Garden of Weeding,
you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean like the gym after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, 2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spencer just said focus on growing and get
back to the basics and really work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, particularly lately we've been
working on our veg, just getting our veg
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just making sure all of our stuff is
top of the line, getting all of our
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment in check.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just... For your new growers,
did you hear what Maddie just said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't pay enough attention to
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scolding any of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying a lot of people don't pay
enough attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not you specifically, not you,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't pay enough attention to
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pay more, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that veg room as much as you love the
flower room because that's where it all
[SPEAKER_01]: starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy children make healthy adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you neglect your kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't expect your flower plants to be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have a shitty veg.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes even us, we sometimes start
to get so caught up in our flower room
[SPEAKER_06]: that, like I said, our veg started falling
behind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to work on just making sure
all of our garden is in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: In check.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a nice team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how you guys can handle shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, we got to do something.
Squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squat stands up and it happens,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fucking awesome to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a big mic and he's our other part
of solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me Big Mike 919 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of our good homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aka Barack Oganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rocking Nana's bodyguard.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come be on the podcast whenever
you want, bro, but we're going to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike isn't into the giant dab thing like
we are over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glob squad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glob squad.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, sloppy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't heard from me in a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have your new phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my excuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't because I'm texting the
old phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently I didn't know you had a new
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder who I'm texting because they
shouldn't get those messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dead phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got anything left for the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going like 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should start winking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do that part?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go find that on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence is thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think too hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have just put the seeds that I
germinated of the lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate when I say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have that conversation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon J, KCGS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you guys are, when we're talking,
this is just random side talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about strains,
a lot of times people, and I tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid it also, but so many people said it
that I got sucked into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will say the lemon Jeff
times the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to say crossed two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me that it's at I grow culture,
which I wish I could change that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show name is different and I don't
want to lose all my Twitter followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what we could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make a new one and then add the link
to that one in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just double click.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how should we say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what does that X mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not math.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, personally, like when I just said
it, it's a two times two would make the
[SPEAKER_01]: four.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we, if you, if two bone two,
it would have four was what would come
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so still though, I just don't,
I mean, it technically could be right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me personally, I just think when it comes
out of my mouth, it just does not sound
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're not doing math.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the new one?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come up with something in the next
30 seconds, I'll give you the opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to create a new term.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can think of something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get like phone a friend or
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a dab alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how long you get to think it
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to get this dab alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resin for you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I'm going to have you come on the
show until the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't afford that money for that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just beatbox it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have to, that's why I was cutting
her off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it over her.
[SPEAKER_03]: We said that that one was cool,
but just to not, we're not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: all, it doesn't beat times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that when I talk like it,
the cannabis cup to people, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be offended.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people might like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And F is for finial for a generational
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Maddie, I'll let you take the
dab and we'll let you try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to let her.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chick takes big dads, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie takes bigger dads than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the garden, we didn't get weeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you're blowing out a fat dab and
staring off into the sky, what's the new
[SPEAKER_01]: word?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody else can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're the one that you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're the one protesting, you should
find a solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we, can we, you want me to pause and
let you take a drink and cope with life
[SPEAKER_01]: for a minute?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we, can I think about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: In the next podcast, we can come back with
something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, do you guys want to be on episode
number 50?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to get you two and Adam and
Jesse and Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can fit that many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go buy some mics and then return them
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the shit your black friends will
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I want to give you guys a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were on time as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's only because I dragged him out of
the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know your house is that close to Amy's
donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Amy's donuts on the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Amy's donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a stomach ache and a toothache,
both from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this nigga Michael made salmon with
wild rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tried to tell me that wild rice ain't
rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, bro, why the fuck they call it
wild rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he made, what kind of carrots he
made?
[SPEAKER_03]: Glazed carrots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glazed carrots with lemon and some
portobello mushrooms sauteed with spinach.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spencer's reply when it all got sat down
was, this is some white people shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I bet you ate it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate the salmon, the rice, and then the
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got us here on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is, if I'm going to
double up if I play the garden of Weedon
[SPEAKER_01]: song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have some other shit
playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to play two songs at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm glad I checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm learning, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't going to double up on two songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been awkward sounding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucked everyone's heads all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to start wrapping
up this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go, I do want to say a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I want to thank you guys for
coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an awesome podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem happened to be the first girl
on the, or the first woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first woman credit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first woman on the show at your
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Spencer's looking at the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some lemon Jeffrey over there in
the jar that I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some platinum OGs, some Girl Scout
cookies, some Grateful Dog and some lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a peek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell what it is from that angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Grateful Dog, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crack it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crack and Nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk while he does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me remind you guys of a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am changing the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get sued by that other
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I could use a new logo, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to sue you, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's my fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: That weed's about to fall out there,
but it's so sticky it won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I stole somebody's name on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it, but they got all
popular and now they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could use a logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep asking for a new song.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep playing that song from
the Mystic Roots Band and other Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band songs because they said I could
and they're free and I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm canceling the Instagram for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be an I Grow Culture podcast
Instagram, but the I Read Genetics one
[SPEAKER_01]: will exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to leave it up for a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave it up so you can go steal all
the pictures or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Links.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just start posting those pictures to
the I Read Genetics Instagram and have one
[SPEAKER_01]: feed instead of having two feeds I'm
trying to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds like a bunch of
bitching, but it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably cancel the YouTube for
the podcast also and just keep the and
[SPEAKER_01]: start doing something with the I Read
Genetics YouTube or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so much goddamn media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't keep up and I want to focus on
doing a good podcast is really what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to email me, you can use
I Grow Culture at Hotmail.com or Grow From
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Heart at Hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I check them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 50 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Spence will make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Maddie will make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have Jesse, hopefully, trying to get
Mike, trying to get Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are invited if you're listening,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make Jesse come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, Adam, Mike, Maddie, Spence,
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might fill this little space we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have to fucking go.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be hotboxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So episode 50 will be a small celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse teased that he would have some
prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have at least an I Read
Genetics t-shirt or three to give away
[SPEAKER_01]: like a hat pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got any prizes or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some Garden of Whedon prizes
coming on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll leave it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Random prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's kind of what I'm doing,
too, until I run downstairs and check the
[SPEAKER_01]: little box that I've been throwing shit
into a pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want to dedicate too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when episode 50 comes, Jesse promised
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's up, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening, episode 50 is in like
a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I want you to message me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you learned on the
podcast, because we want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: that on episode 50 and recap for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we did the year in review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to know your what you
learned from the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know your favorite guests were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just listed them right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking Spencer, Jesse,
Mike, Adam, Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else has been on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sean got the most listens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean definitely got the most listens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to come be on episode 50,
you can, bro, but it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd kind of rather reserve your knowledge
for when it's just you and I face to face
[SPEAKER_01]: because you fucking school me and it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, guys, if there's somebody around here
you'd like to have on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to reach out to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have something you want me to ask
other people and you have some ideas,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you like, get this person on,
back that up with a like and ask them
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll do that because that will help me
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn off your mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say now that now I can now
you can nobody can hear you now,
[SPEAKER_01]: so go for it.

that idea.

[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a new Twitter page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's something that's grown
from your heart somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to fucking try to sue me for
that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's what we're going to do.
