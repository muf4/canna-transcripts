[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Episode 349 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fancy intro music today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just throws off my rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes it gets me messed up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a copyright notification,
so I don't want to mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to get right to the podcast
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got some fun stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show by
letting you know what I am smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of the coffee
nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this one on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that dark roast coffee flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a delicious aftertaste,
and it's got a great high that just makes
[SPEAKER_00]: me nice and mellow, nice and chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high feels like it's settled in right
above my eyes, kind of on my eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting pressure on my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I got some weight on my
forehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a super mellow high to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm smoking on the coffee nectar from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some of you have noticed that my
voice sounds a little bit funky for this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I had way too much fun
seeing fish for three days this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hyping it up on the podcast for
a few weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish, my favorite band, was in town for
three nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were here Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were actually in Denver or Commerce
City, to be more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only about 130 miles from home,
so that's a super easy three-day adventure
[SPEAKER_00]: for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people travel across the country
to go see fish, so just 100 miles is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: big deal to go see this band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have traveled all over the place to go
see fish in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to pack up the old Ford Contour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob the dude and myself would get in the
car and just go drive across the country
[SPEAKER_00]: and just learn about life and experience
the world and see fish every night,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then camp out or get a filthy hotel
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then wake up the next day, drive to the
next show, and do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd do it all summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we did it all fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time, fish would just come
straight through Colorado in the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we'd just catch them on that November
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But summer tour, oh man, we would pack up
the car and just go for a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year, I headed up to Denver on
Friday, got to see fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super easy getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parking was super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got in, got to have a good time on the
parking lot, got to take some dabs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, got in, got to see the show,
got to sit with some of our friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks for the show, so that's always
a good time hanging out with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to hang out and enjoy the fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played a bunch of great songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys probably don't want to hear about
the song titles and stuff, and if you care
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, you've probably already seen the
set list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, shout out to my friends from
ComedyWorks for hanging out on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second night, I went back.
[SPEAKER_00]: to that area looking to see if I could see
some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed some seats with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got too crowded right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to boogie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were playing really good songs that
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a different sound that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not uncommon for fish to have a
different sound every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of have a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out with different energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get down and dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of loosened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was enjoying my weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided that I was going to abandon
the pretty good seats that I had with some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, and I was going to go find some
space by myself to where I could stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: my long hippie arms out and dance a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found a section where there weren't
any people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were just no people there,
and I kind of went there and kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: started grooving and seeing if anybody
would kick me out, and nobody said
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about me standing in this big
empty aisle area just dancing like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just spinning around dancing,
and next thing I know, a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies have gathered around, and we're
all just having a good time right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So section 104 became kind of a little
dance party up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to be down in the front where the
band is real loud and all the energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: down there, but it's a little crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a big dude, and I got long-ass
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spilling people's beer with my dreads
and shit, and people are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated at how tall I am, and I want to
dance like a wook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to the back and had a really
good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunday night, I decided to go back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why waste time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went right back to where I knew there
was a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to fight for a seat because
it's just standing space right there
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, so you can go in late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go in right before the show
starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go grab a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get comfortable right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke a little bit and have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found that spot and made some new
friends there and had a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fish plays for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they take like a 20 or 30 minute
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out, and they do like another
hour and a half, and then they do an
[SPEAKER_00]: encore after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did their first hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other people getting
down next to me, and at set break,
[SPEAKER_00]: I start a conversation with some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This young lady that I had been dancing
kind of with, kind of right next to for
[SPEAKER_00]: about an hour now, in conversation,
I found out that she was in one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite movies, and I didn't even realize
it the whole time I'd been standing next
[SPEAKER_00]: to her for the whole concert so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even realize that this was an
actress in one of my favorite movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of fun to find out just
through casual conversation that she
[SPEAKER_00]: played a part in a movie I've seen a
thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to act like I was not starstruck
and had to keep the conversation going,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then the band came back out and they
killed it for the second half of Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole weekend was great, but Sunday
was my favorite of all three shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say never miss a Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first half of Sunday, they played some
great songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second half of Sunday, they played
great songs, and the jams were insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunday was a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we walked out of the show after the
show was over, and there was a marching
[SPEAKER_00]: band playing fish tunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a dude with a giant bass drum
beating the bass drum with mallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy with a marching snare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple other guys with
percussion instruments, and then a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: horn section blowing out fish tunes on
horns New Orleans style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got down to that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just stood in the parking lot and just
danced to that, smoked a couple of joints,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit a vape pen a bunch of times,
just watched everybody be hippies,
[SPEAKER_00]: watch everybody do nitrous and whatever
else they were doing and run around like
[SPEAKER_00]: wooks and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was just grooving in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate some parking lot pizza, had some
parking lot burritos, had a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the marching band ended, and we
discovered the ball pit car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known about the ball pit car since I
lived in Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that own the ball pit car were
actually friends of mine in Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they're actually still friends of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say were friends of mine,
but these guys, I've known them since
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like an El Camino or a
Ranchero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a small truck with a long bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a little liner inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a little net around the thing
like you'd kind of put a low net like
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd put around a trampoline so nobody
flies out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put that net around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they fill the bed of the truck type
vehicle with the balls that you'd put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: ball pit at Chuck E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a ball pit car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drive it and have the ball pit
active, but they park it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up a pretty dope sound system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hang a disco ball up above the center
of the ball pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People dance around the car while the cool
music plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play a lot of talking heads to tell
you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dance around the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people dive into the ball pit and
roll around on the ball pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fun little thing to have kind
of a sideshow attraction at the fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not involved with the show or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty and the magic of the
fish parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that is organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just all done by fish kids that
have been going to fish shows for years
[SPEAKER_00]: and years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've picked up the culture from the
Grateful Dead where when the band goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: tour, you buy your tickets before they go
on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going on summer tour,
you get your tickets in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start booking all your hotels and all
your camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the band goes out,
you've got the car packed and you just go
[SPEAKER_00]: to every show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go down to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you come through Colorado and then
you go wherever they go next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just travel around with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have figured out ways how to
support themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, people do sell drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also sell food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sell shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are selling hats,
fish hats, grassroots hats, other random
[SPEAKER_00]: hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people selling crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people selling paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of artwork on the lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of just people selling alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of places won't allow us to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we've gone to other states and other
cities, we've been in trouble for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this and they shut us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the City of Commerce City was very
kind to us this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll never hear this, but I think it's
fucking cool that they allowed us to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the premises at Dix in the parking lot,
there's a big dirt parking lot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let a bunch of people set up tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, little pop-up tents,
little pop-ups like you have at any other
[SPEAKER_00]: chili cook-off festival or whatever kind
of festival you have downtown in your
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis cup, we all just bring a
pop-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set up under that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People bring that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up their grill and they sell
grilled cheese sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get fajitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could eat out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could live out there on that parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's alcohol for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get any kind of drink concoction
you wanted out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get fresh margaritas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get PBR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get anything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a dank dark beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get a dollar beer, shitty beer
for a dollar, good beer for three bucks or
[SPEAKER_00]: two for five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depends on what you want to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could eat like a king or you could eat
like a fucking dirty hippie out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all there and it's all brought by
kids who have been going to a lot of shows
[SPEAKER_00]: and have learned that they want to fund
their way in sort of a productive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're providing a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to eat because that dude was selling
pizza and he got to go to the next show
[SPEAKER_00]: because I spent six or seven bucks at his
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set up a little community there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Commerce City let us do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let us set up our booths and vend and
they let us just march around and be
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies for three full days and they
didn't bug us at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys watched any of my Instagram
live feed, you may have seen some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: footage from the fish parking lot party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking around and then I showed a
little bit of the ball pit car party,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was having conversation with some
new friends and I just wanted to end the
[SPEAKER_00]: live feed and get back to the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't much footage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys put your phone away and just
enjoy the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the moments that I've got in
my head more than the shit that I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit on my phone, I just recorded that
and I wasn't even in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that I enjoyed, I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put your phone away, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've only got a couple more
things I'm gonna talk about about the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend before I move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got parking lot fun written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parking lot's awesome, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy food, you can buy drinks,
you can buy drugs, you can get hugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can meet up with your friends,
you can get some high fives, you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: new friends, you can see old friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cool thing about the parking lot is I
was walking around doing laps,
[SPEAKER_00]: just seeing people, listening to all the
music that people are playing,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what all the hippies are selling,
seeing what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked past the concert venue where the
band was gonna play and on Sunday I got
[SPEAKER_00]: there really early and they were doing
sound check.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band was checking the sound and
playing with their instruments and playing
[SPEAKER_00]: with their gear on stage, getting warmed
up for the show that night just to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure all the equipment sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we wanna go out on stage and jam
a couple new songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hear a really old, old song they
don't play very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care what it was but it was
really cool to hear a song that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: play very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played a jam out of it and then they
ended that and then they kind of tinkered
[SPEAKER_00]: with their instruments and they just kept
playing just like little short jams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the keyboard player was trying to
dial in a new sound on his keyboard so
[SPEAKER_00]: they would play for a few seconds and he
would do his little keyboard part and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd stop and then you'd hear them wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, and kind of tweak
[SPEAKER_00]: the sound a little bit and then they'd go
back to playing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was super cool hearing them do sound
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played a really old song that they
don't play on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard Phish do it live in the
hundreds of years I've been listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: Phish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to tapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been paying attention to live stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never done it that I've paid
attention to and they played part of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a jam during sound check and we all
applauded at the end of it and Trey,
[SPEAKER_00]: the singer, laughed and he goes,
ha, ha, this is a little song called
[SPEAKER_00]: Catapult and it's just really awesome that
they played that one and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledged us for laughing or for
applauding about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vin, what else do I have written down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I met some cool people and I ran into some
familiar people so I wanna give a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of people some shout-outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe Cindy Sue a shout-out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bumped into somebody who calls himself
Cindy Sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super shy but seemed like a very great
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout-out to Cindy Sue next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick around a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout-out to Chris Chiari.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm saying that right, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't seen you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to bump into you at a Phish
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have known I would see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout-out to my friends from
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and Baker, I love you guys all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for always taking good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One night, I had the honor of meeting a
couple who run a hemp company called
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamia Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were great to talk to, very
enthusiastic cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hemp farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a podcast listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a very passionate farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say that I light up when I talk
about cannabis and I saw that same light
[SPEAKER_00]: in this young lady's eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she would talk about cannabis,
her eyes would twinkle like it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun having a conversation with
somebody who loves cannabis as much as I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take a great picture with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for introducing yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for stopping and saying hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to visiting the Vitamia
Hemp farm one of these days soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, somebody else sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, hey, I saw you at Phish but I
didn't want to interrupt you because you
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably talking to Vitamia Hemp
because I spent a lot of time with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're at a Phish, show and you walk by
and you want to introduce yourself and say
[SPEAKER_00]: hi to me, if we know each other,
if we've never met, if we're longtime
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, if you want to be new friends,
it's a Phish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the band is not playing,
stop and say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a social event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be social.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there to make friends and have
friends and be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if the person that said they saw
me and didn't want to interrupt,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're an old friend and I haven't seen
them in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been pretty cool to see and
get a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stop and say what's up at a Phish
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that shy and it's a Phish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wear a shirt that says don't talk to
me while Phish is playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the band is playing, you should be
dancing and letting all your problems
[SPEAKER_00]: escape your mind and set your soul free
and cleanse your shit and have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do the same thing but as soon
as they're done, let's smoke a joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about all the stuff that's on your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce yourself and say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce yourself at a Phish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to meet each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably smoke a joint with you if
I've got one left.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good segue to talk about the last
part of my Phish talk for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Colorado, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is legal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're 21 and over, we can possess,
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can enjoy our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you cannot take your cannabis
into the concert venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick's Sporting Goods Stadium,
whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick's Sporting Goods Field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick's Sporting Goods Field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a giant soccer field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not invite you or encourage you or
allow you to bring in your cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing a very light search on the
way into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a metal detector and you've got
to take out all of your metal,
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone, your lighter, your car keys
and put that in a little basket and they
[SPEAKER_00]: slide that through a little thing that
goes past the metal detector so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you walk through and if it doesn't
beep, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a joint or a bunch of joints
or a baggie of weed in your pocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to sneak right through that
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't care about that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took several joints every night into the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you had a backpack or some
sort of a purse, they'd make you open your
[SPEAKER_00]: purse and unzip all the pouches in the
purse and they'd go through that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line was long and there were a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I watched a lot of people get a lot of
shit taken from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would open up your purse and they
would find a lot of vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't take in a nicotine or a
cannabis vape pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want those in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they found that, they'd give you the
option to walk back to your car and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: away or they wanted you to throw it in a
trash bag that was right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and that bag was full.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of people were smart when they
found their vape pens and they didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to walk back to their car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, you can't throw it
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would take a big ass rip off of it
and then pass it to the person in line
[SPEAKER_00]: behind them and that person would hit it
and then just pass it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that vape pen would get consumed
instead of being thrown away, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was very smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got to hit one of the vape pens
that was discovered by security and before
[SPEAKER_00]: that person threw it into the trash bag,
they passed it into the people in line and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like the second or third person in
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went to one person and then it came
to me and I took a big fat rip off of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I just passed that vape pen down
the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't go in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't make it into the show,
however.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all you had to do is put it in your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could load your pockets up with stuff
and you could take it right into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were plenty of vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was plenty of whatever in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smelled people smoking DMT in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smelled people smoking plenty of weed in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see the looks on people's faces
that plenty of shit made it past security.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lady in line in front of me on
Sunday did not get her mountain of fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles through security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what she was thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a little purse and when he opened
it up, they sell edibles in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a giant film canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a child-proof container,
semi-child-proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: You squeeze it and the lid pops open.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they sell your edibles in these types
of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lady had like six of them in her
purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guy opens a purse and he just grabs
them and he goes, these aren't going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her husband or boyfriend or whatever
had already made it through security.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's already in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the security guard's like,
you got to take these back to the car or
[SPEAKER_00]: throw them away right here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just grabs them and stuffs them in
her purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's pissed off because she's got to
go figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her husband's in the show now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that security was not letting her
through with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what happened with the
edibles, but they would not let you
[SPEAKER_00]: through with edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they discovered them, they would not
let you through with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two water bottles in my pocket and
security didn't even notice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were discreet, you could
probably get through there with whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted if it wasn't metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how the vape pins weren't
setting off the metal detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a bunch of the Green Dot vape pins
in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were making it through security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also ran into one of the Green Dot reps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good talking with you about Green
Dot products.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's enough talking
about fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably just bored the shit out of
everybody for like 15 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew this was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys knew I just went and saw fish all
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you knew I had to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you that I've got a whole bunch
of great grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that, but this fish vacation
was what I was waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get this out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my big release and my recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of great episodes
written.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to get overloaded with grow
information coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode is number 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get Mike over to do
some recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blaming Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not calling Mike out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying he's a new father.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to not a new father.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a new father again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's double timing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he can't come over as frequently as I'd
like him to to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can get him here, Mike and I will
record episode 350 together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, of course, it's just going to be
me by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, you guys, it is going to
be grow school time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to get out your notebook and
do some learning with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take you guys to Rasta Jeff's Cannabis
School.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back to the education part of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you guys, I'm fucking rambling
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those coffee nectar dabs are
starting to wear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to do another dab here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do that, let's get to the
Twitter part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes back, I asked you if you
could smoke a joint with anybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: who would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a lot of great Twitter replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people said they would like to
smoke with their father who has passed
[SPEAKER_00]: away and that I kind of honestly expected
that answer from a lot of folk because
[SPEAKER_00]: that just seems like something that a lot
of people would have wanted to do like an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity maybe a lot of young men were
looking for that they never got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would have been a really an
opening opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been a good icebreaker for
maybe a couple of men who didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could consume some cannabis together
and loosen up and then you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be macho with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may have helped out with a lot of
male relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big respect to everybody who reached
out and said that they wanted to that
[SPEAKER_00]: their choice of who they would smoke with
dead or alive was their father who has
[SPEAKER_00]: passed because it probably took some
courage to reach out and say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably a sincere moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for sharing that with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try to dig in here and
find a few more of those replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I read the replies, I'll actually
read the tweet that I tweeted on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, if you could smoke a joint with
any person living or dead, who would you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the person you chose has passed,
which era of that person's life would you
[SPEAKER_00]: reanimate them from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an example, I said, Jerry Garcia,
circa 1977.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think about it,
if I said I want to smoke a joint with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry Garcia, right now, if you dug Jerry
Garcia up and let me smoke a joint with
[SPEAKER_00]: him, he had so many years of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he lived 53 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a lot of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to smoke with him as a little kid
when he didn't know shit about the guitar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to smoke with him with the
height of his career?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to smoke with him at the end,
right before he died, when he had all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which option?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said circa 1977.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point in Jerry's life, I think it
was around the mid 80s, about 84,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry slipped into a diabetic coma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to talk to Jerry before that
coma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if I was going to smoke with Jerry,
I'd want to do it when he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: young and hip and fucking kind of my age I
am now and I think that was around 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jerry Garcia around 77 or my other
example was my gramps in 1995 ish that
[SPEAKER_00]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when my gramps and I were really
clicking and I was adult enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to have a good conversation with
the old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was still healthy enough to have a
good conversation with the young man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were getting along really well at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could smoke a joint with any
person, living or dead, it'd be a tough
[SPEAKER_00]: choice between Jerry in 77 and my gramps
in 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I wanted to get realistic and smoke
with somebody who is alive, and this was
[SPEAKER_00]: an actual opportunity for myself,
my reply was I've smoked with most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket list of stoners, but I love to
smoke with Joe Rogan before my time is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smoked with Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen him do comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the same room as him.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of times, never consumed cannabis
with Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I would like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan is probably my number one
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoop Dogg is up on that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few other musicians and
comedians I'd like to smoke with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think Joe Rogan is my number one
decision there of a living person I'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's read some of the Twitter
replies now that I've set this up so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Clint Stewart, what's up Clint?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at tall Clint on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint said Trump today to try and figure
out what his game plan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Clint wants to smoke a joint with the
POTUS, with President Trump, and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck his game plan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how that's gonna go for
either one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's a big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might wanna have a bunch of secret
service dudes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aldridge said, my pops, whenever,
wherever, I never got the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me share that Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our friend at Couch Glow said,
Terrence McKenna in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrence didn't smoke a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrence McKenna was heavily into
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an ethnopharmacologist is what I
think he called himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a lot of hallucinogenic drugs,
a lot of spiritual drugs, but he wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that the best way to consume
cannabis was to go for long periods of
[SPEAKER_00]: time without cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do, smoke as much as you
can possibly handle was his theory on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that's the way it worked the best
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smoking with Terrence would probably
lead to some really crazy conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to hear some of his stories of going
to other countries and consuming some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the drugs that they've offered him there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the adventures with his brother
Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the adventures with Terrence,
Dennis, and the other scientists they used
[SPEAKER_00]: to travel with doing drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And experiencing other cultures and doing
drugs on small islands with the indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear those stories with
Terrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a fucking really good reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this guy says, he calls themselves
free market capitalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not spelled the natural way,
but it's spelled Twitter way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, Ernest Hemingway in Paris in the
20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is quite an elegant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know more about you because that
tells me you are a bright person and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got good taste and that you've got
to have good conversational skills for
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks for the great replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never too late to send in a reply to
a Twitter question or a podcast question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask you once again, if you could smoke a
joint with any person living or dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: who would you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that person you choose has passed
away, which era of that life would you
[SPEAKER_00]: reanimate that person from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also got a backup question for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get to smoke a joint with this
one person, what strain would you choose
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke with your pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet, it's at GFYH podcast on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, this podcast is
getting long and we haven't really talked
[SPEAKER_00]: much about cannabis news, education or
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about Twitter stuff and we
have talked about a fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bonus nugget here at the
end of the show for everybody that has
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck around this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've listened to the show for a
while, you know that a while back I did an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode called Email from a Cop,
which was followed by Email from a Cop
[SPEAKER_00]: Part 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email from a law enforcement
officer who wanted to give us some
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tips and hints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read his email.
[SPEAKER_00]: People replied with more questions than he
replied with answers to those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in a recent episode, somebody asked
about keeping your cannabis in your glove
[SPEAKER_00]: box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is law enforcement allowed to search your
glove box when you get pulled over?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have a solid answer,
but I knew my law enforcement friend would
[SPEAKER_00]: be listening and that he would chime in
with feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is, Email from a Cop Part 3,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Hey Rasta Jeff, heard the
question about the glove box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were pretty much spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I said was they can get that shit
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to open it, they'll open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not legal, they will use
their badge and their bullshit to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to get into that glove box and blame
it on you is basically what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said you're pretty much spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is probable cause, there is very
little hesitation on the cops in to break
[SPEAKER_00]: open a glove box.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, with probable cause, refusing to
open the glove box could be stretched into
[SPEAKER_00]: delaying or obstructing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are also right about the fake smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cops want in, they are getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he's saying about the fake smell,
as I said, if the cops really want in your
[SPEAKER_00]: glove box, they look at each other and
they go, I smell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got probable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the games that the cops play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our law enforcement friend says that
we are accurate with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys don't keep your cannabis in
the glove box and think that you're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep anything illegal in the glove
box and think that you're safe from law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they think that you've got something
and they want in that glove box,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will ask you to open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not open it, you may be delaying
their investigation or obstructing their
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you are, the wording
will be different, but you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: charged with basically the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not complying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making their investigation harder
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you don't want to do that,
and they don't want to mess with you for
[SPEAKER_00]: delaying or obstructing, they just say
probable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like marijuana in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't open the glove box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for being a dick, I'm going to get a
crowbar and I'm going to pull this fucker
[SPEAKER_00]: apart and destroy your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't keep your stuff in the glove box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put anything illegal in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You honestly shouldn't have anything
illegal in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something, the first rule,
let's let's rewind here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about rule number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only break one rule at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something in the car that
you're worried about law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: finding, drive like you were taking a
driving test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire time you've got something
illegal in the car, drive like you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something illegal in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do dumb shit to get yourself pulled
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play the music at an acceptable volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to a complete stop at stop signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drive too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut anybody off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your fucking blinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike would teach us only break one
rule at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always remember that you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the rule that you have chosen to
break is to have something illegal in your
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle, don't break any other rules so
that that thing gets discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you insist on having something
illegal in the vehicle, and I can't advise
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do that, I have to say don't put
anything illegal in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, though, don't put it in the
glove box because you're going to reach in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to get your license, registration,
proof of insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to open up the glove box and
you go, oh, register your license is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go on registration,
proof of insurance and my bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go, officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you lock it and they want in there,
they're going to bust it open and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: out and charge you with obstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this email goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the only thing about the use of a
dog is it cannot prolong a traffic stop
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than a reasonable time to write a
ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you get stopped and the
reason is a tail light out and the cop
[SPEAKER_00]: calls a dog over and 45 minutes later,
the dog arrives in alerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you have been unlawfully
delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cops can only hold you there for a
reasonable amount of time to write a
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were pulled over for having a
tail light out or because you were
[SPEAKER_00]: speeding, that cop can only keep you there
long enough to write you that ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he is supposed to let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't hold you there forever if it
takes a long time for that dog to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a bunch of stupid catches
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's writing your ticket and it's
taking a really long time for dispatch to
[SPEAKER_00]: run your ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever notice if you get pulled over
and you're late for work and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: speeding, the cop says, I'm just going to
run your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes for fucking ever to run your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's late at night and they're looking
for somebody and you get pulled over and
[SPEAKER_00]: they run your stuff, it only takes a
couple of minutes because they want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: your shit and get back on the case and
find the guy that did the shit late at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't match that description,
if you're not guilty or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't run your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to bug you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of my way so I can go find the
actual perp I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a traffic stop during the day and
you say, oh, I was speeding because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: late.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, yeah, fuck you, pal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be late as fuck now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes them all day to run your
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just sit there and you're just later
and later for work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're doing it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll do that same shit to delay you
to get that dog time to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing that could happen,
maybe the dog's not far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they got him right down the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that cop dog is just driving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he just came from training class and
he's out driving looking for some shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, hey, is the K-9 unit
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill, we're right here three blocks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cop's going to come smell your
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that dog's going to alert that you've
got something in the glove box and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put you in cuffs and put you in
the back of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to let you open the
glove box to get your urb out to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: to them because you already had that
chance and you done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to break that shit open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got your keys because they're in
the ignition of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pry that shit open
because you lied and wasted their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they want to fuck your life up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're supposed to play by certain
rules, but so are we.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know how to bend the rules to
make things work for what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our law enforcement friend ends his email
with the best piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, best rule of thumb for
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be writing dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best rule of thumb is don't be
writing dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you insist on writing dirty,
only break one rule at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends the email by saying, peace and
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be safe out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sends me a little personal
note that I'm not going to include here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but dude, that's a great ending to that
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to add to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, obviously not all law
enforcement are terrible people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is law enforcement and he's
giving us advice on how to not get in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the first thing you should do
if you get pulled over is try to play the
[SPEAKER_00]: nice guy role with the cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be polite and maybe you will do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then you can adjust your
conversation as needed, but start the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation off polite and friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off your sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look them in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand them your license, registration,
proof of insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be an adult about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the first thing I said to you when we
met was what the fuck do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to have a good
conversation no matter what I had in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the first thing I say to you when we
meet is good afternoon, sir, how can I
[SPEAKER_00]: help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conversation may go a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to determine a lot of the
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things you really need to be
saying to law enforcement are yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: sir, and no, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, you're just digging your
own grave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're digging yourself a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five and nearly 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting skinny lately, but I'm still a
big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be intimidating to law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a big dude, keep that type of
stuff in mind, especially if it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big guys make little cops nervous and
they've got something to prove so they get
[SPEAKER_00]: shaky around us and they got to keep an
eye on you and they get squirrely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that kind of stuff in mind when
you're dealing with law enforcement,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind you get to dictate a lot
of the way the interaction goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some cops out there that are
going to fuck your day up no matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: you act, but not all of them want to ruin
your day or life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've obviously got one friend here who's
helping us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to keep in mind is
don't ride dirty if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to ride dirty,
only break one rule at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've chosen to ride dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rule we're going to break
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got to do the speed limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to come to a complete stop at every
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to use the turn signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive like your mama's in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's going to smack the shit out of
you if you get crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you do get pulled over,
be respectful and polite to law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make any jittery moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't reach for shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to have your license, registration and
proof of insurance ready for law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement when they approach the
vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the windows down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your hands visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your paperwork and your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he says license, registration,
proof of insurance, be able to hand it to
[SPEAKER_00]: him with a smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wearing sunglasses, take them
off and look them in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, look, I ain't got shit to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comply with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give him any reason to taze,
mace or shoot your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't consent to anything you're not
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to remember that every question they
ask you is a trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that two or three questions after that
question is going to be the same question
[SPEAKER_00]: worded differently to try to get you to
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, sir is plenty of information for
law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to know much else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to tell them anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only tell them what you're comfortable
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you decide at any time you've said
enough, you can stop talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the right to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, sir is enough information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like I need to make a
disclaimer that I am not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been to law school.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking for real legal advice
in a situation like this, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you speak with a qualified
attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't try to go to court with any
rasta Jeff legal advice that could go
[SPEAKER_00]: horribly wrong for you.
