[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you guys ready for the Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're talking about the booth and
everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Busy, busy year ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to do every cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably going to skip Seattle this
year, but we are doing Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also be doing the 710 Cup in Denver,
and we have the San Francisco Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sour Seeds is killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Canaventure joining for everything?
Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, some Jeff soju.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got the Jeff soju.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Dante.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a ... Come from Karma Suiticals in
Denver, actually.
Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We acquired the cut through Dan Hayet,
who was recently in Tide Times last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a homegrown Pueblo caregiver right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tested out a couple strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: His Dante tested 28.8, and his kilowatt
was 29.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Impressive test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually tested it three times over
each test.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did the first sample for the first
$50, and then they gave him the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's been doing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was working with Dan Sky from High
Times Magazine right now, and he's Allen
[SPEAKER_01]: Westcliff doing his thing this year,
and hopefully we'll see him around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's invited to the podcast,
if you want to bring him on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dan, the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to come to shop all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy, good guy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he gave me the cut, and it's
actually a pineapple grenades crossed with
[SPEAKER_01]: a skunk triple six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've taken it now, and we're taking it
a step further in creating the Dante's
[SPEAKER_01]: Inferno, which is the same hybrid crossed
out with the OG18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually going to ask a few breeding
questions and stuff of you on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it sounds like a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first question is going to be to both
of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get into the breeding game,
and how long have you been breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been breeding since I was
about 15 or 16 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents were longtime growers in the
state of Florida, South Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were underground growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had large horticulture nursery,
about five and a half, six acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a whiteout greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 30 by 100 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Full of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got balls of steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your parents had balls of steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, my mom actually took her until she
was almost 60 years old, and recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: the last five years, she actually did get
incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it was kind of messed up because
it is just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she was busted with around 24
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did get a slap on the wristboard,
and fortunately for her, they did find out
[SPEAKER_01]: the FBI came in, and they were doing a
drug sting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys were taking the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were taking the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were stealing the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were stealing the cannabis,
and they were flipping it back on the
[SPEAKER_01]: streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 12 officers were involved in it,
and it was in big news down in Tampa,
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida last year or so, last couple
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mom's kind of a celebrity for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been a freedom fighter her whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we call her on the show to give
her a shout out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherry, mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, Sherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out for being a cannabis
warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is she free now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is she out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's here, and now she's living in
Colorado, the great state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll keep her out of trouble here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's loving the freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's loving the mountains, the
atmosphere, and the people, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people, the attitude's great here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome home, mama sour seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep you out of trouble here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Rusty, my friend with Cannaventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you're a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I met you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some fucking fun times
together, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you been in this breeding
game?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess about six years, but I mean,
I've been breeding forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't... What grower doesn't see
plants and... Okay, so that's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long into your growing career did it
take you to get breeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I'd say for the first like,
I don't know, four or five years,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it was just straight growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you first get started, you know,
outdoor or whatever, but I'd say like six,
[SPEAKER_04]: seven years before, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's how long it takes you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four to six years seems to be for most of
the major breeders that I've talked to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, when I grew those plants the
first couple of years, I knew I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed, but then you have to figure out how
and where.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being from the area that we were in in the
underground, you know, you couldn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the early 90s and stuff and being
in places like Florida, which is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the worst states to possibly grow it in,
Virginia, places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: East coast is really, really throw you
under the bus, lock you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you couldn't really order seeds,
you know, and get certain strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever you got good genetics and you
got good males, you may do with what you
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you used a lot of older genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally used a lot of older genetics
when we were younger from parents passed
[SPEAKER_01]: down Gainesville Green, old Afghans,
a lot of old Afghani and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the old piney, you know,
good piney buds that came out of Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida is known for a lot of great
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get enough credit, in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past few years, they've really been
known for it and noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say in the last 10 years,
there's actually been statistics to show
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's more growers indoors that get
busted every year in Florida than there
[SPEAKER_01]: are registered cannabis users in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say this all the time on this show,
the logical step here, fucking legalize it
[SPEAKER_00]: in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why, you know, banging down little
old ladies, you know, doors and dragging
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your mom, I'm pretty sure at her
age now, she's a hardcore criminal,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure she was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open the door for him and told him to come
right on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it was just about she's
one of those type of women.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my mom's really cool lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just she gets your high first and then
makes you cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on in, officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you cuff everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally her attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad she's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to smoke out one day if
she's absolutely a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get it back on course,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get so ADD in this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we kind of skipped over how long
you've been breeding a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been for about six years,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been in the in the game for about
six years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess I've been selling seeds for
like six, six years or so, you know what I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely for since I started.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 10, 11 years, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's what are some of your favorite
strains that you've now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of your now current favorite
strains to grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you as far as like clone onlys or
whatever you were going to like?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was like, so you can fill this whole
room with whatever you want, you get three
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd say cookie rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, very cool choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little fucking whatever,
you know, but out of proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I've seen a shout out to
Garden of Weed and grow the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your cookie rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you owe them a high five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Triple Nova.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a new one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some packs I brought you today.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll run that pretty soon to take
pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Triangle Kush and Blackberry
Kush Clone BX out cross by train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcada.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my head seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this BX too.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: My third one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'm working on one now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas Kids Bloody Mary Cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's pretty rare cut, but working
that back with Orange Diesel, Cali's 77
[SPEAKER_04]: cut and Calio cut with their rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or no, some of New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything so I love and that's a great
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds like a great cross there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, random question.
[SPEAKER_00]: On an offshoot of that, are those your top
sellers by any chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know one can't be because you're
still making it, but the cookie rack
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like it's probably one of your top
sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's definitely one of your top
sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great, great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen coals longer than my arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it matches up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both parents match up just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't sound like it, but once you get
to know both parents, it will definitely
match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the breeder aspect, you can tell that
that's a beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, here's a hint that I don't talk
about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more difference, no, the most
difference in your parents, the better the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome in your cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got completely different
parents, the better your crosses are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bro over here, Mr. Sour Seeds,
what are some of your favorite strains to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top three, I'd probably say one of my
number one strains is still to this day is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the original Chem Dog D or Chem
4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still to this day, it's not the
frosty strain in the world, but it has
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the greatest flavors all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got the bang, it's got the
flavor, it's got the punch, it's got the
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bag of peel, the yield, the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the original true OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say right now too, it still is one of
my family's original strains from way
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've held this cut for probably close to
eight to 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of our original blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the old original blueberry yum yum
used to hear about from Lou to Chris and
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not DJ's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very indica dominant blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost smells like ripe oranges halfway
through flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it really takes on a really sweet
blueberry appeal during finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very potent, very frosty, very couch lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, quick eight, nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very indica plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to take you 10 weeks to
flower out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one we run is probably a big
one that we're having a big release on now
[SPEAKER_01]: is the Space Dragon, which is a true West
Himalayan Cush land race crossed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: original Chem 91 back cross male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a cross that was done probably
seven, eight years ago in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now it's one of the hottest
things in Atlanta, Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been nice for years down there and
ran Tallahassee, Florida and FSU college
[SPEAKER_01]: for I don't know how many years we slung
that stuff out on the streets and people
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten reviews from everywhere from,
you know, the little guy to people that
[SPEAKER_01]: fight for the UFC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually sold pot to people like
Sebastian, Sebastian Janikowski and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, big football players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's it's the guys they just
can't they can't get enough of the Space
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lays you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you really can't think on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's one of those even for the
heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for something like that,
that just you really want to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, just really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because you build up tolerance
over years and years doing this and you
[SPEAKER_01]: look for sought out strains that you,
you know, that won't burn you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, seven, eight years,
I can still smoke this stuff and it still
[SPEAKER_01]: does the same effect to me that it did
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to get an old school
new school kind of a combo there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it is like you said, very diverse
genetics, you know, taking something from
[SPEAKER_01]: here in America and then taking it with
the best of the, you know, these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, across the world, you know,
and just trying to combine those genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: to give somebody something really,
really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm imagining kind of a real spicy,
real hashy, earthy, spicy kind of a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is real earthy and it has a spice to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's actually it's really hard to
really describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's it's been described as like
really sweet, but also has like a very
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelming sense of B.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: like body odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jeff Soji he's playing with has like a
swampy, funky foot B.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really B.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, but it's on the sweeter side and it
has that kind of citrusy twang kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: funk from the Kim 91 in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's really original.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody that's ever had it's really
truly enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I look forward to my seed pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming soon like that or my clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I can do that from your
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was two strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the cam and then you got your
space dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's strain number three?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: See dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame it on a head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can probably do one or two more
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys have been listening and
you heard about that, I had a serious and
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a serious concussion, but I had a
minor brain bleed and I was down for about
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been seven days now and I'm still a
little goofy when I wake up and it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: me like an hour to get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to be fine, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of people told me to get well and
I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my brain was bleeding inside my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my eyes were wobbling and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've listened to the last two
episodes, I was doing that fully
[SPEAKER_00]: concussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently I blew off two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to meet somebody somewhere
and I blew them off completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody was nice enough to say he
hit his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be nice about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least you had a legitimate excuse
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't just dabbing on the couch like
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are your three favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of those... Oh, he's coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to give him a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since one's not released yet, are those
your best sellers or do you even release
[SPEAKER_00]: the...
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell the blueberry yum-yum
because it's not yours to release,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is mine to release.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, I'm the only one in Colorado that
has that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought it here from Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually brought it into Computer Case
2000 miles over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are mad men.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are mad men.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to bring some diverse genetics
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only brought a couple of strains with
us, but it was our best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we brought with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the old strains are dead and
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gainesville Green is dead and gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is dead and gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My uncle actually had a big hand in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, he still grows cannabis,
but he's completely blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he literally takes care of massive
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his plants look beautiful and amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been growing the same strains,
the blueberry yum-yum, Gainesville Green
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still got it?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, I haven't talked to that
man in so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good guy to get in top contact
with, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a lot of the old skunks,
the old original skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've all either been out-crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's things that you can find
in Florida that are very close,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's an out-cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in SoCal, and there was a skunk
strain there that I have never smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: since I've left that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the Long Beach area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was where my herb was coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, I've never smelled anything like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest I've gotten was I was at a
Phil Lesh and Friends show.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Red Rocks in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dude said, humble gold for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I remember the old humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked over there and I was like,
how much for a quarter, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, 90 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I handed him a hundred dollar bill and
just walked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was as close as I've gotten since I
left California to the smell of just that
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while you do, you come
across that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very rare though nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it hasn't been put its hands on or
it's really locked down on inner circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Canaventure, do you prefer to grow or
breed sativas or Indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a weird, I fucked that question up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer to grow and breed Indicors
or sativas is what I was aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dab while you answer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Preferably, man, I like to smoke like
sativa hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, I do breed with some straight up a
hundred percent Indica stuff, real diamond
[SPEAKER_04]: Indica diamond stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to keep those.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the CBD patients, Indica
patients need their medicine too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to, you have to, you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to catch myself breeding heavier
toward the sativa side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cause you like it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that 10 or 17 day extra longer
flowering period really does something to
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not an Indica smoker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've gotten older, I feel like
smoking Indica just makes me too lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got to be, so I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of sativa to keep me moving and motivated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, I really don't smoke into
cause man, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you still have some that you love,
you know, that, you know, that are good,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't know preferably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I find weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like growing, smoking and breeding
completely different strains for different
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to grow one, I pick a room
for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to breed, I want these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm going to smoke, I want this
like completely different batches of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually an Indica guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an Indica guy and I like OG cushions a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's pretty much what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like stuff that puts me to the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of need it nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this a really long time
and I've always had a lot of strong pot
[SPEAKER_01]: around, you know, that that's the thing
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really grow up smoking swag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always had good homegrown, you know,
and that's why I build the tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you're like 15 years old and you
can out smoke your, you know, your
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, so, so it takes something
like that for me, but like, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: like when I, when I'm working,
if I'm doing some like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy labor or anything like that,
working in the gardens and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that is the great, that's, that's when the
blue dream comes out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, that's pretty much my main
sativa that I will run is my Cali cut blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the cut that goes around this town
a lot real tall?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the nice thin blades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit that with a grateful dog,
Pollen and she's been called blue healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cut does wonderful work with every,
it is a true breeding cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't hardly get it to, it is a hard to
cut even to get to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stress it out, kick it down the
street.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to perform every single time,
no matter really what you hit it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked about this on the show
and this is way off the topic that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: written, but you guys will be two people
that appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I should ask, do you work with
any, uh, feminine seeds, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing it for, I've been
talking about it for probably three or
[SPEAKER_04]: four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's selling out a little bit,
but in, but look, okay, let me clear
[SPEAKER_04]: myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's taken me a while to get there,
but there is absolutely a purpose for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as, I mean, totally, you know,
it's undeniable, really, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I did it was because I wanted
to replicate a strain that I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good, another cross for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't want to outbreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to duplicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just selfed it and made,
that's how I made it once.
[SPEAKER_04]: 85%.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a whole lot going on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just reverse a plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't make as near as much
pollen as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's why I don't,
that's you guys, that's why everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out of my seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can't make enough pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got room for all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't make enough pollen to hit all
these plants with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab and then I'll tell
you why I was talking about feminine
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honestly going to try to remember
while I take this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, there's a purpose for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, like, like Jeff was
saying, you know, it's a lot about the
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation, the preservation of clone
only or, you know, save, even if it's your
[SPEAKER_01]: own hybrid and you, you run through a
hundred seeds and you find that one
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect female, that super female,
you know, that, that, that they're right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect example of why you should feminize
that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stabilize it right out the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we've done with our space
dragon.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, is just to S1 it,
give everybody the same version that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown to love for seven, eight years,
you know, and the only way to really do
[SPEAKER_01]: that truly is to not out cross it is to
feminize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a lot more fun out crossing it
though, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is because of the variety, like you
were saying, the diversity of genetics to
[SPEAKER_01]: define what, watch nature take over the
natural selection and just watch,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just, just watch it take hold
and really do what nature does,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out talking
about doing what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage green genetics is an F1 monster
putting out the F1 to show in diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know what that means,
you'll give them a shout out for that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't understand that you'll catch
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage puts out, I don't trust most F1s,
but Gage's F1s are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage has something special going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keyplay and that crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what names they want me to
use, but shout out to Keyplay and the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call him Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: M4K.
[SPEAKER_00]: MK4.
[SPEAKER_00]: MK4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ADD thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, shout out to that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys do amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look up to them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do a lot of test work for Gage
Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got done running through some
eight, like seven, eight year old beans
[SPEAKER_01]: with the original Grape Stomper release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found a Sour Ball Spino.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so excited about this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing a lot of work with
it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage and the Cali Connection kind of put
my brand on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me free gear to run for them and
let me take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they published my pictures in
high times and skunk mag and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always seriously generous to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the newcomers into the game,
they'll even give you a chance and give
[SPEAKER_01]: you some seeds to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showed me mad love when we all met up at
the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, Swerve and the whole Gage crew,
they all gave me mad, mad love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent most of my time at the Cali
Connection booth and the rest of my time
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Gage booth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the cup last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember what I was going to say
about reversing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a strain that I, so I had a plant
and I selfed it and made seeds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept the original mommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took seeds and grew the seeds
until I found one that looked just like
[SPEAKER_00]: mommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I reversed mommy again and put
that pollen on this female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't get that offspring to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a beautiful female that is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been labeled GD 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she can't, I cannot reverse her with
undiluted colloidal silver or not
[SPEAKER_00]: colloidal silver, silver thiosulfate a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just looked at me like,
nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really true keeper there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the true breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of hosed myself because that's
one of my breeders and I was hoping to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to still reverse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go back to the other clon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that is definitely, I'm,
I was told I'm one of the only breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: that's doing solid stress tests on my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, before I'll breed with a female,
I'll take like, say I'm going to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would take blue dream and put
her in a, in a room by herself or with
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else I'm testing and run the
light cycle for two weeks the way she
[SPEAKER_00]: should in flower and then disrupt it and
like turn it to the opposite and see if I
[SPEAKER_00]: can make her her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, then I'll use those to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they, if I really got to kick their ass
to make them herm, then I'll use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they herm too easily, I'll toss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even waste my time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't want to put out more herm
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's something I've talked about a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way off of my notes, but this is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like this random chatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you guys will have an answer to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed a golden goat plant and I took
the pollen and I put it on four other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and it made great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the plants, the headband plant
shriveled up and died when the pollen hit
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the pistols went new and it shriveled
up and straight up died.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant died.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights were going off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated right before sunset or lights
out and just hit the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched, hung out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was like, oh, lights are going
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back the next day to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant was dead, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other plants in the room were all,
everybody was happy, iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's getting the same treatment
except that headband plant over in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner was like new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm the only one that had access,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't, I don't, nobody touches my
breeding shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never, I've actually never seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that's one of the other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone looked at me like, yeah,
you did something really wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you fed that plant battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I wondered if maybe anybody had
seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's looking at me like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm trying it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that room behind us, there's,
there's a golden, a reversed golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room in there with a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It killed a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a headband and gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hate each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Kalanji cushion there and then a
lemon skunk so you can make some more
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a whole bunch of golden
goats in there to make some golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves that lemon Jeffrey and
golden goat guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen is almost falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that lemon?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that lemon cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Arian's greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse seeds from Arian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one of his, one of his Fem packs a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought us a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I love lemon turkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody bought me that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to run it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I got the, uh, the biggest cut of
that, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be like 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd hook you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, we'll trade some cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole table, we'll get together and
we'll just have some cuts to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really all about, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much of a shark tank out there
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of us that's been
doing this a long time, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: us started out underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need to stick together and keep
those circles, you know, and help each
[SPEAKER_01]: other out and then makes less of a shark
tank and more happy environment for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a cheater being a Colorado
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cause I, I got to cheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys had to hide and do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had to, you couldn't even go to
the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would follow you home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that's how my mother got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually said they slid across the
street in the East coast and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they run your tags and then that's all
they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need that number and they can get
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your name, address, what kind of insurance
you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys look out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the East coast listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go to the hydro store too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or legalize it where you are because the
States that have legal cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting full and prices are going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's rents going up everywhere now
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legalize it where you are so that that
way you don't have to move here and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: 1200 bucks for a small apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask the quay, the crazy
question now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys feel about auto flowering
seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I really don't, I really don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: More particularly, I really don't like to
grow them myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have grown plenty of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the breeding process of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been asked to grow them and breed
them, but I feel a true auto auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be 80, 90 days to 120 days from
start to finish and not these 60 day,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 day, whatever they're trying to push on
the market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way for plant to get properly
mature to give you really anything worth a
[SPEAKER_01]: dime at the end of it or worth its weight
in the effort that you put into that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: when you can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have grown regular seeds, 12 and 12 from
seed and got ounces off of them before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's, that's faster than 90
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's faster than what an auto flower can
give it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to not, you're not going
to suffer your potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for cash croppers and things like
that, that's, that's probably where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're probably most appealing getting
multiple crops or they do, I feel they do
[SPEAKER_01]: have a little bit of a place in like
stealth place, like Florida places like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do small grows, small little
plants and do a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do feminized, you know, and stay under the
radar very well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a huge, a cartel that got busted
in a national forest around here running a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, that's where they
originally started from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They growed about waist high and just
flower, you know, so they could just line
[SPEAKER_00]: them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a plot of like 50 feet by 50 feet
here and then wait three weeks and plot
[SPEAKER_00]: another plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a lot of things that go
around online and on the internet and
[SPEAKER_01]: different hearsay about where auto flowers
originally came from, whether it came from
[SPEAKER_01]: lowrider, this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really, truly where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff was the Mexican drug cartels and they
learned how to, they breed, they started
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding their own cannabis with Kansas
city ditchweed, basically hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis to get us to flower
automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they figured out they could get three
seasons a year in the same time and push
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the swag just became even
more swaggier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day though, what we're seeing
is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're seeing the push it that
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even selling any weed anymore
to America.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mexican weed is not even worth a dime
coming over the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly the opposite of what the
government said would happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually, but it pissed them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that they're doing other things to
like try to make more money and get back
[SPEAKER_00]: at us now because they're mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course that's how they're going to
roll, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stealing limes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as indoors, growing autos indoors,
I mean, you're saving two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're better at bed, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to canopy management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've talked about on the show and
then you'll get that same weight or better
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't clone your auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you find that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you find that amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Oh, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total waste of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The few times I've had really great auto
flowers and good experiences with auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was, it was, you know,
it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop real seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop real seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was like, you know,
that great sex for one night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was going to say that,
but I wasn't going to compare it to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I let someone else use that
analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, there's like knowing that
amazing girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all thinking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all dudes in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you guys a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought me, Rob brought me a dab
shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking across the table and the two
gentlemen, gentlemen joining me have this
[SPEAKER_00]: dab shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logo looks sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to take a dab every time
I see that logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be rocking it one day at the cannabis
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a long cannabis cup weekend coming
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really means a lot to me to have my
artwork out there like that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to have people like it and enjoy it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk through the cannabis cup and
someone's wearing your logo and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know, I just took a big fat puff off
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're wearing your logo and they
high five you and they're excited to see
[SPEAKER_00]: you and you're like, I just made a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting you guys at the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: People walk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you know me, if you listen to
the show, walk up, high five me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some platinum OG dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some black cherry chem dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some Jeff's OG dabs and I'm taking
to the cup with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find me at the right time,
if I'm not out, I'll dab you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are I won't have any seeds with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a private party Friday night and
they're going to be gone before I even
[SPEAKER_00]: leave that party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry y'all, but that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, you're both from different
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew in other States where it was
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you came here and you're able to
set up shop and grow and do your breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that it's a lot less stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding laws here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gray area and the breeding,
but they keep changing the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere we move to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep changing the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that messing you guys up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no matter what happens here,
I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think, I think what it really
boils down to when it, like he's saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when you're a true grower,
nothing's going to stop you doing what you
[SPEAKER_01]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think then not just cannabis or
growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it goes for all levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something that you really love to do,
regardless of who is the government to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you that you cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing I could, I could never
stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but it's, it's, it's really not going
to affect me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out in the county, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really don't have to worry about the
new, but the ordinances now with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like Pueblo, no more outdoor
growing in city limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow outdoors in our city limits
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was killed by a couple of specific
growers because they had the dank outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and they just had six foot tall plants
over the fence that smelled all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the high school down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that pissed off kind of a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question I've never asked
anybody on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to pick one, either growing or
smoking cannabis, growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that that means we're all in this
right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in it with our hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys didn't even have to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If even if I couldn't smoke cannabis,
my lungs gave out tomorrow or somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: some crazy reason that I couldn't smoke
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still, it's not, it's, it's a
learning tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Jeff, you used to, you used to
play drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that release, that release that you
get and it's your energy going into a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, you know, and you can help other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be in the worst mood and I don't
usually get in a bad mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bad day in the garden is better than a
good day at most other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can just go in the garden and
just, there's always something to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: you just go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, it's been 30 or 40
minutes and you're more, you're just,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some, you got a podcast on,
hopefully you're listening to the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast or some good
reggae music and you're just in there
[SPEAKER_00]: taking off the dead leaves or just tilling
the top soil or just staring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself just almost masturbating to
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, ah, I want to buy them drinks
and throw dollars at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, these ladies are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, if, if you understand what I'm
saying, you're listening to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what grown's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to throw dollar bills at your
sexy plants, you're growing some sexy
[SPEAKER_00]: bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stripper OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm claiming the name right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stripper OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been going about 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I'm glad you approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was very excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've dried up a little more than I
wanted, but awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys approve, then that means it's
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can someone find, other than
naturesgreenremedies.com and the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup this fall, where can people find your
seeds, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, mine, mine, mine'll just be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cannabis Cup, Natures Green Remedies,
and you'll find us at the 710 Cup this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 710 Cup in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself, Mr. Cantaventure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Attitude, Head Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the seeds get to us if we order them
from Attitude right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you heard it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard seeds from them in a
while, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard it right there, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cantaventure says you can get them from
the Tude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a coupon code or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a promo going on there though,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some free seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I'll Google it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 80% on some Triple Nova.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to go up like a week before
the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this will be up April 13th-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have, then we'll have a
really cool Cannabis Cup episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm loading the webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to the Attitude Seed Bank right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gone here in a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't, you know, I think I got some
free seeds on there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you a proper shout out on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have done some pre-show research,
but.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: These companies change so often that it's
hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't keep track of sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't keep track.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just send seeds and I take orders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play the I don't know role.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow seeds end up at Nature's Green
Remedies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They handle all that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do Bitcoin now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not advertising so much for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I heard Attitude, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard they stopped doing credit cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they show you how to get the
bitcoins too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they're trying to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, you do not have a promo this
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, not on the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, guys, support that spot because
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they as long as you pay for the
fucking guaranteed shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a shirt out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a mug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend getting a mug because they
send me a really cool DNA genetics mug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I passed that on as a Christmas gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shirts aren't as cool as the mugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a Dr. Moon shirt or some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one with like some hell betty
looking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked really obscene, but I just
wrapped other stuff up in it and sent it
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's coming up in the future for for
Sour Seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots, lots, lots in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plan to go, I say worldwide by the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we can keep up with the demand
and really do well this year, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a big tour and we're going to have a
lot of just we're just going to go out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and have fun with it, man,
and do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any plan to get your seeds on
shelves in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's a big, big, big thing for us
to at the end of the year, we're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go with our own medically infused
products license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 40 acres in Colorado City,
a one agricultural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to go big.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just going to grow and grow from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also starting our own clothing
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Life Apparel should be coming out
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff looks good, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought me a T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's just all custom done
designs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone's welcome to bring a design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can print it and you like it and
other people like it, we'll print it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like local artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to bring into that
whole scene is local design being worn at
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis cut by one of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then that's it's a good
feeling, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is a good feeling to get your
artwork out there and just just to have it
[SPEAKER_01]: seen by others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be the next greatest artist in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what tomorrow can hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a person that just drives himself to
do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy speaks the truth, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Canaventure, what's coming up in the
future, my friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys just chilling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You giving it up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going to keep smoking pot and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking love that approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students wearing a sweater and a beanie
and a T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cardigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't think of the proper word.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell he's been in the industry a
lot longer than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's already comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just like, I'm just going to smoke
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take some dads and see what those
guys think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put some pollen on some
plants, take some seeds out and send those
[SPEAKER_00]: to the attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature's good remedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, it's been cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, you see how that works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking let some shit go like that
guy just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we all do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I could tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell we were going to have fun the
minute you walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that's just great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a friend for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see like a clone trading session and
possibly I'm going to kind of say collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've actually been talking about
doing some collab and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got the best male, the best steady
male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I got a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's definitely got a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: My male, I got some pretty good males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that Kim D back across male and it
does wonderful work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost identical replica to the
original Kim Dog D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you look at them side by side and
it's hard to tell which one is the male,
[SPEAKER_01]: which one is the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in veg, you couldn't really tell
between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do a lot of cool things with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to do a lot of great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a new Sauer Alien Dog coming out
and it's basically an Alien OG white fire
[SPEAKER_01]: and that Kim Dog D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep on the lookout, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauer Seeds is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be putting out some fire
shit, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that fix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, see, I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'm going to do another shout out on
this piece of equipment, the Livewire
[SPEAKER_00]: Solutions HA04.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever buy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sound you heard was me smacking on it
to make it work properly, to bring Rusty's
[SPEAKER_00]: channel back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the same people that brought you
Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it probably?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo's great, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start closing up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can people find you online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like a website or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Milehighdank.co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an Instagram page?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, yeah, Sauer Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauer Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out there, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a Twitter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Twitter yet.
Not on the Twitter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on the Twitter yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a forum on your website also,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, our whole web forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a straight up web forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody's welcome to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers helping growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can lend you a hand if you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look to see a lot of our own genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Ross Dejef on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have CannaVenture on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see our genetics online.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see what you get out of our
genetics and how much you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that feel, man, when you just
scroll through a website and see somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: killing it with your creations?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like another piece of artwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all a work of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you like a proud pop-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your trophy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, that's really what
it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the breeder should be able to
grow the shit out of his creation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you send those seeds to just
somebody else, somebody buys them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't even know who the hell they are,
and they kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh man, that means I did that
strain right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying about F1 seeds,
that's a lot of what we do too at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time with Gage Green and a lot of the
other guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your chance to find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your chance to find that gem,
that holy grail.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Van Bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: He killed it with some of my dub wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the plant through the
trichomes and it looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did it with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is actually impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people diss on the LEDs and he
killed it with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it looks like LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All his pics are purple in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming it's LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's on my forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on, if you go to iregionxcolorado
.com, there's a forum and I'll check it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your guys' forum a little more often and
you guys go to mine and we'll all check
[SPEAKER_00]: out Van Bear's pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the killer work he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with a combination of LED and
high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been rolling with for a
little while now and it does a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: work, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what you brought smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only took a couple puffs because
everybody got lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was, unfortunately,
this was seedweed, but that's what we got
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys feel like the seeded plants
make a different kind of a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool looking light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that most of the plant's full
potential is going to just make an
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever did that room, whoever set that
room up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those LEDs and lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fucking legit, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely think that we make hash
out of all the plants that I run that have
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just pull the seeds out and make hash
out of all of it because why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you pull all the seeds out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we just, the way we do it,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the little holes mostly come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes weird, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that hash gets you higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you a different, it's like a full
body high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the head high, the body high,
you get the eye high, you get cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like all those cannabinoids are
in there when you let the plant seed
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what are you even doing,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all black-fingered over here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rubber gloves, bro, if you want a
couple of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what raw dog is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of raw dog, do you guys have a
website?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, it's being redesigned,
but we got a forum, sign up to that forum
[SPEAKER_04]: for a free weekly giveaways.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some free shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaVenture's a little ahead of the game
on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, I wouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been around a little longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're all hanging out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to collab, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use that Kim D male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the two of us will throw on a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That room looks sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sevens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: My room is sad right now because my
flowering room is totally empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because that fucking female killed
that motherfucker in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Murder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chopped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hanging on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all upside down now, so it's
anti-gravity weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon, it'll be some great medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some Tora Bora that'll heal a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topsy Turvy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does CannaVenture have an Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he don't seem like an Instagram kind
of guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a Twitter account that I came up
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, somebody out there will find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody listening will Twitter you,
and they'll be like, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty bad, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your phone will go trip, trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's horrible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be like, oh, that's my Twitter
account, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's getting bad when you can Google
your own name, and you got like one
[SPEAKER_01]: bajillion hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different things pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to look too much at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to tell these guys toward the
end of the show how many people listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do either of you have a guess how many
people hear my little show?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within 48 hours of the posting on iTunes
and Stitcher, 5,000 people have heard this
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a week, about 7,500 people will
hear the show.

[SPEAKER_04]: It's pro shit for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks, everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real, it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys walked in, and they're like,
this is some pro shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some mics and a computer,
but I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these for, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, doesn't it sound a lot better?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds so pro, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely pro shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love bullshitting with these guys,
but I should wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys only tend to listen to about 45
minutes, and we're at 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, thanks for listening to another
episode.
