[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 600 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to talk about
properly selecting a phenotype for your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout

[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did improve the show drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everybody and to all of
the Patreon contributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 episodes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never imagined it would get this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I see no end in sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are only sending me better
content, better questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interactions are much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are becoming better growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to see people evolve as growers
from the knowledge they've learned from
[SPEAKER_00]: this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not plan on stopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that all of the holiday bullshit
is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back to normal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are calming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast will kind of settle down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to the normal podcasting
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't miss an episode, but I know that
some of the episodes were short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been skipping the Patreon
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everybody was on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were on a Christmas holiday and a lot
of people weren't able to listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the regularly scheduled
podcasting listening was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have had a lot of family around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not have been at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have been off schedule just like
I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't put your Patreon questions in
the past few episodes because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to waste those questions and people
miss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why the Patreon stuff has been
getting skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next few episodes, we will focus
heavily on Patreon content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the people that did pay for those
questions, they won't miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get their answers and they also
got their time with their family during
[SPEAKER_00]: the holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made that nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that in another show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure you understand why
the Patreon questions have been getting
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into the main topic of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a quick show, but in the last
episode, I did talk about running our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants on an 18-6 light schedule at the
end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't listen to the last episode,
I'll recap that and tell you why I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us put our plants on a 12-12
flowering light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the lights are on for 12 hours
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're off for 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This triggers our plants to go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basic grow knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will do an 11-13 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 11-13 cycle, in my opinion,
in DJ Short's opinion as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: will give us better phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking for different phenotypes
from a package of seeds, we want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the variations from this seed and this
seed a little more defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 11-13 cycle, in my opinion,
in DJ's experience, will show us more
[SPEAKER_00]: variation, more potential from each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running a population of
plants, you may not want the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: grows real tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not want the one that's real short
and stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want the one that's right in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a phenohunt to find the one that is
perfect for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that 11-13 schedule, you may see more
expression from your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump to the 18-6 part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I recommend to turn our timer
back to 18-6 for the last seven to 10 days
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower is because light is the number
one source of energy for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light encourages growth, contributes to
all of the photosynthesis of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants are awake, they're
photosynthesizing, they're getting beefier
[SPEAKER_00]: and fatter, and they're growing with that
more light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go from 12-12 to 18-6, you're
getting six more hours of light every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that much more light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get bigger, they'll get beefier,
they'll get fatter, and also they may
[SPEAKER_00]: ripen up a little bit earlier because of
that extra light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people are gonna say,
won't that fuck my plants up if I run them
[SPEAKER_00]: on 18-6 at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants eventually will start to
revej, but we're flushing and preparing
[SPEAKER_00]: for harvest already, so if we see any sign
of that revej happening, we chop down
[SPEAKER_00]: right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that revej is going to take 14 to
20 days to begin the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut down 10 to 14 days in
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should never get to the point of revej.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's something that I should
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a phenohunt, don't do this
18-6 stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A phenohunt should be ran as a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that to be done scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time with a strain,
if you're doing a phenohunt, if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: never run this clone before, don't do the
18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to learn our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time we run them, we're just
getting introduced to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just met this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to learn it, see what it likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that 18-6 at the end because you
don't even know how long the plant should
[SPEAKER_00]: take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know when to initiate 18-6?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know when to initiate flush if
you don't even know how long these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: take to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a new plant, if it's a
seedling, if it's a clone, don't do a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of random experiments to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run your first plant under scientific
expectations, scientific conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything the same to your new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be growing a plant that could be
absolutely the best plant ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you did some experiment to it that
thwarted its growth, that slowed down its
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, and it was your fault that that
plant didn't get to the best it could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now you're gonna cull it because you
think it's a runt or you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one that did some weird shit to
it and caused that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give these plants the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the plants up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we do ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the plants the opportunity to shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat your new plants scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a regimen for new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try new experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think, I got these new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna switch to a different soil this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what to expect from that
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what to expect from those
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if those seeds grow like shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's that new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they grow amazingly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's that new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not have too many variables for new
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, don't expect too much from that
first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first run is not going to be gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are learning the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have quality plants,
a quality harvest, but that second and
[SPEAKER_00]: third run is when you're really looking to
reach goals and break limits and have
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first run, it's the first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect to, everybody doesn't put out
on the first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first date is not always successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a couple of dates, a couple of
experiences to get to know this lady and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure we satisfy this lady so that it
can satisfy us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to learn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're finding, we're looking for
phenotypes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running from seed, you could
have a male seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do a bunch of experiments and a
bunch of training and lollipopping to a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a boy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning the harvest times of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning nutrient preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need a lot of CalMag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need a lot of nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they get mad if you get them too much
CalMag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants don't want a lot of CalMag
later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to learn these plants the first
time we're running them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to learn temperature and
humidity and VPD preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some plants that want it really,
really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some plants that would prefer a
really moist climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some plants that I only water
every other time when I water the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden because they prefer a really,
really dry soil base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about learning that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a bunch of plants all at
once, can you learn each plant
[SPEAKER_00]: individually?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you really can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time you're running a plant,
let's focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a seedling, if it's a batch of
seeds, if it's a clone, let's focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: learning that plant before we do a bunch
of crazy tricks and shit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not get too scientific, too
experimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to learn when to harvest that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know when to start flushing
that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if you're gonna do 18.6,
how do you know when to start that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know any of that stuff the first
time we're running plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice to you is the first time
you're running it, build a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that plant show you what it wants to
do before you force things upon that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of times when it's the first
time I run a plant, if the breeder said
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be done in 60 days, I'm going to go
70.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna see what happens at the end of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of plants will beef up at the end of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put on that extra bit of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we add that 18.6 once we know the
plant and we can get that extra,
[SPEAKER_00]: extra bit of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you know what the plant does
naturally if we don't run it once without
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a bunch of tricks and crazy weird
shit to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that plant be itself, let it grow for
the phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've selected a keeper,
then you can manipulate it, you can fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, you can do all of your weird
magic that you wanna do to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can impose your will on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first time let that plant show you
what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants frost up at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cut it down too early, if we don't
let that plant go that extra 10 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may not even know that it gets super
frosty at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants put on beautiful colors toward
the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cut it down at day 63 and that
color happens at day 70, you may never
[SPEAKER_00]: know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time you're running a plant,
I would recommend going a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer and not messing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go five, 10, maybe 12 extra days
based on what the breeder says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you wanna get this crop down,
but this is not the last crop you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is the first crop and
hopefully it's the first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that first date goes well,
you get a second date.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the third and fourth date, you've got
some sort of rapport, some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've learned each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not expect the plants to put out on
the first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn them, develop a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn what that plant wants so we can
satisfy that plant before we expect it to
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfy us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, the first time we're
running seeds, let's not veg them forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people running brand new seeds in
seven gallon pots and they flip it into
[SPEAKER_00]: flour after like 60 days of vegging and
they're pissed off that they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, we should have found out way before
then if we had males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste time and space and energy on
big ass plants if you don't even know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a male or a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first run should be a small test
phenohunt run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an audition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spend all your money, all your time,
all your energy, all your space on the
[SPEAKER_00]: very first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a successful way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to disappoint yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 10 seeds, probably five of
them are males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't put them in small pots and
identify the males early, you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five of them are gonna get eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe six of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people come up with three
females from a pack of 10 before it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about the numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely, you're gonna get 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect 50% of your plants to be cold
before we even get into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what if you got a bunch of junk?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna get five males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe you get five females,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got two phenotypes that are
gonna be like, oh man, those are the ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always one that's real tall,
one that's real short, one that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: real good, one that's super frosty,
and then one that's kind of got all the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits but you wish it had one trait a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always that gamble when it
comes to you know, hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to find the one that you want
is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the plant that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste a bunch of time growing males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste a bunch of time doing
experiments and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next time you run, that's when
we're going to start doing tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we're gonna start
manipulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the plant we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the keeper for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can do tricks to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let the plants show you who they are
before you start manipulating them in that
[SPEAKER_00]: first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's something that a lot of people
have been asking me a lot of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: about and I've kind of changed the
direction I go when I give advice on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, hey, I bought a pack
of this strain and they've got my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to say, which phenotype am I
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which phenotype you're
looking for because I don't know what kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of grow you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of smoke you're
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you may have a pack of lemon
jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of desirable phenotypes
in there but if I say you want the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that grows in 70 days, that smells like
lemon candy, that takes a lot of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and gets real tall, I may be setting you
up for failure because maybe your grow has
[SPEAKER_00]: a short ceiling height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the phenotype that I want is not
going to work in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole idea of buying a pack of
seeds and doing that phenohunt is finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go to dinner with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like spicy food and I drink a lot of
kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're into spicy food and
kombucha, you don't want me ordering your
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to the restaurant, we both
wanted Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we went to the Italian
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a guideline here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there's Italian food in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to narrow it down off the
menu and get the Italian food for me and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Italian food for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make me pick your Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I may pick white sauce and real
garlicky pasta and you may have just been
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the mood for a red sauce and
something a little more not garlicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, more acidic with that red sauce is
what you were in the mood for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may want completely different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both fall under the umbrella of
lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both fall under the umbrella of
Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make your selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me choose for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you recommendations and ideas of
what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that phenotype is not up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that takes 70 days to
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I like those longer finishing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they get a little more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they put on more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate a long flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're too impatient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need that 60 day finisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't rely on me to select a phenotype
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that screams and sings at you is
the one that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot like dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna find the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not the one for you, you guys will
let each other know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is the one for you, you're gonna
feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So base your phenotypical selections off
of the plants that work best for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: not best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of work to narrow down the
phenotypes that are gonna come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given you a lot of guidance on what
to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to select the phenotype
that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said this a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first run with the plants is an
audition run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the last run you get with
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we even get a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how the outcome goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the flowering cycle,
chop them down, smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be one in there that is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be four out of those 10 that
are useless to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know exactly which one you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that one again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we're going to start doing
all of the tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can run the 11-13 light
cycle if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can run the 18-6 light
cycle if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can lollipop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can trellis them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can work them into a net.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not waste all that time,
space, and energy on brand new plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't even know what we're messing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have all males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a bunch of hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a bunch of weird mutant
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could have amazing keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick rant on phenotypical
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna ramble on and add more to it
unnecessarily.
