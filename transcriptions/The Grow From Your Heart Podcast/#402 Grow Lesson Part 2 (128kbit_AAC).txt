by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www

[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of vanilla
cookies batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this concentrate has 79
percent THC and 94 point four percent
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to tell you the truth, I am nicely
medicated from this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a nice, really heavy buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me nice and mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be another
compilation of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a repost of episodes
three fifty nine, three sixty,
[SPEAKER_00]: three sixty two, three sixty three,
sixty four and three sixty five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's jump right back in to a long
[SPEAKER_00]: group of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode three fifty nine of
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that they have a whole lot of
packaging company out there.
They have about a hundred salespeople out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the whole packaging process,
and it is completely useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after they've put the jar in that
bag, they place that bag inside of another
[SPEAKER_00]: box which slides into another box,
which is all beautifully decorated and
[SPEAKER_00]: well labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lot of packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most of that packaging is because
of the Colorado compliance laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would like to see less packaging
from the concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I throw away a lot of
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, so let me be
completely clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubble jack full spectrum extract
tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only complaint is with the packaging
and that is not just Fuego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happen to be using Fuego products
today when I'm talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the companies are using too much
packaging and I understand it's Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish there was a way we could do
this more efficiently and more
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's move forward
with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the seventh lesson in
a long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I want to talk about
planning your integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes to think they will not get
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes to say that's not going to
happen to me, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you can prevent it is by
starting an integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: system while you're planning your grow,
while you're setting up your grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: having it in place before you ever
introduce plants into your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit about
integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the goal of our integrated pest
management system?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ultimate goal is to keep our garden
free of pests and bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good spot to start would be knowing how
to identify the bugs we are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: and the damage that they will leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what insects are we going to find in
our cannabis garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common problem we are going to
find is spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites are very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very unlikely to see a spider mite
unless you flip over a leaf and look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and do some investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will see is spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a leaf that looks like
somebody has just been taking a needle and
[SPEAKER_00]: poking little dots in that leaf or
something's been sticking its fangs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and sucking the juice out of those
little spots, that is spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to identify spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see damage on a leaf, pull that
leaf off, flip it upside down and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the underside of the leaf along the main
vein of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of that leaf, tucked right up against that
vein, you will see spider mites and spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mite eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little dots you see, those are
spider mite eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little itty bitty dots that are
moving, those are the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to treat for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what cycle of growth you are
in, treating for spider mites can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be kind of a pain in the ass
later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you learn how to identify spider mite
damage and learn how to identify spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, finding the problem early and
correcting it should not be a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: before it gets out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another pest that is very common in the
garden and very easy to identify because
[SPEAKER_00]: of its damage is a thrip.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot like a spider mite, the thrips like
to suck the juice out of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: After they do this, they leave a little
trail of gooey stuff called honeydew on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a little trail of silvery shiny
shimmery stuff left on your lower leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably have thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we become familiar with what thrip
damage looks like, we can identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem sooner and that makes it really
easy to eradicate our problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is knowing what to look for
will be seriously advantageous when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to treating for a pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common pest you're going to run
into is the white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does a white fly look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little piece of ash just
flying around, just a little white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start off with two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next day you'll see 200 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next day you'll see 2,000 of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flies multiply rapidly, but once you
see them, they are easy to get rid of if
[SPEAKER_00]: you understand how to combat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very first step of an integrated
pest management system is learning to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the damage caused by common
garden pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we know how to identify the problems,
then we can identify the pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can decide on the course of action
to treat that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it is very important to treat for
the correct pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pesticides will work on a broad
spectrum of pests, but if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: specific pesticides or if you're using
specific predatory pests, you do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: use the correct method of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's market, we can't afford to
spend money on a product that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically attack our problem,
and also we can't spend time applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: product or releasing predators that are
not going to get in there and eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: our problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn how to identify the signs,
then identify the actual pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can dial in an attack to eradicate
our problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a few ways we can
prepare our grow and prevent pests from
[SPEAKER_00]: entering our new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is a huge factor when it comes
to keeping bugs out of our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that goes in that garden is
taken in there by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You travel in and out of there,
you take things in and out, it is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility to control what goes in and
out of that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to prevent contaminating your
garden is to have dedicated garden
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come from a hike, don't come from
the grow store, don't come from work,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go from wherever you are into your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have specific garden clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your clothes, change your shoes,
change your hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take your daily clothing into your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what's on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've been petting a dog,
maybe the dog was outside leaning against
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree, maybe that tree had aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dog came in, rubbed up against your leg,
you and the dog spent a minute together
[SPEAKER_00]: scratching on each other, then you went to
the grow, you just took those aphids from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree to the dog into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to prevent that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks down to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrap my dreadlocks up in a specific hat
before I go into any grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got dreadlocks or long hair,
I suggest you put it in a hat of some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort, maybe a hairnet, whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hair would not fit in a hairnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrap my dreads in a big bun on top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrap that in a piece of material that
wraps real tight, then I slide a dreadlock
[SPEAKER_00]: hat over that so I'm double wrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will get in, nothing will get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't transfer any problems from grow to
grow or room to room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got dreadlocks or long hair,
I highly recommend you keep it wrapped up
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in a hairnet or something similar,
maybe a dread hat just where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: contained in there and not exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can prevent moving spider
mites around through your hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys with the big beards,
you may want to consider a beardnet also,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just to prevent the bugs from getting
into our hair, but also to prevent our
[SPEAKER_00]: hair from sticking to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to buy a bud with a big hair
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your clothes, keep your hair tied
up, and then let's get back to that dog I
[SPEAKER_00]: was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend having pets in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of pictures of people with
their dog or their cat in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it's their guard dog or
their mascot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool if you want to do that,
but I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, your dog or your cat
goes outside, it rolls around in the dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: it rolls around in the bushes,
it just goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what it's getting into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you let it walk right into the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it walked up right up against a
plant that was covered in spider mites and
[SPEAKER_00]: you had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that dog is in your garden rubbing up
against your plants, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Free spider mites for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend having a pet in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist, do your thing, that is your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, that is a huge risk for
bringing bugs into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I would recommend is that if
you've got an outdoor grow and an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, don't bring your tools from that
outdoor grow into your indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be bringing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I know I sound like I might
just be paranoid, but it's better to be
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoid than to make stupid mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as long as you're changing your
clothes, you're keeping your hair clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're keeping your shoes and your
equipment clean, and you're not letting
[SPEAKER_00]: your dog or your friends in your grow
room, there shouldn't be a way for any
[SPEAKER_00]: pests to get into this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have some cracks in the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be gaps in your building.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always going to happen,
but we're not going to drag them in there
[SPEAKER_00]: on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they find a way in, we will deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you're certain you've minimized
the opportunity for pests to enter your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow through your own doing, we need to
think about treating the clones that come
[SPEAKER_00]: into our grow before they are introduced
to population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever your clones come from,
if it's your best friend, if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, if it's some guy on Instagram,
wherever they came from, treat them as if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are contaminated with some sort of
pest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never introduce clones into your general
population without some sort of quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room is brand new, you don't have
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why take plants in there that have bugs on
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can treat those plants before we take
them into our main grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a room with plants going,
why would you want to introduce a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with bugs on it into that room to
contaminate the entire grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get clones from anybody,
isolate them, quarantine them,
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate them, get a jeweler's loop and
go over the leaves and see if you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: any signs of bugs on the top or bottoms of
those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any pests, now you have to
decide if you want to keep that clone or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to treat it and try to
eradicate that problem before you
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce that clone to your general
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got a clone that had bugs on it,
I would probably throw it away unless it
[SPEAKER_00]: were some super elite cut that I could
never get again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why start with problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even allow that to make it past
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looked like it was clean,
I would still probably treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would treat it with whatever pest
management system I have decided to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using sprays and oils, I would
heavily treat it with multiple oils
[SPEAKER_00]: several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably spend a week in
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first day it would get blasted with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day three, it would get blasted with
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day five, something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel like it's safe and clean,
it may enter general population on day
[SPEAKER_00]: seven or it may get treated one more time,
depending on how it looks to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were working in a facility that did
not use spray applications, I would put
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant in an isolated area with enough
light and living conditions to survive for
[SPEAKER_00]: a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would start heavily applying
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would build up a colony of predators on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they would go through and eat
anything that was causing me a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by day seven, I would be safe to enter
that clone into general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, if I got a clone and it was
contaminated, I probably would just
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't even make it past the
inspection stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't even get into my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, it is your responsibility
to check incoming clones and check them
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly, no matter where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came from your best friend,
if it came from a dispensary, if it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from somebody on the internet,
it is your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot blame anybody for giving you a
clone with bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat any incoming plants as if they
are contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolate them, treat them and continue to
monitor them until you are certain the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is not there or has been
eradicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another very common way for people to
get garden pests is through store bought
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people try to blame specific
brands for being infested with specific
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand A is made in one area in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand B is probably made in another area
of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brand C will just say that it's
manufactured in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of those brands are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're all shipped to a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these warehouses store their
soil in pallets outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if one of those pallets had a little
bit of bugs in it, they started thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: in that one pallet of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are in brands A, B and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way to blame a specific soil
company for giving you bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably the warehouse in which all
of those pallets were stored is where your
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to get away from blaming a
specific brand for having specific bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unfair and probably inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a fact that our soil does come
with bugs quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll notice this when
you're transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll stick your hand in there and a
little bug will just fly right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a fungus gnat or a white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just fly right up out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to start thinking about how
you're going to treat for those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times you don't see those soil borne
pests until the first time you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just potted all those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a whole bag worth of soil worth of
pots done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeling really good about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the grow room all organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that first batch of water that hits
that soil, you see little bugs come flying
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are fresh bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came fresh with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not a big deal as long as we know
how to identify the insect and we know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to properly treat for that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treating for soil borne pests is very
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either purchase predator insects
that will get in there and eat that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can mix up a root drench which is a
basic pesticide and you mix it with water
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you water that into the plants
just like you would when you normally
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that pesticide gets down in there in
the root zone and then it will eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: any pests that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things you're most commonly going to
find in soil are going to be white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably find some fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I quite often have found thrips in my
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know that your soil may have bugs
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be looking and be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you see some pests, identify
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start thinking about eradication
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan on giving you options for
eradication strategies, but I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countless options and variables
when it comes to deciding your integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to give you guidance to let you
decide and modify your own pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: system to where it fits with your grow
style, with your grow environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also it's got to fit your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you a good guideline
on how to take care of pests in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, but it is up to you to implement
and modify these practices to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've covered most of the ways that we
are going to introduce pests into a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the other ways pests are
going to find their way into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come in through your
venting and your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any spots that are not sealed
up, a spider mite or a little bug could
[SPEAKER_00]: just wiggle its way right through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell that sweet ganja
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to feel that warmth from the
light and it's going to go, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to just go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to tell all of its
friends, Hey bro, I found a way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just going to start parading
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any cracks or gaps in your structure
need to be sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a gap or a crack or a hole
of some sort, put some caulk in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some tape over it, seal it up super
tight so that the bugs cannot get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's ideal to have a completely sealed
room, but I understand that that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: always a viable option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we do have the opportunity to get
bugs in there, our next step is to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to monitor and indicate the presence
of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest way and most affordable
and cost-effective way to do that is first
[SPEAKER_00]: by scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to spend time every day looking
through your garden to see if you see any
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of bugs or bug damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scouting for bugs is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of your grow,
this could take anywhere from five minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: to a full hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is important work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some good music, get in the zone
and scout for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train everybody in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to identify signs of pests and also
teach them how to identify which pests
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do discover pests, have a way to
mark the plant and also mark on paper
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have row numbers or room
numbers, or if it's just a home grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: just plant number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the plant in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of mark down roughly where it is
and then start thinking of a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not the one in charge of pest
management, make sure you report that to
[SPEAKER_00]: the person above you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make a note of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what you found, what it looks
like, what pest you think it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then start doing research on how do we
eradicate that pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start coming up with options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scouting for bugs is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn the leaves upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look low in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look high in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to pull a few leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get a good look, reach in
there, pop off a few leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those under your scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be scouting for pests on a
regular basis with some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're out scouting for pests,
you should check your yellow sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grow should have yellow sticky cards
and they should be checked frequently and
[SPEAKER_00]: change frequently as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky cards are exactly what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little yellow cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about four inches by four inches
or maybe four inches by six inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are bright yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a disgusting glue on them that
if you touch it, it's going to take all
[SPEAKER_00]: day to get that stuff off of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get one stuck to your elbow when
you're working in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done it, you know exactly what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do it, you'll go, ah,
that's what he meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you should have yellow sticky traps
all over the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put yellow sticky traps low down
by the soil so that if I get any soil
[SPEAKER_00]: bound pests coming up out of the dirt,
I get indicators of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put yellow sticky traps low in
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get any low flying stuff,
I get indicators of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put stuff at the top of the canopy
and then I'll also put stuff up near the
[SPEAKER_00]: light so that if anything flies into it,
I get an indicator of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a really easy way to find out
that you have got insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs love those yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, wow, look how bright that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a leaf that is weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a leaf that's got a weak surface
that I can get in there and really start
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking the juice out of without a lot of
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bugs run to that yellow sticky trap
and they go, ah, shit, this is yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stuck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come in in the morning and we
get to find out what kind of bugs were
[SPEAKER_00]: messing around in the garden, having a
party while we were at home trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky traps are really affordable
and they are a really early indicator of
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang up your sticky traps, check them
on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing things stuck to them,
investigate what that pest is and treat
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hang up fresh sticky traps and see if
that problem has gone away or if it has
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten worse or if anything new pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to use the yellow
sticky traps, there has to be some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: method to your madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hang them strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to check them and you have to
replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see something, you have to
react accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have two methods of finding bugs
in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use our own vision from scouting
and then we can use yellow sticky traps to
[SPEAKER_00]: assist us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next step is to learn to use our
integrated pest management system to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to prevent infestations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need to learn what to do if a
pest infestation should occur in a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategic pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always wise to have preventative
measures in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wait until we've got bugs to start
treating for bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it uncomfortable and
undesirable for the pests we know may
[SPEAKER_00]: arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we talk about options,
let's talk a little bit about ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose organic sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose harsh chemical sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you choose to treat your garden
is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to use something safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to your pets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it overall safe to our environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to smoke it yourself,
spray whatever you are comfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying on your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably don't want to smoke it if you
sprayed it with a few things, but if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: yours and you're sure it's not going
anywhere, you can treat it however you are
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have other consumers that are going
to consume your product, keep their health
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody is a young, healthy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may have underlying health
issues that may be exacerbated by a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide or an essential oil or a
botanical oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep other people in mind if you are going
to share, sell, or dispense your product
[SPEAKER_00]: in any sort of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, please make sure that
your pest management system is
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to keep in mind the long-term
effects of whatever we choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial mites will have a long-term
environmental effect, but it is a much
[SPEAKER_00]: gentler effect than if we went outside and
sprayed harsh chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about exposure, not just to the
plants, the environment, the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: your neighbor's gardens, but also to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to apply those chemicals or
pesticides or botanical oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about if they're going to harm you
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about, this is something we
don't think about often enough here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm trying to gear myself more toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the ethics of the company that
makes the products you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that company care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they care about the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they care about people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they care about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they opposed to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some companies out there that
make products that are available at the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro store that are completely opposed to
cannabis and cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we buy those products to support
those people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to selecting a pesticide,
understand the company, understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: product you're buying, understand the
active ingredient, and understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of that ingredient in the long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what it's doing to yourself,
understand what it's doing to your
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, and try to understand what it
does to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really think about if that's
something you can support, if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you would be proud to say you
did, if that is something you would stand
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're proud of it, if you can
support it and you'd put your signature on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, go ahead and use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit more about
preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was headed with all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preventative measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to start treating for a pest
problem before you see a pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't we go ahead and make an
undesirable environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are easy ways to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: An easy way to do that is to already apply
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not start a colony of beneficial bugs
in our garden before the bad bugs even
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chance to take hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start getting your persimilis,
your swarskies, whatever you decide to use
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little bit of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you order the proper bugs
that work for your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your temperature and humidity will play a
huge factor in the bugs that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get some predators in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the army established and get them
started before the bad guys can even get
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another route you can take is by
spraying pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your essential oils,
your botanical oils, or you can use your
[SPEAKER_00]: light or heavy chemical sprays,
whatever you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start applying them before you see
an insect infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if a bug does try to creep down
the ducting, it jumps on the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes off the ducting, and it doesn't
want to be here at all and it just tries
[SPEAKER_00]: to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't invite its friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create that undesirable
environment before you even get an
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with a schedule and a
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide that you're going to spray every so
often and then decide that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate your products this frequently and
then set a schedule and a routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you see anything, you can step
up your game accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about scheduling and
strategy a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say we have been scouting and we
have been doing our preventative sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: and now we have discovered some pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do we treat them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the first step?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is to correctly identify
your pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a commercial scale, it would save a lot
of time and energy to treat for the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct pest the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is to correctly identify
our pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to think about how do we
want to treat this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to use predators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to use horticultural oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to use botanical sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to get in there with essential
oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we want to step up our game and
start using light pesticides or maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we have to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the essential oils and the hippie
products aren't going to get rid of a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you'll need to step up to a
mild pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the pesticides are organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a serious infestation and
you don't want to deal with some organic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you can step your way up to more
harsh chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, those are toxic and they
become dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to think about the ethics of
what you are giving to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're trying to stay more organic,
if you're doing a TLO sort of setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can introduce predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predators are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to have specific insects to
battle specific insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just release one thing and
expect it to go take care of any bug that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predators are an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get out there and let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They either come in sachets or they come
in a bottle with like a little spout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let them out somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be dispersed through the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are time consuming, but they are
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 100% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not applying anything to the garden
that's going to change the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not putting any chemicals on there
that may make anybody else sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you found a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You identified the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done some research on products that
will help you get rid of that pest to
[SPEAKER_00]: either beneficial bugs or pesticide
sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've decided to apply that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, if we apply the same
product to a pest too many times,
[SPEAKER_00]: those bugs will develop a resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll spray for that bug again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll think it's gone a couple of weeks
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll spray twice as hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back and it won't show up for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does come back, you won't be able
to spray it down with the product you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been using before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to prevent that, I recommend using
multiple modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget that if the pesticides
work together and don't cause a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: problem together and don't disrupt the
plant health, you can mix more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide in a tank together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode about it titled Tank
Mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to mix multiple products
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mix your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give it a good shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say give it two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then apply a different mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you still see the presence of
bugs, apply a different mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go at it with the same product over
and over because they will develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, I said we would talk about
scheduling and strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a more scheduled and
detailed integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a quick rundown of my scheduling
and my strategy for pest management in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, everything I mentioned is approved by
the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: Division and also the Colorado Department
of Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot apply a pesticide that is on the
banned list or that has not been approved
[SPEAKER_00]: for use in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I'm using is approved by the
state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to start my pest management system,
every Monday, I apply a specific pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen to all of my vegetative plants,
my small veg, my large veg, my mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and the clones that are rooted and
in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all get sprayed with a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of the plant,
I may spray them with a little more potent
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may spray them with a lighter mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may spray with just one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may mix up multiple products at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every Monday, those plants are getting
treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also write down exactly what I sprayed
on each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, next week, I know I can switch
my pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can spray something different next week
to prevent a resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that my plants have got a
protective barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little protection going on to
prevent from getting pests in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using lighter sprays,
if you're using botanical oils or
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils, you may want to up your
spray regimen to twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those things don't stick around very
long, you may want to apply them more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a weekly spray schedule in place
and try to switch up your products so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can prevent your pests from building
any type of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're in there applying the
sprays, spray the undersides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the spider mites are on the
underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not spray there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So start at the bottom of the plant and
start spraying the underside of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: and work your way up the plant to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will saturate the entire grow this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to cover all of the plants just to the
point of runoff, right to when they start
[SPEAKER_00]: dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific products will have specific
guidelines, but I recommend you spray
[SPEAKER_00]: right to where they start running off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to saturate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave any desirable space for a
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and spray once,
maybe twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do this throughout the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we start approaching the flower
phase, we need to think about what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do for pest management during the
bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a typical commercial grow, I would
generally apply approved pesticides until
[SPEAKER_00]: day 14 or 15 of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go in there the first day of the
third week and hit that room one last time
[SPEAKER_00]: if I've had any problems, just to make
sure those bugs aren't coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have any buds building yet,
if you're just starting to get bud set,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be okay with one final spray if
you were selective with your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you haven't seen any bugs,
you can taper off your spray application
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we can start to introduce
our beneficial and predator insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the beneficial insects work just like
pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to reapply them at specified
intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the vendors that provide live bugs
are willing to set you up on a schedule to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you will receive the same order
every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you can rely on it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show up at the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, hey, look, they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to hang them because
they're right there in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to get yourself on a
good regimen and a good schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: in a good regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to get yourself on a
good regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to get yourself on a
good regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you've got them in flower,
they are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to start getting rid of them
and having a clean grow before we move
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I've mentioned, once we get
past week three, we can't really spray
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only treat them with bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes time to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus on getting the plants clean
and pest free before we even move them to
[SPEAKER_00]: that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people try to focus on the
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get those pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are on their way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go all the way to the beginning and
get the mother plants very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the source material clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work on keeping the clones clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn how to get the veg room
immaculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, when we move into the flower
room, we don't have to battle bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to battle pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can focus on building those fat,
juicy buds and delicious trichomes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I do recommend is write
down all of your sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working in a commercial grow,
you were required to write down all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write down the date,
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to write down the name of
every product and the EPA number of every
[SPEAKER_00]: product and the amount of every product
that you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write down the REI of each
product that you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write down the lot number of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of documenting to be done in
a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you do the same thing in your
private grow, just for peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to have records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do end up working in a
commercial grow, you've already got
[SPEAKER_00]: experience writing down what you've been
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm sure there are a lot of people
that will not agree with my pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: spray application regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that people have different
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the method that I use in a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what has been proven to work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been proven to be cost effective,
and it is something that I can train other
[SPEAKER_00]: employees to do on a repeatable basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all other aspects of growing
cannabis, the options for integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management are endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as it's making you happy,
as long as you are satisfied with the
[SPEAKER_00]: results, keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, that is my quick
talk on integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I didn't recommend any products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't recommend any specific vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not recommend any brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to give you an idea of how to
start your own custom tailored integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know what to expect and you've got
a few options on how to prevent and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can customize that program to work
for your grow, your budget and your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any questions or comments

[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Bubble Jack FSC
from Fuego Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor just lingers on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little information printed on
the side of the package here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lab test that says 71.83% max
THC, 2.85% CBGA, and it's got 9.98%
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bubblegum cotton candy flavor that
just lingers on the tongue is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that head high that goes straight
to the brain and keeps you rambling,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps you motivated is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a big two thumbs up to the Bubble Jack
Full Spectrum Extract from Fuego Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy smoking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's keep moving
this show forward because I have got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get back into the grow
lessons on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the eighth lesson in a
long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we've talked about our goals and
ideas and where to set up our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone over the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about our containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about soil and medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not caught up, I recommend
you go back to episode 351 and start
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of interruptions in the
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will sneak in a few episodes that are
not grow lessons while I'm doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll need to read emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll need to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up, we're going to have some iTunes
customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that will disrupt the lessons,
but I think it keeps the shows fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me motivated and it keeps it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this episode, we will continue the
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's talk about
a couple of things I kind of overlooked
[SPEAKER_00]: while we were talking about building our
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a good idea to add a smoke
detector to each grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you've got a grow light hanging,
have a smoke detector in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend a fire
extinguisher outside of each grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I hope you don't have to use it,
but if that smoke alarm goes off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would rather have that fire
extinguisher outside of the grow room so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to open the door,
run in there, get the fire extinguisher,
[SPEAKER_00]: then start working on the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's outside of the grow room,
you can just grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be a little more prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start putting out the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've never used a fire
extinguisher, maybe read the instructions,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe understand what to do in case of a
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just read that little book that
comes with it and also make sure it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a gauge on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a red, a yellow and a green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your little arrow is in the
green at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to think about some sort of
automated fire suppression system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make things that hang in the middle
of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little heat sensor in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too hot, it basically explodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It releases a powder that rains down into
the grow room that will put out any fire
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about some sort of way to detect and
suppress a fire in your grow room should
[SPEAKER_00]: that situation occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I overlooked when we were
designing and building our room was an
[SPEAKER_00]: automated watering or an assisted watering
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: An automated watering system can really
speed things up once you get into a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes the plants really happy
because the plants love consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in designing an auto
watering system, I did a full episode
[SPEAKER_00]: about auto watering on episode 335.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there were some audio
technical difficulties and parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode chop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to that episode and you
still have specific questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: get your auto water system dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so at this point, we should
have goals and reasonable expectations for
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good idea of where we
want to put the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good idea of the gear we
want to buy, the lights, the pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should also have a good idea of pest
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've talked a little bit about fire
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also done an in-depth episode on fire
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is episode 260.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn a lot about fire
safety in your grow, episode number 260
[SPEAKER_00]: will teach you a lot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide you want to add an auto
watering system to your grow, episode 335
[SPEAKER_00]: is the episode all about auto watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should get us all caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the gear planned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good idea of pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what we're going to feed the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to take care of a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to set up an auto watering
system if we need one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting to the fun part of this
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start thinking about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to dedicate your time,
your energy, your space, and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money to over the next 90 to 120 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: What strains have gotten your attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: What strains do you really enjoy smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does something work for you medically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does something work for you
recreationally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something that is reliable that
every time you smoke it, you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: desired effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to fall back to the very
first episode of this grow lesson series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing this for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing it for a medical patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of things to think about
when it comes to deciding what strains to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: In legal, medical, and recreational
states, we have a lot more options for
[SPEAKER_00]: acquiring genetic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to a dispensary and buy a clone
off of the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to our friend's garden and ask
them for clones, and they can give,
[SPEAKER_00]: sell, or trade those clones to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can acquire clones here very easily in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I went to a dispensary just a few
days ago to pick up these Fuego extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had two different variety of
clones on the shelf that looked very
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Purple Punch and Dosey Dose on
the shelf, ready to go at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clones are readily available in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are also available in some Colorado
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk right into the store,
you can grab a pack of seeds, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start your new garden from seeds you
picked up at your local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones and seeds are both viable options
for starting a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to focus on the
great debate on seeds versus clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into that, let's talk a
little bit about how you can decide what
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do that is to smoke a
bunch of different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a medical or
recreational state, that is a lot easier
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you were in Prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Prohibition land,
who knows if the strain you were buying is
[SPEAKER_00]: even really what whoever is selling it to
you is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably growing something and
they're calling everything cookies because
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with the letters OG at the end of
it sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably got something cookies
OG, anything with the word fire in there
[SPEAKER_00]: works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably, you guys are probably
buying fire cookies OG in Prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably whatever that person got a
clone of or whatever that person's buying
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk of and they're just renaming it
because they know that names are hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a Prohibition state, it's going to
be a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get a seed in your bag of
weed one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always grow out those bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you find phenotypes very close
to what you started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes you find hermaphrodites
and problematic plants, so be prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it is your only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always an awkward situation asking a
grower for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: For clones, if you're a new grower and
you're buying herb from somebody and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, bro, I really love this
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think I could get a clone that
always presents an awkward situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, now you both know you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a Prohibition state,
that makes things really weird for both of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the guy doesn't want to release his
genetics to you because now he's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose a customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're on a really friendly
basis with your weed guy, I would avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in a legal state, in a recreational or
a medical state, it's really easy to go
[SPEAKER_00]: find out what strains work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the dispensary and you buy as
many grams as you can afford of different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and you go home and you smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start fresh every day and you try this
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't smoked this one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke strain A and you take a few
notes and you see how it works for you
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a target, if you're trying
to make your leg pain go away,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're trying to make your headache go
away, if you're trying to make your back
[SPEAKER_00]: pain go away, if you're trying to make
your anxiety go away, document the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of which that ailment starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a five?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that at a 10?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I started off with a level five leg
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a bowl of this strain A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my leg pain is at a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, I woke up, leg pain's at a
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked strain B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my leg pain is still at a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously don't want to buy any more of
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to go the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day number three, I woke up, my leg pain's
at a six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm at a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one might work well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put a little star by that and
remember what this is and then just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: doing little tests like that on yourself
and with the flowers and find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: strain works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a strain at one dispensary
that works very well for you, try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: it at another dispensary and smoke that
product because they have different
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have different clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their product is going to come out very
different in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we start with the same clone,
two commercial grows will produce two very
[SPEAKER_00]: different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try them both and see if it's the
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've just been that one batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've just been that one grow,
but try different batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds like I'm completely
spoiled, but this is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can drive to 10 dispensaries in my area
and probably five of them have wedding
[SPEAKER_00]: cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wedding cake was probably grown
by three different grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you if I try all three of them,
they're all going to have very subtle
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will taste a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to burn a little different and
one's going to have a better high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're all going to have that wedding
cake droopy eye giggly kind of thing going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to check them out from different
grows if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it's the strain and not
just that one grower that did it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to loop back on,
we talked about trying to get a clone from
[SPEAKER_00]: your grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do try to buy a clone from your
grower friend, don't be offended when he
[SPEAKER_00]: hits you with a really steep price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been selling you herb for how long
and now you're going to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much money are you taking out of his
pocket?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're going to save that much
money, but that guy's been relying on you
[SPEAKER_00]: as a customer and now you're going to try
to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to go, dude, this guy's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put a fat chunk in his
pocket as a parting gift when he gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he needs so much for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he's the only one growing that in
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he's living.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he's making his income.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to buy it into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That genetic is going to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does he know you're not going to run a
bunch of it and flood the town with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they hit you with a really high
price for a clone in a prohibition state,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because that's how that person is
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is his income.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably phenohunted that or he paid
a whole lot of money for that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's sharing his revenue stream with
you and kind of opening up the floodgates
[SPEAKER_00]: to put himself out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you guys do a phenohunt and you've
found your own keeper, you'll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: understand a little bit more, especially
in a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, we've talked a little
bit about deciding what you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to grow is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you decide what you want to grow,
if you pick something that takes 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and it grows tall and skinny,
if that's really what you think you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow, you're going to have to adapt to
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to make that plant adapt to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of notes, but I don't
have a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just jump right into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the debate on seeds
versus clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've decided what you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you want to grow it from seed or
from clone growing from either seed or
[SPEAKER_00]: clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have their advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you'll have to think about with
both of them is availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are clones available where you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does somebody in your area grow that is
willing to release clones to you for your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a dispensary in your area that
sells clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read correctly, in Canada,
you can ship clones to each other through
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if nobody has clones near you,
they are not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if somebody does have clones,
are they accurately labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the variety you're looking
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the same story with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know somebody that's got seeds that
is willing to share some with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get them from somebody,
are they accurately labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they have the variety that you're
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the advantages of seeds is that
there are shops on the Internet that will
[SPEAKER_00]: send seeds directly to your mailbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a prohibition state and you
order seeds from an online vendor,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is your responsibility to keep those
seeds in the packaging and do not allow
[SPEAKER_00]: them to grow if it is illegal to grow them
in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save them as souvenirs and collectibles
until legalization happens in your area or
[SPEAKER_00]: until you move to a legalized state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are several online vendors who
will send you seeds to keep as
[SPEAKER_00]: collectibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to germinate those and
grow those yourself, that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that happens from that is up to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seeds are available online and seeds
don't die in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to do a friendly debate on
clone versus seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to keep it fair, we need to act like
there is a place where we can go that has
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and seeds available in just about
any variety we could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the strain that you chose you
want to grow for your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's imagine there's a dispensary where
we can go and they've got flowers of that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain grown by three different growers so
we can smoke it from three different
[SPEAKER_00]: people and make sure it's what we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got extra extracts there,
so if you're into smoking concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got full spectrum extract,
they've got shatter, they've got wax,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got whatever you're into that way
so you can make sure that's the strain you
[SPEAKER_00]: desire for your concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, they have got seeds and clones
of your favorite strain ready for you
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to buy seeds or clones for
your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start a friendly debate right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I get too far into this,
let me give a quick explanation on what a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure most people know what a
seed is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bean that grows into a big
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone is basically a photocopy of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a cutting off of a plant and it
roots and now we have a photocopy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are annuals, which means
they only live for one year or one cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow it from seed, it produces bud,
we harvest it, it is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: By taking a clone, we can have that plant
again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can have repeatable, reliable
outcomes and a reliable product from each
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a clone is basically a genetic
photocopy of a reliable plant in the form
[SPEAKER_00]: of just a tiny little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about clones and we'll talk
about phenohunting a lot more as these
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about some of the pros and
cons of seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros of growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best parts about growing from
seed is there are no bugs and no
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get free powdery mildew with
your new clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All too often, people give out clones that
are infested with spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: with russet mites, with aphids,
with thrips, or with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an option with a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's also put that in the cons
category when it comes to growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the disadvantages of starting from
clones is that they may come with bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about one of my favorite
parts about growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing from seed allows me to find custom
tailored phenotypes that work perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: for what I'm looking for medically and
perfectly for what I'm looking for in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows the height I want it to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows for as long as I want it to grow
and it gives me medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the effect that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing from seed allows me to find
something completely unique for myself
[SPEAKER_00]: that works perfectly for my garden and my
medical needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The con to that is it does take time for
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to run the batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to find the plant that works for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there was one in that batch that
was exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I keep searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the downside to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will do an episode on phenohunting
in the future that is lined up in this
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the advantages is that I can
find perfectly custom tailored phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that work for myself and my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The con to that is that it does take time
for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to run the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to grow them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to dry them, cure them,
smoke them and see which ones I enjoyed,
[SPEAKER_00]: see which ones I didn't enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when I run a 10 pack, I find two
or three that I want to run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll repeat the process and eliminate
it to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that does take time, money and energy
to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there may be males, there may be
hermaphrodites and there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable phenotypes in that test run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the quality of the seeds
and the experience of the breeder and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of the work, I may not find the
phenotype I'm looking for in a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take more than 10 seeds to find the
desirable phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I've got reliable seeds and the
breeder did his work and I've done my job
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, I may find something in there
that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may find something in there that
nobody else has, which will set me apart
[SPEAKER_00]: from the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing for production to put on
the street, having a very unique strain
[SPEAKER_00]: would set me apart from the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got the frostiest, dankest strain
on the market, people are going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy that first, which means I'm going to
make more sales, which means maybe I can
[SPEAKER_00]: charge a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that perfectly selected
phenotype that grows exactly the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to, it grows perfectly for my grow
and it works perfect for my area,
[SPEAKER_00]: for my market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great advantage of growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of growing from seed is
that there is a huge variety available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we talked about this imaginary
store where everything is available,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not like that in all places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seed banks online that make
many, many varieties of seeds from very
[SPEAKER_00]: many reputable breeders available to
people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed availability is a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody can get their hands on
clean, reliable, accurately labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to order seeds from a seed
bank is definitely advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the downside to that is seeds can be
kind of expensive depending on the vendor
[SPEAKER_00]: and the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds can have a huge markup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're working with regular seeds,
you may lose 60% of your crop right when
[SPEAKER_00]: you switched to flower because you're
going to have male plants to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buying seeds can get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also need to have a reliable
breeder and a reputable vendor so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you are getting what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus more on growing from
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the advantages or pros of
growing from a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: If properly selected, that clone is a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: If properly selected, that clone is known
to put out high potency and to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: without any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that being said, we have to rely on a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the cons of growing from
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to grow the seeds and find
the keeper plants out of those seed
[SPEAKER_00]: packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they chose the stellar keeper to
pass on as clones to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dispensary, what usually happens is
I'll cut 120 clones for my next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only need a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually send those 20 to the store
so that I don't have to throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them on a manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send them to the store and those are
made available.
[SPEAKER_00]: For shoppers in the retail store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're buying a clone from a
dispensary and it's accurately labeled,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably getting the same exact cut
as they're growing and putting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know that those clones have been
properly phenohunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that those clones are proven
females with proven potency and have
[SPEAKER_00]: proven themselves to be resistant to bugs
and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the advantage to growing from a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage to that is who knows who
selected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just getting it from some dude
on Craigslist, who knows how discerning
[SPEAKER_00]: his eye was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe his idea of amazing bud and your
idea of amazing bud are two completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when working with a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of working with a clone
is we have an idea of what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said before, somebody phenohunted
this clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've grown it out a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that it's going to have high
potency, either high CBD, high THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a beautiful ratio of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an idea of what type of
growth patterns to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get real tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get real bushy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to stretch out real bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to need a lot of water?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a good idea of how long it
will take to finish because our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and partners have probably grown this cut
several times before they gave it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main advantage to growing from
clone is that you've got a proven female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about calling
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant you put in there is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested for vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if we need sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if we need trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how often to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if we can overfeed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if it likes a high or a low pH,
and we already know how many days to let
[SPEAKER_00]: it flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge advantage from working
with a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can always call the guy and say,
hey, bro, this plant's doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen this strain do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll say, oh yeah, man, I grew that
like 10 times before I gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably just need more Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got some sort of history,
some sort of experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can help you diagnose a problem if
one does arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge advantage of working with
a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one disadvantage, the number
one con to bringing clones into your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden is most of the time they are
infested with bugs and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grower likes to say, my grow is
immaculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a single bug in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine times out of 10, those guys are
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that boast most about having the
pest free garden are the ones that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know the pests are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that say, no, I've got a little
bit of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the guys that are paying
attention, that are actually checking and
[SPEAKER_00]: they know that those bugs are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a clone, you're probably going
to get some sort of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody also likes to say, my buddy
wouldn't give me clones with pests on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't even know they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't check.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not paying enough attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just trying to make $5 a clone by
selling them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't care if you get spider mites or
not because you're going to need more
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside to clones is they come
with free bugs quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get spider mites, you get free root
aphids, you get free white flies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get free fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really lucky, sometimes you
even get free powdery mildew with your new
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disadvantage to growing from clone
is everybody already has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just growing this strain for
yourself, for your medical needs or for a
[SPEAKER_00]: loved one's medical needs and that strain
works perfectly for you, that is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were growing for a market
reason and everybody has that strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to be a better grower
than everybody else growing it to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your product stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're just another guy selling
weed on the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a standout strain,
you will blend in just like everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing the same clone that
all of your competition is growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've really got to be the best grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the downsides to growing
from clone is everybody's got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, that's why some growers are
tight with their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some guys won't let clones out
because they're the only one growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that, you've got to go to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always got some income because
their product stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another downside to working with
clones is they can get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something in me says that you get what
you pay for when it comes to clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to Craigslist and paying
$3 to $5 for a clone, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a $3 to $5 clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be what you're looking for,
but how healthy is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How good of a start did it get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many bugs does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones can get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones that I saw at the dispensary
recently were in four by four cubes of
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones were about six or eight inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were $40.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to buy six of those,
that's going to add up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you throw down $240 every time you
want to start a fresh grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: A package of seeds is way cheaper than
that, but you have to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find the males and you have to
find the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage with clone is somebody has
already done all of that work for you so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can charge you 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the disadvantages to growing
from clone is that they are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're getting them from a friend,
they can add up in cost quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've seen clones go from
anywhere from five or 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw those clones at the dispensary the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a purple punch and a dosey dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were $40 each.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon for me to see a clone
sell for the $500 to $1,000 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are stories of certain cuts
being sold for 10 to $25,000, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what strain we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rumors of astronomical numbers,
but I don't know how much of that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the people in the Bay have
paid ridiculous prices for some of the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush's and some of the more well-known
strains that the rappers rap about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the OG Kush and cookie crosses
went for big money when they first hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have built entire empires and
businesses off of those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clones can get quite expensive quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disadvantage to clones is are they
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody in your area have clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody you trust have clones
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do get clones, are they
accurately labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your friends what clones they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask for a specific strain because if
you ask for wedding cake, now your friend
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly has wedding cake and he needs big
money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask what strains he's got
available, he'll give you a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them the option to invent a
name or slap a label on something just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're willing to throw some money
their direction for that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick debate on seed versus
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over it really quickly again and
recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros of growing from seed,
no bugs, no pests, no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't start off with somebody else's
problems in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage is that you can select
perfectly selected phenotypes that work
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, nobody else is going to have your
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will give you better market value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the cons of growing from seed is
that it takes time for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow them and find out what
you've got and select a keeper and then
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also need to call males and
undesirable phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also a little bit expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also is the strain you want available in
seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the older stuff may not be
available anymore because breeders are
[SPEAKER_00]: always evolving and creating new stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you have to think about is,
are the seeds accurately labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you being sold what you're paying for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about clones really quickly
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros, you have got proven potent
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to plan for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the downsides to working with
clones are you get those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get those pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get free problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, everybody else in the area has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else is already growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing exciting about it unless
it's custom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's custom for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, are clones available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you even get clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you trust the people you have to deal
with to get them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they accurately labeled when you
do get them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my quick, friendly, unbiased
debate on seeds versus clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, being a breeder, I want you to
buy seeds and I want you to buy them at
[SPEAKER_00]: dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want you to do a phenohunt and find
the one that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about phenohunting in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also talk about cutting our own
clones in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, once you've acquired clones or
seeds, you can do a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can select the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can cut clones off of that keeper
and we can be self-sustainable and not
[SPEAKER_00]: have to acquire genetic material from
other sources unless we decide to add
[SPEAKER_00]: something new to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a long episode about what to
expect from a seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would make great supplemental
listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in hearing my
episode about seed pack expectations,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is episode 245.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not available on iTunes and
Stitcher, it is still available on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the episodes are always going to be
archived on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for the Grow From Your Heart

[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in just a couple of days with
another fresh episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Jim Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 362 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these shows off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Orange
Skittles Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this as my morning smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording earlier in the morning than
I usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Orange Skittles has that orange
juice, orange candy sort of a taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got my head going pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great way to start the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking the Orange Skittles Fambrosia
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference between the Ambrosia
and the Fambrosia is the Ambrosia is a one
[SPEAKER_00]: gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they put it in the four gram jar,
that's when they call it the Fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Orange Skittles Fambrosia,
the potency says 73.7% THC, zero CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids, 84.6%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to start the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an uplifting head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that amazing orange candy flavor
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got me nice and talkative and
energized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last lesson, I talked about clones
versus seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this episode, we're going to talk
about regular seeds, feminine seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the seed talk,
I want to give a few shout outs to a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of our Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Angel
Burtis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to Miles Porter,
a super shout out to Jade, and an extra
[SPEAKER_00]: Viking shout out to Grimble the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for all of the support on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already a patron and you
would like to learn how to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: patron, you can do so by going to patreon
.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's P-A-T-R-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn how to sign up, you can
become a patron, and I will give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be about regular
seed, feminized seed, and auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, and deciding what will be best for
you and your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there will have an
opinion about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there will have an
opinion about auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody stop you from growing
what makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why regular seeds exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why feminized seeds
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why auto flower seeds
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are applications for all of those
types of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you love and don't let anybody out
there stop you from growing from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are shopping for seeds,
we are thrown a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is just fluff for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in that information,
we should be able to tell if the seeds we
[SPEAKER_00]: are shopping for are regular, feminized,
or auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be clearly noted somewhere in
the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't see any sort of notation,
I generally assume they are regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a really good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by regular seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: By regular seed, I mean they were produced
conventionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were made with a male plant and a
female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that package of seeds, you will find
males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also not auto flower,
which means they are photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period means that a plant is
triggered into its flowering stage by a
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, this light cycle is mostly
dictated by your location in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you right on the equator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you far north or are you far south of
the equator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as the seasons change, as fall rolls
around, regions on the equator will start
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing longer nights and shorter
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those longer nights and shorter days tell
our plant, hey, winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to start producing your flowers
so that you can reproduce before the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that triggers the plant to go into
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is its photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, most cannabis plants require
about a 12 hour dark period to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors can be different because the sun
puts off different spectrums that trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun sets, it puts off a red
spectrum that tells that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, it's nighttime, and then it starts
going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun rises, it puts off a blue
spectrum that tells the plant it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need the 12-12 outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work closer to a 14 hour day and
more of a 10 hour night outdoors because
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun tells the plants to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants work off the light cycle and
the light cycle works with nature
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, we're controlling that with a
timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your seeds are marked regular seeds or
if it says photo on the package,
[SPEAKER_00]: that indicates that those plants will be
triggered to flower by reducing your light
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule to 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, regular seeds also indicates that
there will be males and females in that
[SPEAKER_00]: package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow a seedless crop,
you will have to pay attention and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the males out of the flowering room
somewhere between seven and ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will start showing their sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to go through and pull out all
of the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave one male plant in there for
too long, it will pollinate and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants around it will be seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how long you let that
male go and how much pollen he released
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much wind flow and how much
movement you have in that grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may seed the entire crop with just one
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were bred conventionally,
traditionally with a male and a female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are photosensitive, which means they
will trigger into flower by reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to approximately 12 hours on and 12
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will work one hour either
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go 13 hours on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go 13 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we recommend 12-12 as the critical
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you will find males and females in
your regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not looking to do any breeding,
if you want to grow seedless cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do need to call those males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only major downfall of
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a package of regular seeds,
you've got about a 50-50 chance of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to dictate what you get with
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people don't want to waste
the energy, the time, the space or the
[SPEAKER_00]: money buying and growing seeds that could
possibly be males and need to be removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is where feminized seeds come
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have hatred toward
feminized seeds because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have hatred or a bias
against feminized seeds because there were
[SPEAKER_00]: a few breeders back in the day that put
out a batch of feminized seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few people bought those and it put a
bad taste in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people spread that taste
throughout the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand when you get a terrible
product, you want to tell people,
[SPEAKER_00]: people believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have come a long way since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand how to produce feminized
seeds on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of breeders and
producers out there putting out reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: quality feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are made properly, feminized
seeds will produce plants that give you
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.9% females.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nature and science together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find things that don't fall into
the chart that we drew because that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: nature works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we say 99.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do my job correctly when I produce
feminized seeds, you will get 99.9% female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a brief explanation on how I
make feminized seeds and how a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leading feminized seed producers make
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I create a solution of silver thiosulfate
that is really easy to learn how to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the instructions for that are
readily available on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a silver thiosulfate solution
from products that are easily attainable
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet for less than $30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use product number one and product
number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix them into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I mix the two things of water
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got my silver thiosulfate
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dilute that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant that I'm using requires a
different dilution and application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a standard that I start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic dilution that I recommend to
start with would be a one to nine ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got nine parts water,
one part of the silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate mixed into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake that up real well and apply that to
the plant on the first day of flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: then apply it every three days for 21
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to give the plant seven
full applications and spray it until it
[SPEAKER_00]: drips and get the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just get the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and spray the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when you're using the silver
thiosulfate spray because it may turn some
[SPEAKER_00]: things purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a white wall, depending on
what you're up against, whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: hits, it could turn it purple,
including your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear a mask when working with the silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take these silver thiosulfate
solution that I have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I mix it at a dilution of nine to
one, nine parts distilled water,
[SPEAKER_00]: one part silver thiosulfate concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I apply it to the plants every three
days for 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets 21 applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then usually around day 25 to 30,
it starts putting out pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I start collecting the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put something, usually a piece of glass,
just depends on where I am and what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a piece of glass near the plant,
collect some pollen as it naturally falls
[SPEAKER_00]: out, pick the male flowers out of there,
gather that, let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it really starts getting
dumping, that's when I'll move it right
[SPEAKER_00]: over by the girls and give it a good
shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've just made feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got six or seven weeks of
nourishing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have done everything carefully
and done everything correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have created feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there should be no reason why those
should be problematic unless I completely
[SPEAKER_00]: screw up the next six or seven weeks,
which is very unlikely because all I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to do is make sure the equipment
functions, make sure everything stays on a
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to feed it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to feed plants that are
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to produce quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to defoliate properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also got to make sure to keep
everything pest and problem free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm quite experienced at all of that
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there should be no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also make sure to thoroughly test run
every batch of seeds I make before they
[SPEAKER_00]: make it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow some out myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give a bunch out to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys see on Instagram,
people have the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, how did they get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they grew something of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to them and I said,
hey, do you want to run my next batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to take good notes,
take good photos, send it all back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll know if I want to release
that line or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have other people grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We test it before it's put out to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know that you're receiving a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go off way on a side rant
here that's not even written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make a new strain, so let's just
say I just pulled some seeds out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a brand new cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before those seeds go anywhere,
I'm going to throw a handful of them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel and germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 24 hours, I'm going to pop it
open and I'm going to see how many have
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted tails and I'm going to make a
note and I'm going to write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, out of a hundred, they sprouted
tails or they did not sprout tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll close it back up and I'll let
the other ones keep going and I'll see in
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 hours how many made tails and I'll take
good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put some of those, the ones that
did sprout tails and look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put those into some cups of
dirt and I'm going to grow them and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pay attention to them and I'm
going to keep a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dry them, cure them,
smoke them, make concentrates out of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at least 120 days from even knowing
what that product tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably closer to 150 with the dry and
cure phase in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is my first grow with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I approve, then I'll pass some seeds
onto Grimm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Grimble grows it and it looks good in
his garden, I'll spread it out to a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they grow it well, that's when I'll let
it go to a vendor or for retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I test the shit out of my feminized
seeds and my regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand behind my product and honestly,
every feminized seed that I produce sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep feminized seeds in stock and
I don't get any complaints on my feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how fems are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I make my fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to feminized seeds is there
are no males to remove from the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that every seed you plant will
result in a harvested crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to grow it long enough to
sex it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be wasting any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's advantageous for people who live in
medical states or anybody who is limited
[SPEAKER_00]: by a plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your feminized seeds are all going to
be females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you would say, why would people grow
photoperiod seeds when they can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds and guarantee that
everything they grow makes it to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, a lot of people have a bias
against feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people like myself like
finding the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding with females and reversed females
and alpha females is a great practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like working with a solid male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a passion for conventional
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make feminized seeds, but I have more
fun with conventional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you may notice when you're
shopping for seeds is that feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are about twice the price of regular
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you do get viable females that you
can take to harvest, but that pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds cost exactly twice as what a regular
pack of seeds cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you didn't have to waste the
time, the space, the soil, the energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you didn't have to have that extra
plant count to add to your numbers in your
[SPEAKER_00]: legal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the packaging says feminized seeds,
that means that 99.9% of the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of that seed package will be
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something that is kind of a
side rant that I was talking to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media about that I want to
include in a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to give it a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the flip when we flip to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized and regular photoperiod seeds,
we flip them to flower by changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle either from 24 on and zero off
to 18 on and six off or however you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your light cycle set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you switch to 12 on and 12 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're going to follow the DJ short
plan, you go 11 on 13 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we flip to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your seed package will give you an
estimate of how long they need to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine to 10 weeks, 60 to 70 days,
whatever it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you initiated that flip is day
one, not the day you see buds set,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the day you smell something,
not the day the butterflies flew in and
[SPEAKER_00]: did their magic dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you change that timer is day one
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you keep track of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're talking about when we
indicated that on the seed package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to add that side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that was even relevant,
but there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bonus nugget for your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work into auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by an auto flowering seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I was talking about your location
in relation to the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us live in an area where we see
seasonal changes and we also see changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in day and nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, there are parts of
Russia and Alaska that will receive
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme stretches of daylight and
nighttime without interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some points in Alaska when they
will have full sunlight for 80 days in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not get a night for 80 solid
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is an extraordinary plant and it
has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis that we're familiar with,
which has evolved from these extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions with no dark, is known as
ruteralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ruteralis plants have evolved to
flower without any dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: After so many generations, they went,
hey, it doesn't get dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do something about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through evolution, they started to
flower without a dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those ruteralis plants have no
desirable effect when smoked, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of desirable traits when grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them stay short, they stay squat,
they push out really nicely and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to change the light cycle to convince
them to flower for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis breeders got a hold of
ruteralis plants and they bred them
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bred our auto flowering ruteralis to
our high potency cannabis plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring resulted in high potency auto
flowering cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the auto flowering seeds available
for most breeders now are feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get auto flowering seeds that
are all girls, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous and we'll talk about that in
just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should warn you that when you're looking
at seeds and you see feminized seeds on
[SPEAKER_00]: there, also look to see if they say photo
period or auto flower on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they indicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't, they are probably photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the auto flower guys like to let
you know that you're working with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They clearly indicate that on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that feminized seeds
cost twice as much as regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers generally cost twice as much
as feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your regular, then they're even
doubled again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will let you know if they're auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you read the package when
you're buying your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll either say regular or feminized or
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do a little research before you buy
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about how
these auto flower seeds are useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to the show for a
while, you love my favorite example of
[SPEAKER_00]: these auto flowers in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several years ago, there was a very large
grow discovered in a national forest not
[SPEAKER_00]: too far from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was discovered that that grow was
ran by a cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the reports and pictures came out,
they were saying that the cartel had three
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of growth happening in
their illegal grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that really made me wonder,
how are they growing different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the sun dictates what our plants
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they put them outside, they all went
into flower at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my brain went, dude, they're using
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this large cartel would set a patch of
auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they would wait a few weeks and they
would set another large patch of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower plants, wait a few weeks and set
another large patch of auto flower plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to where eventually they had a perpetual
cycle going to where they had people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in this national forest,
camouflaged, hidden, growing a perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, packaging up and sending it to who
knows where I have no idea where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were producing quite a bit of
cannabis out there by using auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a perpetual grow under the
natural sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have to veg and then flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could just throw the seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would grow and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way where auto flower seeds
were highly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's scale that down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you've only got one grow space
and you want to produce a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go buy clones from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a friend veg for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you could run a small,
self-sustainable perpetual grow is with
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower plants in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill up a quarter or half of the room with
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they start flowering,
plant more auto flowers and put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have veg plants and flowering
plants in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that with photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're limited on space,
if you've only got one room, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really useful method and a really useful
application for auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major downside that I see to auto
flowering plants is you always have to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot clone an auto flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing with regular or
feminized photo period seeds, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: always able to cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep that clone as a mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can always clone off of that
mother and you can keep that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: With auto flowers, you're always going to
be buying new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And earlier I mentioned most of the auto
flower companies are only putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not even able to breed your own
auto flowers with males and females
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to reverse one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no experience doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my breakdown
on regular seeds, feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regular seeds are always photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them because we find males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like breeding with the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminized seeds can be photo period or
they can be auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably well marked on the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always going to be females if
they were bred properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a whole other podcast episode
about marking feminized seeds with S or R1
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to listen to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is episode 331.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's titled Selfing and Reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn a lot about why we label the
packages the way we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend you listen to an episode
called Seed Pack Expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is number 245.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of useful information in
that episode for anyone who is considering
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowering plants are unique to photo
period plants because they flower based on
[SPEAKER_00]: their size or their age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put them under the veg lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have them in the 18-6 room and they
will still flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will still produce buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of auto flowering plants boast that
they will be completely done around 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 70 days of a full cycle with a
photo period plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got closer to 120 days if you want
usable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my lesson on regular feminized
and auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made your decision easier when it
comes time to go shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to try regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to try feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be afraid to try auto flower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just may fall in love with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you never thought you would
even like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget, you can find your seeds
at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on a Black Friday sale,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should get interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've only been going for about
22 minutes, but honestly my recording gear
[SPEAKER_00]: has been giving me a couple of technical
issues and my throat is obviously burning
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap this up while I've
still got a quality podcast on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose any of the stuff I
recorded.

quit getting glitches in the recording
[SPEAKER_00]: gear and I don't have to wrap up the end
so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 363 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the Hela
Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hela Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the episodes off by
letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished the last dab of the orange
skittles ambrosia that left a nice orange
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor in my mouth, gave me a nice head
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I followed that up with the last dab of
the bubble jack full spectrum extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuego Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combo made me super rambly and gave me
a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I'm doing a long series of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been following along,
I suggest you go back to episode 351 and
[SPEAKER_00]: start there and get caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a solid foundation on
planning your grow and getting prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know that we've selected our space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've selected our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of talk about genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this episode is going to be about
sprouting our new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds can be expensive depending on who
you ordered them from, how many you
[SPEAKER_00]: bought, what kind you purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have spent a lot of money on
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you think about germinating your
new seeds, I highly recommend you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg area ready to rock before you
even think about starting your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think, oh, I can just
germinate these seeds and then I'll build
[SPEAKER_00]: up this veg room in the next couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then while they veg, I'll work on the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get plants going, you start time
traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things go so much more quickly than you
anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things pop up, things get in your way,
then you fall behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds you just paid a bunch of
money for start growing funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get out of control and you've got
shitty plants to start with and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you germinate your seeds,
have your veg space prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my very first piece of advice to
you that will save you a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my second piece of advice is to start
with quality seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get your seeds from a reputable
vendor and also from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for hype when you're shopping
for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find somebody with a good
reputation, somebody that you have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of, and also try to buy those seeds from a
vendor with a good reputation,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that you have heard of,
somebody that has a good relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to buy seeds online,
I recommend you buy from a seed vendor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have to risk customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I recommend the Hella Dank Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend the Seed Bazaar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can also vouch for Southern Oregon
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three quality seed vendors that
I trust and respect and I work with them
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know they will take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not bashing any other seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying I rely on these three
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they are rock solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend you start with a quality
seed, something you know what the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: of that seed were, something you know
where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have access to fancy labeled
expensive seeds, grow what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an ideal world, we would all go to the
store and we look at the shelf and we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: say, you've got that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that that's everybody's fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we are not there yet for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to have to be
resourceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have bought a bag of weed 10 years
ago at some random place and it had seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have to grow those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you're going to get
out of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find the next magical strain in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where your seeds come from,
whether they're regular, whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: feminine seeds, pay close attention to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to keep an eye out when
you're growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got a bag of seeds lying
around and you don't know what any of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are, it's just perhaps a sandwich bag or a
little mason jar just stuffed with random
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from bags of cannabis you've gone
through over time and you can't decide
[SPEAKER_00]: what to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go for the really healthy looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by healthy, I mean probably darker,
probably bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like the tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seeds will not make tiger stripes no
matter how long they grow, no matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: mature, no matter how healthy and strong
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just won't stripe up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a genetic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the darker colored seeds,
the harder seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them a little press on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they don't crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't crack, that's probably a
good seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it cracks, it obviously isn't going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dead seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like a larger cannabis
seed, but I've noticed that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains produce little tiny seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes a little tiny cannabis seed
can produce a seriously potent plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't judge it too much by the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judge it more by the health of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the grayer, light colored seeds
will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put those in my packs because
people freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow those myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those lighter gray, the paler colored
seeds, those will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white seeds, those are more
questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the white seeds do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray kind of silver sheeny seeds,
those usually have a good takeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker ones, those take off quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course you get those bigger,
harder tiger stripe seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those really have a lot of vigor and they
take off really quickly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed health is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big bag of seeds,
try to select the healthiest looking beans
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a couple of them just call you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a bag of a thousand seeds
and two of them just go, hey bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the seeds you want to grow right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is usually accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got our veg space ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to look for in quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some seeds on hand and it is
time to germinate our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by germinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a fancy word for starting the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to give them the proper conditions
to make them start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to crack the seed open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to happen naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the seed to crack itself open and
we want a little tiny taproot to come
[SPEAKER_00]: fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the start of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, those seeds would fall out of
last year's bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter would come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would knock those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds would dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind and the moisture would knock
those seeds out of those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds would fall into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter would come and everything would be
frozen for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the spring came and the winter frost or
the winter moisture started moistening
[SPEAKER_00]: down into the soil, those seeds would
begin to receive moisture and warmth from
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would trigger them to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they would sprout up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would find their way up, dig up out
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd start seeing sun and they'd go,
here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would live and they would
become little baby cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with human involvement, what we've
done, we have collected the seeds before
[SPEAKER_00]: they fall out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I breed, I let the plants get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the seeds get finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut the plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I basically crumble up the buds and I
manually remove the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several methods of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not important right now,
but that process happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds were passed on to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to play the role.
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of mother nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to give these seeds the proper
environment to trigger them to start their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two main things that are going to
start our seeds are water and warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing being water, warmth,
very secondary to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warmth will speed up the process and make
them much happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are countless ways to start new
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover four or five methods
here in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to start with the method I
use personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the old school paper towel
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a plate out of the cupboard,
just a glass plate like you'd serve a meal
[SPEAKER_00]: on or make a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also get a paper towel just like you'd
use to clean up that meal or that
[SPEAKER_00]: sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fold the paper towel one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I fold it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've just got a little rectangular
paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set that paper towel onto the glass
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer bottled water for this because I
don't want the chlorine or whatever else
[SPEAKER_00]: is in my tap water affecting my new
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the folded paper towel sitting
on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply soak that paper towel with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will only hold so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply saturate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I tip the plate to the side to make
sure all that excess water runs out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel and off of that plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drain it right off into the sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a soggy paper towel in
the middle of a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I place my seeds in the paper towel and
then I gently fold it one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to fold it another time you
can and make a little tiny square that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fine but I think that first fold will be
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fold it up to where those seeds are
in the middle and they're getting wet and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not getting any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that that wet paper towel works it
will kind of seal itself up so the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: won't move around too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be any light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some seeds folded up in a
wet paper towel and those are sitting on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point you've got a couple of
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are able to pay attention to those
seeds and be around them all the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they don't get dry you can just
leave them on that plate and leave them
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not too hot or not too cold in
your area they will sprout just fine just
[SPEAKER_00]: left sitting like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to slow down the amount of
moisture leaving that paper towel and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it moist a little bit longer
without having to pay so much attention
[SPEAKER_00]: just set another plate over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip the plate upside down and set it on
top of the first plate just like you do if
[SPEAKER_00]: you had a sandwich in there and you didn't
want anything to get to the sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got two plates with your
little folded up paper towel in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep it moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let it get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're going to get
forgetful or if you need to go to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: an extended period of time and you cannot
monitor the moisture of your new seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: you can always set them in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your folded paper towel with the
moisture in it in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give the moisture nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be trapped inside that little
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you check on them as soon
as you get home from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave that wet paper towel folded
up in a baggie in a really warm spot for
[SPEAKER_00]: too long you can create a mildew
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you pop that open get some
fresh air in there and check on that as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you get home from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds really easy because it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are folding a paper towel into a
square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're moistening it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're letting the excess moisture run
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set the seeds onto that moist paper
towel and then we fold it to cover them
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you need to place another
plate over it to slow down the dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really forgetful and you're
going to be away for a while put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: baggie to retain that moisture then set it
somewhere semi warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time if you are comfortable in
that area your seedlings are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room temperature is acceptable for
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great spot for seedlings if you do not
forget them is on top of the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That temperature that happens right on top
of the refrigerator is perfect for
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't forget them put them in a
baggie set them right on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be ready in 12 to 24 maybe 36
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one of those old big TVs
nobody's got those big old TVs anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to get warm on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great spot to set seedlings and
a baggie was on the back of the old Sony
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinitron 36 inch TV where it got warm
from playing video games all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the perfect temp for
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than those subtle heat sources like
the top of the fridge or the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: TV I really don't recommend a heat mat for
germinating new seeds or for your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen more clones and seeds destroyed
roasted and barbecued than I have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen assisted by one of those heat mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to talk about that more
later in the episode I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's skip that for now and try to stay
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right so we've got our seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are folded up in a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're keeping them moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them dripping all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep them moist and
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got them folded in the paper
towel and you are checking on them every
[SPEAKER_00]: few hours if you were able.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to check on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set your hand right on that paper
towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't crush the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set your hand on the there gently and
if the paper towel is kind of cold kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: chilly they're probably wet enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't feel like it's wet enough
moisten it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your water bottle and just pour the
water on there gently and then tip the
[SPEAKER_00]: plate over toward the excess water runs
off into the sink and then you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: moistened up for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should only be in this paper towel
for 12 to 24 maybe 36 or 48 hours before
[SPEAKER_00]: you see them starting to pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pop open on one side and a little
white tail will start coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what we are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the start of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the beginning of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little root is going to dig down into
the pot once we pot it and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: dig down and start finding nutrients and
that's going to be the legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the foundation and then
it's going to start shooting that seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: straight upward toward the light and then
it's going to shoot little leaves out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there and that little seedling will fall
off and then you've got a little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the start of everything
happening right there and you get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: it because you've just got it right there
in that paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not buried under anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on them about 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see anything, check on them
in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see anything, go 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get impatient after 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be checking on them every four to
six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only need maybe an eighth of an inch,
maybe a quarter of an inch of that taproot
[SPEAKER_00]: to pop out before our seedlings are ready
to put into soil, but we will get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered how to germinate
seeds in a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fold it, you wet it, you drain it,
put the seeds in there, fold it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you keep an eye on it and keep it
moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it slightly warm, but don't roast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you might forget about your
seedlings, place the paper towel set up in
[SPEAKER_00]: a baggie and that will keep them moist
until you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, don't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you unfold that paper towel and
you've got little tap roots sticking out,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when it's time to get ready to put
them into your potting mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to talk about that a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing left to cover in this
section is what if those seeds don't pop
[SPEAKER_00]: open after 48 hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you can really do is wait a
little bit longer, maybe increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't already set them on the
fridge, maybe set them up there on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the refrigerator where it's a little
warmer, maybe lessen the moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got them a little too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just keep that paper towel just
damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've still got a little bit of a
chance, but if they haven't opened after
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 or 72 hours, I would consider starting
a fresh batch of seeds at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it is really cold in your
environment, it will take longer for your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect that if you're growing in the
basement in Colorado, you've got them
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting right on a concrete floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, the warmth will speed
things up, but that too can go wrong in
[SPEAKER_00]: excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to stay in the right area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be about 70 to 85 degrees ish and
you should be okay with rapid growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about our next method for
sprouting our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next method is using a rapid rooters
or root riots or whatever type of plugs
[SPEAKER_00]: are available in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All though I am not including rockwool
cubes in this section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like rockwool cubes for sprouting
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not work well for sprouting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's what you've got, do it similarly
to what I recommend here with the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before you use your rockwool cubes,
make sure you clean them out and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you soak them in a pH balanced solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse them very well to get anything out
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then soak them either in clean water or a
light nutrient solution that has been pHed
[SPEAKER_00]: around six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to use rockwool cubes
without rinsing them and adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all about rapid rooters or root
riot plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start with these plugs,
we need to soak them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a container based on the amount
of plugs I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm generally using a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're sold in a 50 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time I just do all 50 and I
either do 50 clones or 50 seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use the whole package.
[SPEAKER_00]: You soak as many as you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I get a container that will
fit enough water to soak as many plugs as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I adjust the pH to somewhere between six
and six, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually place the rapid rooter plugs
back into the rapid rooter tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using the tray, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need it, but that's usually what
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it right in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take a seed and I insert the seed
into the rapid rooter plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed goes pointy and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at your seeds, it's got a
round end and it's got a pointy end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be obvious when you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pointy end goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because of the way that
the seed grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pointy end down when you're putting it
into a rapid rooter or any sort of a cube,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're going directly into soil,
pointy end down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are going into a rapid
rooter, if you're going into a root riot
[SPEAKER_00]: cube, if you're going into soil,
or if you're going against my advice and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going directly into rockwool,
it is always suggested that you plant your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds about one knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go just the tip of your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push it in until you press that first
knuckle, that first bend in your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's far enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seedling is deep enough into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deep enough into that cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to be buried way down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands a much better chance if it's
just about knuckle deep is all you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've got all my seedlings planted
and I've got all my cubes labeled,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you label each cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're planting different strains,
make sure you've got a way to label each
[SPEAKER_00]: cube so you know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also label, if you're doing more than one
paper towel of seeds, make sure you label
[SPEAKER_00]: that paper towel some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you are just doing one pack of
seeds or one strain, but if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple, please carefully label things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in our rapid rooter cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are carefully labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are nice and moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are about knuckle deep down into the
cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I place them under a very light light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need very powerful lighting for
sprouting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really weak LED or a T5 kind of high up
is plenty of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A compact fluorescent is probably just
enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to go extreme for a
seedling, just enough to encourage it to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets bigger, we do need light,
but right now we don't need ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting for a small seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So place it under a light that will give
it warmth and that will encourage it to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in about two or three days,
maybe four or five days at the latest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should see a little sprout pop out of
your cube and you have now got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that seedling can live in that little
rapid rooter for several days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to need it forever home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need to go into either some
soil or a hydro setup fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's in that rapid rooter,
we need to keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep it somewhere between 70
and 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to keep that root cube moist
at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it dries up, that plant has no life
source and it will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it moist and keep it warm and keep
it under a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to think about getting it
into a good potting mix or into a hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: system very soon so that it can thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the basics of sprouting a seed
in a rapid rooter or a root riot cube,
[SPEAKER_00]: or against my advice, if you choose to use
a Rockwell cube, you would use a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, soak it with the proper pH
solution, then press the seedling in,
[SPEAKER_00]: pointy in down and only go about a knuckle
deep, set it under a light and leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: alone for two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see a little sprout pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see the sprout pop up,
look in the little hole and see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the seedling simply gets caught
and it's bent over and it can't pop itself
[SPEAKER_00]: up out of the root cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can carefully get a pair of tweezers
or a chopstick and very gently encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant to grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull it out of the seed casing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull it out of the cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe spread the whole of the cube open
just a little bit and encourage it to pop
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just needs to bend up and come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably guide it out if you're
gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's close to doing it on its own,
don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it struggle and it will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like it's been long enough and
you're getting impatient, just give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may pop out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you're risking killing this
seedling if you get too rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to destroy it if you get too
rough, but you've got a good chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use your thumbs and spread that rapid
rooter open just a little tiny bit and you
[SPEAKER_00]: may open it just enough for that seed to
unbind itself and be able to pop straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just be stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to move up and the two leaves
on the top, they just got stuck somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens quite a bit and it'll just
have to break itself free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that if it doesn't pop
up in four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the others have popped up and you've
got one that didn't pop up, look in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be the issue with that one
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's kind of touch on another method
that is very similar to the rapid rooters
[SPEAKER_00]: and the root riot cubes, but it is also
very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next method, you cannot put this into
a hydro kit as simply as you could a rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooter or as simply as you could a seed
from a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people do it, but it's not
as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more challenging and it's not as
logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about using Jiffy cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jiffy cubes are great if you're going to
go into soil, but like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really use them going into a
hydro system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's somebody doing it going
to tell me I'm wrong, but it's not common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a Jiffy cube, they're very similar to
the rapid rooters, but they start off
[SPEAKER_00]: really small and you moisten them and they
expand to the proper size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you moisten them they puff up,
you squeeze the excess water out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there they work just like the
rapid rooters or the root riot cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You place your seedling in there,
pointy in down, you go about knuckle deep,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you've got to keep your Jiffy
cube moist just like you do with your
[SPEAKER_00]: other cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're using rapid rooters or root
riots or Jiffy cubes, or if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: against my advice still and using the
rockwool cubes, make sure not to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: too moist for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are too moist, they will simply
rot your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will turn green, they will turn
brown, they will fall over and die,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they will not even germinate at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big difference between being
soaked and being wet and being moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to soak them in the beginning,
put the seeds in there when they are
[SPEAKER_00]: soaked, then just keep it wet from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can usually tell by looking at the
rapid rooters how dry or wet they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start getting that brown crusty
color, they're too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start getting that sheen to
them, they start showing a little silver,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little light reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're really, really black,
that's when they are soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn how to identify soaked and
saturated and wet and moist and create a
[SPEAKER_00]: little scale for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the one through five watering
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need a similar thing for the
rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're totally soaked and black,
that's a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're dry and crispy, that's a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep them about a three at all
times, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go, one through five tech on
rapid rooters, just like we did on
[SPEAKER_00]: watering normal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know how to germinate seeds in
paper towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to germinate seeds in rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of know how to do it in rock wool
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to germinate seeds in Jiffy
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just like doing it in the rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you moisten them, they expand,
you squeeze the excess water out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you treat it just like a rapid rooter
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next option is to plant our seedlings
directly into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't we do that in our personal
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about planting
our seeds directly into soil or the medium
[SPEAKER_00]: we are going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan to start your seedling in
soil, I highly recommend you use a very
[SPEAKER_00]: small container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a beer cup or something
that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to have a tiny,
tiny plant in a large container of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first recommendation is a small
container with plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second recommendation will be a good
soil for starter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something with a lot of aeration and
something with not too much nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something with some mycos or maybe
some beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, but we don't need a lot of
boosts for our little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start with a small container of high
quality starter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my container and I've got my
starter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I moisten that soil before I put my
seedlings into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply water that soil with a pH
adjusted solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water pH around six to six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water it on in, let it drain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's done draining, take your pointer
finger and just make a little tiny hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just knuckle deep, just like I keep saying
in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may name the episode that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go about one knuckle deep into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take your seedling and just set it
right inside that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then gently press the dirt right over that
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just real gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cover up that ceiling and then just
let it rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then within 24 to 48 to 36, maybe 72
hours, you should see a little baby plant
[SPEAKER_00]: just popping up right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just see two little green leaves
just popping right up out of that top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep my little baby plants in
the beer cups under a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep the light kind of far when
they're little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as they get bigger, I move the light
a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to let the seedlings get too
stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start getting a little leggy,
I move the light closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put a fan on them while they're
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives them a little strength,
makes them a little more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are advantages and disadvantages to
starting them in the beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage, they're already in their
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to up-pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to transplant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do any damage to a
little seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is sometimes you just
completely lose a ceiling in a beer cup
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they just totally disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't sprout at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you totally drown them by trying
to water so much soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting them in beer cups and soil is a
little trickier, but it may be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: option for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody is able to order rapid
rooters or root riot cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has access to a rockwool
cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may just want to try it
because that's the way it happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a rundown of my basic methods of
germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully one of those methods works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I use the folded paper towel
method the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I may use the
rapid rooter method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, but I honestly do not start seeds
directly in soil anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that I can start a lot more in
much less space by using the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the amount of space it takes to
start 100 rapid rooters compared to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large difference in the amount of
space that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have any experience with
the Jiffy cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had to use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had access to the rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I've just been sticking with
the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm doing the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use the method that works the best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you also to try different
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think something works great,
why not try another method?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some seeds that you can
spare, why not try something you may find
[SPEAKER_00]: that something works better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got our seeds germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've either got some seeds folded into a
paper towel or we've got a rapid rooter or
[SPEAKER_00]: a root riot or a rockwool cube with roots
hanging out of the bottom of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next step is to pot our new seedling
into a pot of soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I will cover how to pot
the seeds germinated from a paper towel
[SPEAKER_00]: into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my next episode is going to be about
cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then shortly after that, we will have to
pot the clones into soil, which means I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do a combo episode of planting
our new seedlings in the rapid rooters and
[SPEAKER_00]: planting clones in rapid rooters into
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I'm just going to knock
that out in one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part will be coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, let's talk about planting our
freshly germinated seedlings that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in a wet paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to catch these seeds when the new
tap roots are very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to get it too long and too
out of control because I feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me too much opportunity to cause it
too much stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I see my seedlings crack
open a little bit and that little tap root
[SPEAKER_00]: is sticking out just a little tiny bit,
I'm comfortable putting them into their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do that with a very similar method
as I did earlier when we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: planting seeds into the beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a beer cup or a very small pot with
plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill it with a quality soil that is good
for small plants, something with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration and plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I moisten that soil with water pH
around six to six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do the same thing as we've been
doing the whole episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a little tiny hole about knuckle
deep in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I simply place the germinated seed in
that little hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to point it with that little
white root pointing straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your tap root is nice and short,
don't worry about which direction your
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling is facing when you place it into
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really long, you may want to make
sure you point that root down and the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gently place your seedling in the soil,
brush dirt over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to bury it or pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cover it and then the tap root will
go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start to spread out and the little
tiny plant will grow up to the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll push the seedling with a little set
of tiny, tiny leaves right through the top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and you'll have a little starter baby
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing to worry about when potting
your new seedlings is to not damage that
[SPEAKER_00]: little white tap root sticking out of the
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best not to disrupt, stress or
damage that little white tap root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I've got it potted, I put it under
a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the light a little distance away so
that I don't shock the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant gets bigger, I bring the
light a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I feel like the plant has kind of
taken off, I put a fan on it and then once
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets its first set of serrated leaves,
I start adding very light doses of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how I pot my seedling that was
germinated from a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically fill a beer cup with good
dirt, poke a hole in the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: go knuckle deep in the soil on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop my little germinated seedling in
there and cover it up and then put it
[SPEAKER_00]: under the light and wait for it to pop up
and then it grows and grows until I see a
[SPEAKER_00]: set of leaves with serration and that is
when I start feeding it a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: light nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a couple of things
that happen quite often when we are
[SPEAKER_00]: working with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the seed shell will get stuck to
the seed and hinder the seed's growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: threaten that seed's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not as scary as it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it happens, you'll know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed hole will just get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedling will come up out of the dirt
and you'll see that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are trying to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to live and it's just trying
to open up but it can't because that seed
[SPEAKER_00]: casing is just stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a spray bottle with water and I
moisten that seedling really heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spray it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep spraying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More moisture, more moisture, more
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then see if you can just brush it off with
your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just come right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, spray it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spray more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that still doesn't work, get some
tweezers and just do a gentle dissection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is really moist, you should be able
to get that seed casing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is supposed to come off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the plant opens itself up,
the way that that seed casing spreads in
[SPEAKER_00]: half, it should pop right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a little assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little moisture, little tweezers,
maybe a pair of chopsticks depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how skilled you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be too hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to get in there and pull
that casing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I talked about not using heat
mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have honestly seen people roast more
seeds with heat mats than I have ever seen
[SPEAKER_00]: success with a heat mat from a seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I have ever needed a heat
mat was when I was growing in a warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado and it was really cold during
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times I don't use a heat mat for
cloning or for seedlings and I have great
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are comfortable in the area,
your seedlings are probably comfortable in
[SPEAKER_00]: that area also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not talking about some Colorado
mountain boy who is outside barefoot in
[SPEAKER_00]: the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am talking about a normal person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room temperature is acceptable for your
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got one more thing I want to touch
on before I start wrapping up the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The note I wrote is called pre-soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to pre-soak their
seeds before the official germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got older seeds that have been
sitting around for longer, I may recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you give them a pre-soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply pre-soak them in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you germinate them, I recommend 12
hours, maybe 24 at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never go more than 24 hours on a soak
because that will drown your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory behind the pre-soak is some
seeds just have a hard outer coating and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to germinate very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soaking them in water for 24 hours will
definitely soften that outer coating and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage easier germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have got older seeds that you
have been having a problem getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate, maybe soak them for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then give them the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work, try soaking some for
24 hours, then giving them the paper towel
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work, then we are going to
need to try more scientific approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chemicals we can add.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tricks we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is much more advanced science
than what we are prepared for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have got old seeds or if you
feel like you have got really hard seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with a really thick coating, don't be
afraid to give them a pre-soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never go more than 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like that is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like that is a
good lesson on how to germinate your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not forget to teach you guys how to
pot those freshly sprouted seeds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have got in your rapid rooters or your
rockwool cubes like I told you not to do
[SPEAKER_00]: or in your Jiffy pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that in a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is written down.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 364 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab of Stardog
Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love the flavor of the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the effect of the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the folks at Apothecary always get it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Apothecary Farms and
the Stardog Ambrosia extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, this is going to be
another Grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
I've been doing a long series of Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we're going to talk about
cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut clones into rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will cut clones for use in an easy
cloning machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will also talk briefly about
cutting clones directly into cups of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have a lot of detailed
information written down, so let's not
[SPEAKER_00]: waste a lot of time with the long intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into a Grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a good spot to start talking about
cutting clones is beginning with healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a healthy donor plant to have a
healthy clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you listen to episode 315 and
learn all about healthy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've listened to episode 315 or if
you feel like you are up to speed and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have healthy veg plants or healthy mother
plants, let's get into a lesson on cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about why we take
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I want to cut a clone from a
healthy plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I suggest you cut a clone from
every new plant you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the opportunity to cut a
clone and keep a clone in another veg
[SPEAKER_00]: space, I always recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may grow that pack of seeds and find
the most amazing plant in that pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you did not take a clone,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to cutting clones is if you
do find a keeper in a pack of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow that same keeper over and
over again if you have taken a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have reliable, tested genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know it grows the way you want it
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main point of taking a clone
from any type of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are getting a reproduction of the
plant you are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can either grow out that clone or
you can create a mother plant from that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone and take multiple clones from that
plant and fill your grow room or rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: with that same cultivar over and over
again and have repeatable, reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: results with that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds do show variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to narrow down the variation in
seeds through breeding, but that does take
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from clones,
you know you are going to have exact
[SPEAKER_00]: copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take 100 clones off of one plant
and you put those all in a grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all going to act exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't see any variation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the point and the purpose and
the advantage of growing with clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: why we want to learn how to take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know somebody out there listening is
going to bring up the subject of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you take a listen to episode 343
of the Grow From Your Heart podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: you will hear my full opinion of genetic
drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to cover three
common methods for cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all three of those methods,
one of the most important things we can
[SPEAKER_00]: think about is cleanliness of the plants
and cleanliness of our tools and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness of our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is very important when cutting
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking something sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are cutting that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are severing a limb from our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the tool we used was clean and
sanitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that plant was pest and pathogen
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you were wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have just made a fresh cut in a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a plant with a cut in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a fresh cut with an open wound
at the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of opportunity for infection
or pathogen to enter this plant at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your environment clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everywhere you set that clone needs to
be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product you dip that clone into needs
to be clean and contaminant free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're pouring out your dipping
gel, your clone X gel or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to use, don't dip your clones
directly into the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour out about a shot glass worth at a
time and dip your fresh cuts into there
[SPEAKER_00]: before you stick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommendation to keep some
sanitation going through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every step of cloning, we need to think
about cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out your cloning trays before you
use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your cloner before you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you just bought them, rinse them
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those neoprene collars, give them a nice
rinse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using permaclone collars,
clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is sanitize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came with instructions on how to
clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow those instructions and you can use
those over and over again with no
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean every part of the cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are basically performing major surgery
on our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want to be in that environment
with your arms severed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you trust me in your clone room to
say, I got it, bro, and grab whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors you use to cut the clone,
I'm going to cut your arm off with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to set your arm wherever
you put the clones after you chop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut a bunch of clones and then you set
them down somewhere until you get a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to dip them and stick them because they
can't all go at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you set those clones,
I want to set your severed arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you okay with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to dip your severed arm into
some clone gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to clone your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stop there, but I want your
mind to think about that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, are you comfortable running around
with that severed arm in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it clean enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking around going, I'm going to
get some dirty shit in this stump?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that in your cloning
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a broom, get a mop, clean some shit
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of cutting clones will give
your plants a lot of opportunity to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: up problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we see people pick up
problems that they later try to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: as genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wear gloves, clean your tools,
clean all of your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use fresh neoprens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using permaclone clone
collars, you need to replace them every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to reuse those cheapos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of space in there where
things can build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The permaclone collars are made out of a
different product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to reuse the cheapos,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward from talking about
cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the actual procedure for
cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two methods I use most commonly in a
commercial grow environment or in my own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows are cutting into rapid
rooters or using easy cloners or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare turbo cloner machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about the easy cloner or the
turbo cloner, I will probably say easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both very similar machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about cutting clones first
into rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cost effective and it does not
require an expensive machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting clones in rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one, soak the rapid rooter plugs in a
weak but pH balanced nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using bottled nutrients,
you can use your veg nutrients at about a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter strength for your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill up a gallon container of water,
pour in a quarter strength worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and then adjust the pH between
5.8 and 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I usually get the tray with the whole
setup that's got the little spots for
[SPEAKER_00]: those plugs to go, so I've got a little
spot to keep them stood up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to buy the whole tray,
you don't have to do that many clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find filling the whole tray keeps the
moisture level easier to control inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you soak your plugs, then you put all
of those plugs in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put all 50 of them in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once all 50 of them are in there,
now it is time to go and cut our clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to cut clones from a few different
parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm topping my plants, I quite often
make clones from that super healthy fat
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those make beautiful clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've already cut the top out,
I also make clones from when I lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go clean off the bottoms of the
plants, I usually clean up the bottom six
[SPEAKER_00]: or eight, maybe 10 or 12 inches,
depending on the size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottom branches, those make
beautiful clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take your clone from any part of
the plant as long as it is healthy and as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you are happy with removing that
section of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before I flip my plants into flower,
I do a major cleanup anyway, so that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good opportunity for me to get clones off
the bottom parts of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to cut your clones from the
healthiest part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take about a five to eight inch cut off of
your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you cut it, try to cut at a 45
degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a little bit about
that 45 degree angle here in just a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, always, always clean your scissors,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your scissors with rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you change mother plants,
if you cut 20 clones off of this mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then you decide to cut clones
off of another mother plant, clean your
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, we talked about this being just
like surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't use the same scissors on
different patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spread disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the exact same reason why we want
to clean our scissors between mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I'm cutting clones, I try to
take a small cup with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: water with nutrient solution in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take as many cuttings as I need at
one time and fill that cup and then take
[SPEAKER_00]: that cup back to my cloning station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go cut a clone, then take that
back to the station and then go cut
[SPEAKER_00]: another one and then take it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go get as many as I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need 50, I'll go find 50 good clones
of one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I head back to the clone station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dip them and I stick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can put the dome on and then I can
leave them alone for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to keep walking back and
forth between each cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about the plants
wilting because the dome isn't on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to keep taking the dome off
and on trying to rescue plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more efficient and gentler on
the plants to go take all of our cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: then head back to the clone station and
work on all of them at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've taken all of my cuttings and I'm
back at the clone station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to take each cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about five to eight inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the genetics and the
stretchiness of that plant on a five to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight inch cutting, you may have one or
two little side nodes sticking off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the top, we've got that fresh new
growth coming right out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are those two main leaves
coming right out of the top of that
[SPEAKER_00]: branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically want to remove everything
from our clone other than those two top
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that new part sticking out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less is more when it comes to taking
clones in a rapid router.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a lot of material to get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get more experienced at it,
once you get better, you may be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take larger clones, but smaller clones are
easier in this type of setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we really need is those top two
leaves and that new fresh part coming
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing really there to sustain
life in this clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need to give it a lot of stuff
to try to keep alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to burden this plant by
having a whole bunch of extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And extra little side branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just those top two plus the new stuff
coming out is all we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally cut those two top leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trim them quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf is oval shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off real skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point it starts to taper
back in right where it tapers in is where
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut that leaf tip off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right at the widest part of that leaf,
I just cut it right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a little stock with these
two leaves that have been trimmed up and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just a little fresh part coming right
out of the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot there, but that is much
easier for us to sustain than a big plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in a clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got this little stick with
these trimmed up little leaves with this
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh growth coming out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at the very bottom of that,
when we cut it off, we should have cut at
[SPEAKER_00]: a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't make a nice 45 degree angle
when you originally cut it, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: make the bottom of that stem a nice 45
degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing I do is use a razor
blade to gently scrape the edge of my
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's going to be submerged into
the rapid rooter, I gently, very gently
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a scrape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to take off that very top
layer, just disrupt the very outside layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of that clone so that it will kind of
break that skin and give it an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to root a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give it a very, very light scraping.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the clone that is going to be dipped
into the rapid rooter will get just a very
[SPEAKER_00]: light scraping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see the white part of the plant,
you've gone too deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to kind of disrupt the outer
layer of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just take a razor blade, sometimes I
even use my cloning scissors, and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: rough up that edge just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the outer layer is a little bit
of a different color than the inside
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know you're doing it
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kill your clones by cutting too
deep this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give them a very little scrape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to skip this step until you
learn what you're doing, that is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this may speed you up just a little
bit by breaking that outer layer of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fleshy plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a nice cleaned up plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cut a nice 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of scraped it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove that outer skin, to give it an
opportunity to root, now we need to dip
[SPEAKER_00]: our fresh cutting into a rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing my best to not recommend
any specific brands or products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I have had the best experience
with has been the Purple Clone-X Cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: Gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works great for cutting clones into
rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great for cutting clones into
Rockwell cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works perfectly for cutting clones into
the Easy Clone machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also works well for cutting clones
directly into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you right away that that product
is not organic and many people will have
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions about that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am aware of what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the research and I know what is
in there and I am okay with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to do a little bit of
research when you were selecting your
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm on the subject, always wear
gloves when using any type of cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our Clone-X Gel or whatever
cloning solution you have chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually pour mine out of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to dip my clone directly into
that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a problem with my donor plant,
now I have just dipped that dirty plant
[SPEAKER_00]: right into my cloning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I plan on using this cloning solution
to make all of my clones, which means I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to set myself up for failure from
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pour your cloning solution out of the
bottle into a smaller container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use a shot glass or something
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you choose to use, don't pour the
leftovers back into the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That defeats the whole purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pour out some cloning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then simply dunk the fresh cut end of your
new cutting into that cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stir it around so that it gathers a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then gently place that end right into that
hole in the rapid router.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't press too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it bends or kinks over, you've broken
it and you've killed that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've either got to cut that end off and
start fresh or start with the fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gently push that cutting into that
plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't want it to penetrate all the
way through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it pokes out all the way through the
bottom, that end of it is just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: rot and it's going to turn black and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've buried your cutting too far
under the router, it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grab it and pull it right on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pull it real gently and back it out
just a little bit and it will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you go deep enough into the
root plug for the plant to grab and have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of life in there, but don't go
so far that it pokes all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were planting seeds, I taught you
to only go knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go a little deeper than
that when you're sticking your cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a rapid router or a root
riot, I recommend you go about three
[SPEAKER_00]: quarters of the way into the root plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're an inch deep, go three
quarters of an inch down into that plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you basically repeat that process
until you've got your desired amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones cut, dipped, and stuck into the
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got my tray full, I spray the
inside of the dome, I close the vents of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dome, I put that on the tray,
and then I set it underneath a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put my T5 light about six to ten
inches above my clone dome and I leave
[SPEAKER_00]: those lights on for 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find it is much easier to control
the environment around your clones if they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any changes in light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time the light goes on and the light
goes off, the temperature and the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: will change and you will change the
environment in your clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to keep your clones warm and
moist and humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by keeping the light on all of the
time, we're able to keep a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: environment inside of that dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have got our fresh cuttings
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them dipped into cloning
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them stuck into the rapid
routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sprayed the inside of the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We closed the vents on the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the dome on the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we slid the whole clone set up
underneath the T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here comes the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part is waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need to check on your
clones for three days if you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you see condensation on the
inside of that dome over the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: days, you don't need to do anything to
those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around day four or five, those clones may
need to be re-moistened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop the dome off of the clones and take a
look at the rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to pick one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it right out of the tray and feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it heavy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Visually look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to tell when rapid
routers need moisture by looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are soaked, they are black.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look completely black.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start drying up a little bit,
they get a little bit of a silvery gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are too dry, they become brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep them moist, but not soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give it a little gentle squeeze,
you don't want the water to run down your
[SPEAKER_00]: arms, but you need a little moisture to
stay on your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them moist, but not soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that rapid router to be able to
hold enough water to sustain life,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also don't want to have so much
water in that rapid router that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no room for oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check your rapid router for moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is dry, we need to re-moisten it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend using a spray bottle and
spraying a very light nutrient mix into
[SPEAKER_00]: the rapid routers and just spray it until
they are soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pour off the excess water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any water left in that tray,
simply pour it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need water sitting in the bottom
of that tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: When roots do start to develop,
if they're hanging in that water,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will just rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will defeat the purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give the rapid routers a little bit of
a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them nice and moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got all the plugs nice and
moist, put the dome right back on the tray
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it back under the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on day five, we're going to open the
vents on the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a dome with the two small
vents, you can open them all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that dome with the giant
vent in the middle, I would say maybe go a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter, maybe go halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go all the way right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is too much airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that hole is too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on day five, we open the vents and
start giving those clones a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to need to pay attention
to the moisture level a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently because we are allowing
moisture out of that dome by opening those
[SPEAKER_00]: vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are letting fresh air in, but we are
also letting our moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start paying attention to the clones
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now beginning at day six, we are going to
start hardening off the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is we are simply going to
start removing that dome and introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the environment slowly every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just take off that dome
and expect the plants to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to introduce them to the
environment slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, they are really relying on that
dome to keep the wind down and keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and moisture in that environment
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get them used to being in
population with the rest of the big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do this is to take that dome
off and slowly increase the interval
[SPEAKER_00]: without the dome every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting at day six, we're going to
take the dome off for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take that dome off, let the plant
survive for 15 minutes, check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they're too dry,
moisten them up, put the dome right back
[SPEAKER_00]: on, let the plants hang out for the rest
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second day, we're going to crack that
dome for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop off the dome, see how wet those rapid
rooters are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they're too dry,
moisten them up, let them sit for 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the moisture level again before you
close them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they're too dry,
moisten them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always better to moisten them as you
open them so that you don't soak them and
[SPEAKER_00]: then put the lid on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you take the dome off,
moisten them, let them get their 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes of hardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then check those rapid rooters again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they may need moisture,
go ahead and add some, then put that dome
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to repeat this process again
on day three.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get 15 minutes on day three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on day four, we are going to increase
our interval to 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on day five, we are going to increase
to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to pay attention to the
clones as you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start looking weak or if they're
getting angry while the dome is off,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to put that dome back on there
and rescue your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal here is to harden these
plants off so they can learn to survive
[SPEAKER_00]: without that dome for protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as these clones start getting stronger,
we want to leave the dome off longer and
[SPEAKER_00]: longer as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should see little roots pop out of
these clones around seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our goal is to have these little
babies into soil around 10 or 14 days into
[SPEAKER_00]: this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to slowly start getting them
used to the outside environment by
[SPEAKER_00]: hardening them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increase your open time every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also pay attention to the plants and
don't stress them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe on day six, you go 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe on day seven, you go 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe on day eight, you're going all the
way up to 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe by day 10, you've got them open for
a full hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal here is that when we do
transplant these into their six inch net
[SPEAKER_00]: pots or their starter pots, that they
don't have to rely on that dome,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are okay being open all of the
time because they will no longer have a
[SPEAKER_00]: dome for protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly increase your open time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get your clone domes open for
two solid hours without seeing any
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects on your clones,
they are certainly ready to go into their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or cocoa pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the most common mistake I see when
people are making clones is they over
[SPEAKER_00]: moisten the clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They soak them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to drown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to the amount of
moisture in your clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to drown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new at cutting clones,
I suggest you take way too many clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take way more than what you're going to
need because you're going to kill a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of them in the learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we basically have to sustain these
clones in this dome until they are rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to put into our soil or soilless
mix or go into our hydro setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever we choose to do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told you that I'm going to talk
about potting our seedlings and potting
[SPEAKER_00]: our clones in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to another cloning
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cutting clones directly
into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were going to cut clones directly
into soil, I would do it very similarly as
[SPEAKER_00]: the method I use to cut clones into
Rockwell cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is that I would use a
beer cup filled with good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to recommend brands,
but I'm going to say I would probably use
[SPEAKER_00]: Light Warrior soil for my babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would buy a bag of Light Warrior soil
and I would buy some beer cups and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: poke a bunch of holes in the bottom of the
beer cups for drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pack up the beer cup with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would moisten the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would cut the clone exactly the
same as I do for the rapid router.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would dip it into the rooting solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would make a hole in that soil with
my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this situation, I would go about two
knuckles deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you place that dunked clone into that
hole and gently backfill that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push the soil right around the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you want that plant to be
supported and it looks like you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little baby plant sticking out of a beer
cup filled with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're basically done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to take a clear beer cup
and place it upside down on top of that
[SPEAKER_00]: beer cup to act as a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use a piece of tape, generally a
piece of duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just wrap it right around there to
make sure that that lid stays on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have created a one plant dome
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a beer cup filled with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moistened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a plant in there and you've put
a dome right on top of it to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that underneath the light and it will
act just like the domed clone acts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the rapid router, we're going to
need to check on that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it soaked and we don't want
it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need it moist and warm so that our
clone stays healthy and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantage here is once that clone
roots, we don't have any work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already transplanted into its first
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is that it takes as much
space as a beer cup for each clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't fit 50 clones in a small
space like you could in a rapid router
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the beer cups work if you're only
trying to take a couple clones and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to go buy rapid routers and you
don't want to buy a dome setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can fill up a couple of beer cups with
dirt, moisten up the soil, put a little
[SPEAKER_00]: hole in there with your finger,
clip, dip and stick a few clones and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can create clones just like you would in a
dome setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you harden off your cupped
clones just like you do your domed clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and you should have healthy, happy little
babies in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I've been talking for 25
minutes and my throat is starting to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a funky noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pull a couple of fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, we will continue a
lesson on cloning and we will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting clones in an easy cloner or a
Botanicare turbo cloner machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple of fat dabs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am back and it
is time to talk about cutting clones in an
[SPEAKER_00]: aero cloner and that will include an easy
cloner or a Botanicare turbo cloner or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever type of auto cloner you may have
purchased or maybe even built on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first piece of advice is to replace all
of your clone collars each cycle and start
[SPEAKER_00]: with fresh, clean neoprene clone collars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only brand that I am aware of that I
would approve of reusing are the
[SPEAKER_00]: permaclone clone collars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are made from a different material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are much easier to sanitize and they
are the only brand that I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: recycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the only brand I've had any
positive experience trying to reuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the cheap neoprenes,
it's probably safest and most cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective to throw them away and buy
freshies every run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is most cost effective to buy the
permaclone clone collars and follow their
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions on sanitizing them after each
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just had a lot of great experiences
with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always start with fresh, clean clone
collars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to make sure that the
cloner is completely cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to fill the cloner up with hot
water and bleach and let it run for about
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I dump it out, hose it out real well,
fill it up with clean water and let it run
[SPEAKER_00]: for just a little while to make sure I
rinse all that bleach water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I dump it out and let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's fully dry, I give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't smell any bleach, I'm pretty
sure that it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I fill it up with clean
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest RO water if you've got it,
but that is not an option for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm filling up the easy cloners,
I generally fill them right below the
[SPEAKER_00]: halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spray halo is where you screw the
emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part's called the halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the pump and then the halo and
then the emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill it up right to the base of the
halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got the appropriate amount of
water in the cloner, I apply clone X
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, the purple stuff that comes in
the tall bottle, not the thick stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the cloning solution, not the clone
gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called clone X solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply that to the cloner to get the EC
between 1.0 and 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my EC, the electrical conductivity
to be between 1 and 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I adjust the pH to 5.7 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step is to add clear res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear res is a product that will prevent
algae from building up inside of our
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you put 30 milliliters of
clear res for every five gallons of water
[SPEAKER_00]: in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you filled it up with the five gallon
bucket, you need 30 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you filled it up with 10 gallons,
you need 60 milliliters and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Date it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little sticker and write the date on
that sticker and put that sticker on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sticker with the date is important
because you will need to add clear res
[SPEAKER_00]: again every five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I put a sticker on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if you're working in a facility
with more than one person, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: people doubling up and adding too much
clear res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says employee number 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change the clear res on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when day five comes around,
we know somebody needs to change the clear
[SPEAKER_00]: res.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get 30 milliliters of clear res per
five gallons and pour it right on into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write employee number 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this much clear res in here on this
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we know when to add more and we
don't double up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down how much clear res you put in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how often you do it so that you don't
double up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I suggest you put 30
milliliters per every five gallons every
[SPEAKER_00]: five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've added our clonex solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our EC somewhere between 1 and
1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've adjusted the pH to somewhere between
5.7 and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added the appropriate amount of
clear res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put the lid on the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn on the pumps and make sure all
of the emitters are properly functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to open it up and
peek in there and make sure that all those
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayers are spraying everywhere and that
all of the inside of that cloner is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop out a couple random neoprens and put
your finger in there and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: your finger is getting sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that all of the
sprayers are covering all of the cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: spots inside of that cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you're sure that cloner is set up
and functioning properly and that all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the emitters are spraying and covering the
entire inside of that cloner, it is time
[SPEAKER_00]: to take our cuttings to fill the clone
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to take our cuttings in a
very similar method as we did in the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: router technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut about a 5 to 8 inch
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to trim these leaves as
extremely as we did on the other set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a good idea to cut the tips off
a little bit to encourage some growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean up your cutting, then cut it at a
45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it in the clonex gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go about 1 inch into the clonex
gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those neoprene discs open up like a
Pacman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it up to look like Pacman and then
close it around your clone and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 1 inch of material sticking
out of the bottom of the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you take that neoprene disc and stick
it right back into the machine with that
[SPEAKER_00]: freshly cut part sticking down into the
water and the new plant sticking straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now carefully repeat that process until
you fill the cloner or you run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I like to hang a T5 light above the
clone machine and I generally place it
[SPEAKER_00]: about 8 to 12 inches above the canopy of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to leave the live on for 24
hours for these clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may choose to go 18 on 6 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had amazing results running the
lights on for 24 hours and also leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: the pump inside of the cloner on for 24
hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can experiment with light cycles and
pump cycles as much as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find that 24 hours of light works
best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find that some dark cycle works
best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water in your cloner is getting too
hot, a good way to cool that water down is
[SPEAKER_00]: by letting the pump rest for a few seconds
every minute or a few minutes every hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one situation, I would run the pump for
45 seconds on and 15 seconds off every
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those timers are quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another environment, I was running the
pump on for 45 minutes and off for 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes every hour and both of those
methods worked well for me but the 24 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: a day method worked just as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got our cloner filled up with
fresh cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna run overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow we need to check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overnight, that purple cloning solution
which we dunked the cuttings in is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be washed off of the plants and it's
going to end up in our reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our water, in our cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make the pH go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to check the pH first thing in
the morning and correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be surprised if the pH has jumped
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because all of that purple stuff
dripped off of the plants and it is now in
[SPEAKER_00]: your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just simply adjust the pH up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a few drops of a reliable pH up or
down product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use some home remedy or some cheapo
product for your cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cloner, we need a reliable pH up or
pH down product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend a reliable pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy a cheap pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get what you pay for when it comes to
pH testing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cuttings are going to live in this
cloner for approximately 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to check on them every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things we need to check
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we should check on is
general plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they standing up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting yellow and crinkly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see any spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see any spider mite damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see any spider mite webbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the plants show any sign of stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give a nice visual inspection of the
plants every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I suggest you check is the
pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the pump plugged in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the pump working properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump is basically the heart of that
machine, so make sure it is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I recommend you check is
the water level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the water level just below the halo?
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're in there, why not check the
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not check the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not check the EC of the water in
your cloner?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your pens, grab your meters,
give it a little test, and write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've made sure the pump is
working, you've checked the water level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've checked the EC, you've checked the
pH, and you've checked the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put the lid back on, and then I
would remove one of the collars and put my
[SPEAKER_00]: finger in there and make sure that the
water is spraying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look inside the hole while that neoprene
is gone and see if you can see that all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are getting sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that neoprene disc back, and if you're
brave, lift up the edge of the cloner and
[SPEAKER_00]: look inside and make sure that sprayer is
hitting everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to give a visual inspection to each
emitter inside of that machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an easy cloner,
you've probably got the red emitters in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure none of those are clogged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the Botanicure Turbo
Cloner, I think that comes with yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure none of those are clogged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do find that you've got a clogged
emitter, you've got to find something real
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny to poke down in the hole and try to
unclog it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to take the emitter all
the way out of the halo to poke it and
[SPEAKER_00]: unclog it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things get very brittle and they
break very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on unscrewing one,
I recommend you have a backup on hand
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a good chance it's going
to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, while you're thinking about it
right now, just go to Amazon and order a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of replacements because those emitters
get broken all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really frustrating when
you're setting up your machine and you
[SPEAKER_00]: break two of them and you can't run your
cloner because you've got two busted
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frustrating part is you've got to wait
for them to get shipped to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy some now and then you've got them for
when you do break them because I promise
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you're going to break a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our everyday inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember we talked about the clear res
earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got what I like to call the fifth
day check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every five days we need to add more clear
res to our cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to put 30 milliliters of clear res
for every five gallons of water in that
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier I suggested we check the EC
and the pH of our res every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is required is that we check it every
fifth day.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least make sure you check the pH and
the EC every five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it go longer than that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that without checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're in there adding clear res
anyway, unplug the pump, lift up the lid,
[SPEAKER_00]: put your pH meter and your EC meter in
there and just check it and see what it
[SPEAKER_00]: says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then add your clear res in there,
put the lid back on, plug it in and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: business as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the EC has gotten too low, add a little
bit of the clonex solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pH is out of whack, adjust it
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always adjust the pH after you add the
clonex solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever find that the water level has
gotten too low, we need to add water and
[SPEAKER_00]: when we add water, we need to add,
of course, clonex solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to adjust the EC somewhere between
1.0 and 1.2 when we add clonex solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add water and clonex solution,
of course we need to adjust the pH again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always keep the pH between 5.8 and 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a random tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep calling the top of the cloner the
lid or the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep changing up the name for it,
but the top of the cloner has your
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're taking off that top to work
on the water, be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the bottoms of your
clones are sticking out of the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: that cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in there exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to slide that cloner
across the top of the clone machine
[SPEAKER_00]: diagonally to make it rest across the
cloner, don't let it fall to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottoms of those cuttings hit the edge of
the cloner and get broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be safest to lift the top off and
just set it down on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to drip water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to drip stuff onto the table or
wherever you set it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you won't crush the bottoms of the
cuttings because the cloner is tall enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you turn it diagonal across the base of
the clone machine, across the reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the cloner, you do run the risk
of tipping it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that angle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other guy moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push it one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fall off a corner and you will break
a lot of cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that those cuttings are
exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sticking out of the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing work on the cloner
itself, don't forget about the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you lift it up like it's a
hatchback, if you just lift it up to look
[SPEAKER_00]: inside there, keep in mind you're probably
pushing some of those clones directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that T5 light hanging right
above your cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you lift it, those clones on the
edge closest towards you, they're moving
[SPEAKER_00]: right up and they're getting pushed into
the light above you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the root base part of
your cuttings and pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: part sticking out of the top of the cloner
when you're working on the inside of your
[SPEAKER_00]: clone machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these cuttings, which are going to
turn into clones, will lift
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the top of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the roots are going to start
popping out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 10, you should have nice roots
coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then by day 14, you should have a start of
a little spaghetti factory just coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bottom of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should look like a little set of
dreadlocks hanging off of each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when it is time to take our new
clones and put them into their soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: into their cocoa, or into their hydro
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that feels like a perfect spot to start
wrapping up this lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already promised that in a very soon
to come episode I would talk about putting
[SPEAKER_00]: our seedlings and clones into cocoa or
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only part left to talk about now is
cleaning our cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you are done with the cloner,
we need to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start by draining all of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I fill it up again with fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also add two or three cups of bleach,
depending on the size of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I plug it in and I let it run
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, I drain all of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not using permaclone clone collars,
I throw the collars away and by freshies,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I've got permaclones, I follow their
instructions on how to sanitize and reuse
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take the cloner outside and I spray
it down really well with the hose to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of that bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it apart completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the pump apart and I clean the pump
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to clean if you take it
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little toothbrush or a little brush
and just scrub it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use a paper clip or something
similar to clean out all of the emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, like I said earlier,
have extra emitters on hand because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you start taking them out, they're going
to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get brittle and they get especially
more brittle after you run bleach through
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean everything up, then put it all
back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is ready for use the next time you
need clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, our easy
cloners, our turbo cloners, never got a
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the guys could empty them,
I had two more guys carrying them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hosing them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they got brought in,
I had cuttings cut and ready to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: those cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never get a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never get a break in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my lesson on
cutting clones.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 365 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www

[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the episodes off by
letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of this
bubble jack full spectrum extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I love the flavor and aroma of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like bubble gum and cotton
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I dab it, it goes straight to my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my brain go super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my mouth go super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this will be a great
concentrate for smoking before a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too deep into this episode,
I want to give a few people a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to my friend,
Jake Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a shout out to Jade, and also a big
shout out to Grimbold the Druid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a shout out to Tanner
Martinowick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing a long series of grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have been following along.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested, I recommend you go
back to episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I start this long series of
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start there and get caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're up to speed,
welcome to the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last two episodes, we talked about
sprouting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talked about cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
putting those seeds and those clones into
[SPEAKER_00]: containers of soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about germinating in paper
towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have covered this briefly in the
previous episode, but we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it a little bit of a recap right
here just to make sure everybody is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We folded a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We soaked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put seeds on the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We folded it again to secure the seeds
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we put that in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we put that in a warm place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds have now sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they've got little tiny tails,
maybe a quarter of an inch, maybe a half
[SPEAKER_00]: inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you didn't go any more than one
inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is how I recommend planting those
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally try to stay away from
recommending products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I recommend a product,
I get emails from people saying I did
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong, but I want to make this
easy for everybody, so I recommend Light
[SPEAKER_00]: Warrior Soil from Fox Farms for your new
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is affordable, and it works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure other people will have other
ideas and other suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend this product because,
like I said, it's available, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable, and I know that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to send people on some crazy
mission looking for a product that's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to find or overpriced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably get away with one bag of
Light Warrior Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need containers to put this soil in
to put our seedlings in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend small pots for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to fill up a big
three-gallon pot and then plant a little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny seedling in there, and then you have
to water that entire space of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to put water and nutrients in all
of that space just to water that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your seedling inside of a
little tiny cup, you only have to water
[SPEAKER_00]: that much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to waste water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to waste nutrients,
and you don't have to waste space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new growers really like to drown
seedlings in larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they put a seedling in a larger pot,
they've got to water all of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go and they pour an entire pitcher
of water right on top of that three-gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that seedling gets washed away in all
that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where it goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people apply water, they do it kind
of heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed gets washed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets lost in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kill the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fail with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend starting with a
smaller pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a four-inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a six-inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a four-inch square pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a six-inch circular pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly start my seedlings in a beer
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a few beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stack them up on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put a drill through the bottom of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go through about eight cups at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I poke one big hole through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll do a few smaller holes on the
side just to give some proper drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like beer cups are the perfect size
for new baby seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings can sprout in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can develop a good root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they get big enough,
you can just up-pot them into their three-
[SPEAKER_00]: or five-gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about actually putting these
seedlings into ... I'm going to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: the beer cup for this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my Light Warrior soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fill my beer cup most of the
way up with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pack it down fairly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to fill it up with soil and
leave myself about a quarter of an inch so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I water, I've got plenty of room
for water and it doesn't just run off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about a quarter inch of space
left on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I water that soil before I even put
my clone or my seedling into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're going to put a
seedling in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm going with the seedling,
I do not use any nutrients at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let all that water soak through the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take my pointer finger and I dig a
little hole just right to the first
[SPEAKER_00]: knuckle of my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put that little freshly sprouted
seedling right inside that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seedling has developed a long tail,
that taproot, if that taproot has gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: long, you need to make that be facing down
and the seed facing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the seed coming up and the
taproot going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gently place that seed facing down or
the taproot facing down, the seed pointing
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place that right in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dig the hole as deep as you need to dig it
if you've got a longer taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push your finger in there as long as
you need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then gently set that taproot down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just want to put the dirt right
over it real gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that it's covered up toward
the light's not getting to it and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: packed in there tight enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water it the next time,
that water will probably pack it just
[SPEAKER_00]: tight enough for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to press it down too much
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to risk crushing that
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a real short tail,
just go knuckle deep, drop that little
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling right in there and bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got kind of a long tail,
you've got to dig a little deeper of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set that tail down in there and then just
carefully bury that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be really careful not to disturb that
white taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really delicate and it's important
that it is not disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your new seedlings are basically
potted in their cups of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would place them under a T5 light with
the T5 light about 8 to 12 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to keep them around 75 to 85
degrees and I would try to keep it quite
[SPEAKER_00]: humid around these little tiny baby
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes time to water these new
seedlings, we have to be very careful for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend using a sprayer to water new
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a tiny one gallon pump sprayer from
the local hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix it with my whatever nutrient
solution I'm going to use or just plain
[SPEAKER_00]: water that's been pH balanced correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pump it real hard and I just spray
the top soil with that water instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: pouring a heavy dose of water in and
risking drowning those seeds or disrupting
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spray it from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of spray it at a few angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I get all the soil saturated and
it works just like the morning dew would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like spraying them is really
gentle and it works really well for new
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to not drown these plants and not
flood the soil when they're starting baby
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's briefly talk about when to start
feeding our seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start feeding when I see the
first set of truly developed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the first set of five or
seven or nine, depending on what variety
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing, when you see the first set
of full leaves, that's when I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: start adding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your brand and your product,
I usually recommend you start with about a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottle says to use 40 milliliters
of a certain product, I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you start with 10 milliliters of that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as that plant gets bigger,
and stronger, and more developed,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can increase your nutrient
feedings to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while they're small, let's feed them
lightly so we don't roast them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about what to feed
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants need a little bit of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a very small amount of
phosphorus and a very small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your basic grow nutrients will be
just fine for small seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend adding a root inoculant
product, something like mammoth pea,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like great white, something like
recharge, something like Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of those products will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little bit of research, find what's
available in your area, find what fits
[SPEAKER_00]: your price range, and get the product that
will work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is better than nothing when it
comes to root inoculants and microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it for small plants,
and I highly recommend it throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your plants are little,
they're not going to need a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, just a base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend some sort of root
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't need Kalmag, probably until we
transplant them into the next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to add a fulvic or a humic
acid, that's always good for the plants at
[SPEAKER_00]: all stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, I mainly like to focus
on healthy plants with strong roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really focus on root development at
this stage of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add microbes and beneficial fungus,
and then I'll also add carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, like I said,
I am mainly focusing on root development
[SPEAKER_00]: until I transplant those plants into their
next pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked a little bit about what to
feed these little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: For small seedlings, I like to keep my pH
around 5.8 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get a little bit larger,
I will increase the pH slowly and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: move up towards 6.3 or 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for these small babies, let's stay
closer to 5.8 or 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now really take your time increasing the
amount of nutrients you give these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and also take your time increasing the pH
of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get a root system to be able
to process all of the stuff you're giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little tiny plants don't want a lot
and you do run the risk of burning them if
[SPEAKER_00]: you overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention and go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after several days, these seedlings
will start taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting full size leaves and
they will start catching up to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: size as the clones we cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they reach that size, I consider them
to be small veg plants and I treat them
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I do my small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will talk about caring for and
feeding small veg plants here in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, let's talk about planting our rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we planted some seedlings in rapid
rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we cut some clones into rapid
rooters and put them in a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are sprouting roots and it is
time to plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know when it is time to plant
our rapid rooters, seedlings or clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to plant seedlings as soon as I see
that first taproot coming out of the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to let that taproot get too
long, too leggy and too stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do my best to get those into soil
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut clones, and rapid rooters,
I like to make sure they are sufficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: rooted before I try to put them into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your clones are properly
hardened off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to expose our domed clones to
fresh air for durations of time and extend
[SPEAKER_00]: that duration over a period of time to
make sure the clones are ready to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: in a humidity controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get them used to being in our
regular veg environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been hardening off our clones and
they show sufficient roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by sufficient roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want at least five maybe 10 or 12 white
thick roots popping out of that rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be just busting out of
there and kind of thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to look like they're just
little worms coming out looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more than five, maybe more
than 12 and they start building up in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you are really doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to develop a nice root system
before we pot it, but there is a fine line
[SPEAKER_00]: between just enough and too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lift that little clone up out of
that tray and the roots have begun
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping around the rooter, you've gone
too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those roots are hanging down inside the
rooter tray and hanging into the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gone too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get those into our soilless mix
as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want just a little bit of dreadlocks
just hanging out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot, just maybe a little tiny mop,
just a little fuzz ball, maybe 10 or 20 of
[SPEAKER_00]: them just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is prime time to pot those and I want
them about a half inch to an inch and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half long is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put these rapid rooters into our
beer cup full of Light Warrior soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever size pot and whatever soil makes
you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure it's a quality soil mix
with plenty of aeration and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever size or whatever container you
use has plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want our plants to get muddy at
the bottom, get stagnant water that will
[SPEAKER_00]: totally drown and destroy our roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quality soil, pots with good drainage,
that is a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just like we did the beer cups for
our small seedlings, let's fill them up
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil and leave ourselves about a
quarter of an inch of space for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I'm putting the seedlings in the
rapid rooters, into this soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I most likely will not give them nutrients
at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put the clones into the soil at
this time, I do like to give them a small
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a light vegetative mix, about a
quarter strength of whatever brand you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using, use about a quarter strength of
whatever they recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to use a micro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something like mammoth pea,
something like great white shark,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like recharge, something like
plus life from veg bloom, anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus and bacteria that will
encourage root growth will be great for
[SPEAKER_00]: your small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our light base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a root inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep the pH for these small
clones somewhere between 5.8 and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a root inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our solution pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I water that solution through my cups
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pour it right on through until it
drains out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fully saturate that new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once it's done dripping and that soil
is fully saturated, I will take two
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers and just gently make a little hole
right in the center of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go just a little bit deeper than the
height of that rapid rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the rapid rooter is an inch tall,
I go maybe an inch and one eighth or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch and a quarter deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get the rapid rooter out of the
little tray and I set it gently inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do my best to not disrupt any of
those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a seedling, you've probably only
got one or two roots sticking out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gently set that in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it right inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then backfill that hole really carefully
over that rapid rooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go right over the top of it so
you can never tell the rapid rooter was
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just a little plant is sticking
up out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be really careful if you're working with
the seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one taproot is all it's got to
survive through at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with a clone,
we still need to be very careful with
[SPEAKER_00]: these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, wear rubber gloves when you're
doing all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend rubber gloves whenever
you're coming in contact when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting your hands or your skin in contact
with the dirt, with the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to wear rubber gloves if you can
or latex gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to glove up whenever possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still suggest watering that rapid
rooter seedling with the spray bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I recommended before,
until it gets nice and large, until you're
[SPEAKER_00]: confident that you're not going to drown
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water it with that spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you fully saturate the soil,
but it's easier to not go overboard when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're spraying with the spray bottle
because you can only spray so much at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower and you don't have
a lot of experience watering plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're new at watering the clones,
don't be afraid to water them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: spray bottle also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and saturate that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep spraying until you feel like it's
saturated and then wait until it's fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: dry to water it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know when it feels real light when
you pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, oh, that needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just soak it until it's mostly
saturated again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you'll realize that you're
spending too much time using that spray
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle to water the clones and you'll
start using a more efficient method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great way to learn how to not
overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically fill my cup with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moisten the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a little hole with my fingers and I
set that rapid router right inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: hole really gently, really careful not to
damage any of those new roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I carefully bury that rapid router
with the moist soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put that cup underneath a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I like to keep that light eight to
12 inches above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're brand new like this,
I don't want to scorch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to keep the temperature
somewhere between 75 and 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to keep the room fairly humid
when I have new seedlings or young plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is really quickly how I put my
rapid router seedlings and clones into
[SPEAKER_00]: cups of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk next about putting our clones
from an easy cloner machine or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare turbo cloner into cups of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: My method for potting these clones into
soil starts the same as potting our seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or potting our rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start by filling my cup or my desired
container with light warrior or my desired
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-less mix about a quarter inch away
from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then saturate that soil the same as I
did with my other cloning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use about a quarter strength of my
vegetative new and I like to use plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I adjust the pH between 5.8 and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we cut these clones, I said to
leave about an inch underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: neoprene collar into the water getting hit
by that sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entire inch should have roots popping
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a nice little mop of roots
before we try to pot these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my cup of moistened soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a well-rooted clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I usually grab the cup with my right
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the pointer finger on my left hand
and I just poke a hole about an inch and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half deep right into that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I may widen that hole up a little bit
depending on the root mass coming off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are a lot of roots, I need more
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to crowd or crush the roots
into that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to lower the clone down into the
soil and let those roots spread as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got something hanging off,
try not to squish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to coil them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to encourage those roots to spread
out as far as they can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of roots, maybe make a
small cone of soil in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup, a little triangle so that the roots
can hit that triangle and spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: around that instead of getting into a
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the roots spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we tangle them up, if we twist them,
they'll just suffocate themselves and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will kill the plant and the clone will not
survive at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your roots have gotten excessively
long, I recommend you trim some off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're more than six or seven inches
long, just go ahead and trim the bottoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of those roots off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will thank you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't have so much root mass twisted
up in the bottom of that cup trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just have a nice thick root mass
started and it works a little bit like
[SPEAKER_00]: topping your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just created more sections for that
root zone to branch out from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pop that clone up out of the easy
cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the neoprene disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the neoprene disc off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put that back in the hole so the water
doesn't go spraying anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got the cloner turned on
while you're potting the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you take that clone and you just set
it right inside that hole that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: created in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you lower it down into there,
try to spread the roots out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're just short and stubby,
they're going to go the direction they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting long enough to where
you can stretch them or move them and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage them which direction to go,
try to make them spread out like an
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get them nice and far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're really long, you can put soil
in the cup lower some of the roots down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sprinkle more soil on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lower more roots down into the cup
and then sprinkle more soil on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then no matter how much soil you use,
no matter how long the roots are,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to bury that clone deep enough
into this cup to give it some support to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the soil tight enough
around it and get it deep enough in there
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the clone to support itself and
stand straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we need to not bury
it so deep that we cause root rot on that
[SPEAKER_00]: short stem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put one inch of it underneath the
neoprene disc getting sprayed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got roots about one inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that neoprene disc is about a quarter
of an inch deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say probably plant it somewhere
between one and a quarter and one and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half inches deep into your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've already moistened the soil so
the nutrients are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to do is to move our potted
clones underneath a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for freshly potted plants,
I like to keep that T5 about eight to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will lower that light as the plants get
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to move them right under
there right away and scorch them and burn
[SPEAKER_00]: them and give them the opportunity to
stress out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these new baby clones, I like to keep
the temperature between 75 and 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do like high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much airflow I've got in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got plenty of airflow,
if I can have air exchange, I will put
[SPEAKER_00]: higher humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel like there's not a lot of
airflow and it will create problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will reduce the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep stressing it, but the most
important thing to think about when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are potting these clones from the easy
cloner, from the turbo cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to not let those dangly roots wrap up
on themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them smother themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them suffocate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cloning machines can make roots
explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look in there on day five and you
won't have any roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look in there on day six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be getting roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go away for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll come back over the weekend on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are hanging down into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go crazy very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see what I'm talking about when
you get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take those fat clones with big crazy
roots and kill them by suffocating them,
[SPEAKER_00]: by coiling them up in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we've got a bunch of
seedlings or a bunch of clones in small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots or cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them underneath T5 lights or
whatever light you've got available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a small HPS, maybe a 250
or a 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using something larger that
works, just keep it further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just raise it up real high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got it under an acceptable light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it in a desirable climate,
which is around 75 to 85 degrees with the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got somewhere between 50
and 75% humidity for your small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest either 24 hours on or
possibly 20 on and four off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a lot of people like to do 18 hours on
and six hours off for our new small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend a light fan on
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a fan to keep the air moving around
them will prevent the plants from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: leggy and stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it just makes tougher,
more robust plants when you put a little
[SPEAKER_00]: breeze on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, the clones are now in
our small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very short time, those seedlings will
catch up to what I consider the small veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, which is when they're about six
inches tall and they've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: nice sets of leaves and they can start
taking small veg nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on doing a complete episode on
small veg here in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode will include recommended
light cycles for your veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode will include recommended
nutrient schedules for your veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also talk about optimal environmental
conditions for your small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about transplanting our
plants into their finishing pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will consider that large veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will begin the talk about our
large veg phase.
