[SPEAKER_00]: on the screen And you know I did include a
link in the show notes and the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it nice and easy for
all of my friends Welcome to the show
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try to make it through that intro
without having to clear my throat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm nice and baked I'm plenty lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some fat Dabs of some arise
live batter that was made by a friend who
[SPEAKER_00]: would rather remain anonymous We don't
need to talk about who made that or how
[SPEAKER_00]: that got here But if you are listening if
you're watching this show, bro The arise
[SPEAKER_00]: live batter that I got from you has me in
some kind of way The dabs hit so
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully it tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It punched me right in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely hit me in the chest It's got
my eyes heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my eyes are I got some sort of
weights on my eyelids or something I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like my brain is in a little bit of a
tunnel It is a beautiful experience It
[SPEAKER_00]: does have my throat and lungs a little bit
fucked up, but we'll get through this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast together anyway If you wonder why
I'm a little bit goofy here at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of the show Shout out to my friend who
made the arise live batter that stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious and beautiful unfortunately I've
been smoked at all so it's time for more
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you I did appreciate it,
but next time bro send a bigger jar you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys it is getting nice outside I Enjoyed
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bit Beautiful day the Sun has
been shining we are kind of evolving into
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring Coming out of the cold winter
season getting into the spring working our
[SPEAKER_00]: way toward the summer What are you doing
to prepare your grows for all these
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature swings all this chaos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for this is your garden
going to have powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, are you ready for outdoor season?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are already in April when I'm recording
this it is now in April Are you ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: the outdoor season if you're not it is
time to get ready So let's get that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room dialed in for the spring summer
season Set up let's get ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor season it is time to get prepared
for all of that stuff 420 is coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies and gentlemen What are we gonna do
for 420 this year while we are on a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we still gonna be locked down?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we gonna do 420 again last year's
420 was a little bit weird I miss going to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the events going and seeing all my
friends It's been a long time since I've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a dab in a big group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a weird year What are you
gonna do this year for 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have planned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you gonna?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that people are getting vaccinated now
that the things are opening up rules are
[SPEAKER_00]: changing people aren't so paranoid Is it
going to be a different year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will 420 be different?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made any plans yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on I'm not ready
to go out into big crowds yet Even if the
[SPEAKER_00]: the pandemic is chilled out the virus is
kind of settled down a little bit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know I'm not getting political on
that even when that does kind of chill out
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still kind of worried about people
people are gonna be acting kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how to behave themselves
in public yet I'm gonna give people a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of time to go out and adjust
and get their shit back together Remember
[SPEAKER_00]: how to behave in a large group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember their manners Let those weird
incidents just get out of the way before I
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce myself back into the population
What are you doing for 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know send me a tweet at rasta
Jeff 420 or at GF YH podcast on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter You can message me on Instagram or
of course send me an email grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart at hotmail.com I know one thing
we're going to do some drops and 420 sales
[SPEAKER_00]: for 420 That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about quite a bit online
Those will drop at certain vendors that
[SPEAKER_00]: has not been planned arranged or set up
completely yet still in the works when I
[SPEAKER_00]: have solid details You will be the first
to get info.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be fresh drops on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some seed sales There will
be some merchandise sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for that one of the best ways
to stay updated on that Of course is to
[SPEAKER_00]: sign up for the newsletter on my website
at irygenetics.com Halfway down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little newsletter spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says stay up to date Type in your name
or your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put your name in there Put your
email address in there hit send then you
[SPEAKER_00]: will be on the email list when I do Set up
the sale update the coupon codes all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get an email You will know what's
on sale what you need to shop for what's
[SPEAKER_00]: about to drop Also, I'll let you know if
I'm gonna be on other podcasts other shows
[SPEAKER_00]: if I have other events coming Sign up for
the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will be beneficial for you All
right, I feel like my lungs and my throat
[SPEAKER_00]: are almost catching up from those
ridiculous stabs that I took my Head is
[SPEAKER_00]: still not caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you could tell my eyes are
super droopy from The dabs and these
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are really killing me today you
guys so thank you for hanging out I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having as much fun as I am I did
say that I was going to read some patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and some grow questions So let's
cut the chatter and get right to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: of this podcast I've got a bunch of great
grow questions in front of me in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode I did say that I got a bunch of
short questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to catch up on I've got a couple
of those in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says I've got a Breeder question
it says I have a feminized seed for a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that I really like and I want to
cross her with a rise pollen Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you've got a feminized seed that you
really like and you want to cross it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the rise That's completely acceptable
taking a rise male put the pollen on it
[SPEAKER_00]: that will work A lot of people ask about
breeding with feminized seeds do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing There's nothing wrong
with breeding with plants that came from a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed The next part of the
question says is there any reason or can
[SPEAKER_00]: it even be done for a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: To achieve a male version of an original
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very good question Where do we
start here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to talk about in
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is can a breeder basically
make a male female seed they want a male
[SPEAKER_00]: selection from a batch of seeds from a
seed that is only a Feminized seed line or
[SPEAKER_00]: we will go back and talk about that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before called clone only So if
you've got a clone only plant and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna touch on clone only Really briefly
because I've already done an episode about
[SPEAKER_00]: this but when we say clone only what we
mean Is that plant is not available in
[SPEAKER_00]: seed form or at least it wasn't available
in seed form until we had Feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in and somebody made it and fem
seed then it was available So let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: pick a strain one of my favorites to talk
about and this will put me on a good rant
[SPEAKER_00]: is Gorilla glue number four There is not a
male of gorilla glue number four gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: glue number four was a phenotype of a
batch of Gorilla glue seeds and it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: number four phenotype in that batch number
four was a female It's the one that got
[SPEAKER_00]: popular that got spread out that everybody
smokes that everybody loves So there is
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla glue number four is a clone Only
the breeder of that never put out any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the original seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't let out other phenotypes He did
not let out a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only a female phenotype of the
gorilla glue number four Which is number
[SPEAKER_00]: four and it is a clone only so that's
where we're gonna start with clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here's one way that I like to
explain clone only that everybody will
[SPEAKER_00]: understand Let's say that we discovered an
animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one of them We have found one
of these animals and it's a female So
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got and we're gonna name this animal
just for the sake of this conversation I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to name this animal gorilla glue
number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of this animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's walking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pooping It's an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female its name is gorilla glue
number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make more of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't Because we don't have a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mammal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have some sort of and it's got
to have sperm and an egg It's got to have
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without the other part of that
reproduction, we cannot make more So now
[SPEAKER_00]: that animal is basically clone only
there's only one of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't reproduce it Whoever created it
didn't give us more seeds or more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got the one so it's gonna be
the only one Luckily with plants we can
[SPEAKER_00]: make clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's clone only but that one animal
that's the only one that there is you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't reproduce That the only way it can
be reproduced is through clone clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: is the only way that that plant is
available So that's what I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: when I say clone only that's why I like to
pick gorilla glue number four Because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a specific phenotype if somebody tells
you they've got seeds of gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_00]: number four There's something done to
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either feminized or it's been
adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a back cross It is something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that talks about clone only now the
question is can it be done if a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: only?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had a clone only and I wanted to
make seeds of it Let's talk about golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat now because this has actually
happened People wanted golden goat seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat is clone only the original
golden goat was not released in any seed
[SPEAKER_00]: form No males were put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of phenotypes that
were released of the golden goat One was
[SPEAKER_00]: called the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one was called the funky bitch
There were others that were never sought
[SPEAKER_00]: after and very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the golden goat was the one that was
spread around It's a clone only until I
[SPEAKER_00]: got my hands on it other people have done
this too But I'm saying until I got my
[SPEAKER_00]: grubby little paws on it and everybody was
like dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want golden goat seeds I want golden
goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed it and made feminized golden
goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the seeds were available It is not
clone only but now what those are is
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat s1 seeds They are self s1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Pete's gonna say they are f1s,
but they are feminized s1 self seeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat they will be Very very
close representations of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat female, but there will be some
variation You will find phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are complete mirrors of that original mom
You will also find phenotypes that are a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit different in some ways want to
look more like mommy You want to look a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more like daddy, but you're
going to find a lot that looked just like
[SPEAKER_00]: the original mom now It's important that
we label that golden goat s1 because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not the original golden goat It is not the
clone only it is misleading to say That
[SPEAKER_00]: that is golden goat if you're giving the
clones out to somebody else to grow if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just growing it in your garden
You're growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're enjoying it label it whatever you
want But if you're going to pass that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone on make sure people know that that
was a golden goat clone from your
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seed stock not from my original
golden goat stock or mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank's original golden goat stock All
right, so we've gotten to clone only now
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gotten to feminize seeds now The
question is is there a way for a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: To achieve a male version of the original
feminized seed This is where we work into
[SPEAKER_00]: a back cross a back cross is the closest
representation that we can pull out from a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed to achieve a male that will
look like the plant we're looking for for
[SPEAKER_00]: our breeding project a back cross is often
labeled BX a back cross is also commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled BC Which I'm learning may be the
correct term.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adulterating and fucking upturned
Here in the cannabis industry and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do another conversation about
that very soon But you will see BX or BC
[SPEAKER_00]: that means back cross There will also be a
number after those letters if it's just BX
[SPEAKER_00]: or BC It is a back cross number one if you
see the BX or BC and then a number it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: BX to back cross to back cross three back
cross four which is a different generation
[SPEAKER_00]: and working of the back cross in an effort
to stabilize the traits which we are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for isolate the plant we're
looking for and remove the other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: traits which we adulterated this plant
with to create the seeds Now let's talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this adulteration I'm talking about
We want to make seeds regular seeds from a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant which we have only got feminized
seed stock So we're starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds Grow those seeds find the
one that you like find your phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: suits your project the best I'm gonna say
we're working with golden goat because I
[SPEAKER_00]: have done this and it is easy to follow
this example So I have I have the original
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat I want to make regular seeds
of golden goat, but it's clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've only got that female There
isn't a boy to play with I've got to find
[SPEAKER_00]: something to Pollinate my golden goat with
to make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is how I Approached a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to do this This is
how I did it and why I did it and I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna talk about it And I am open to your
criticism and I'm excited to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what I did my goal My goal was to
create Golden goat back cross seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: closely represented the original golden
goat when grown without being Feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: because many people are not fans of
feminized seeds the way I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the original golden goat female I
took a male plant that was completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different from that golden goat in every
way It was different Excuse the throat
[SPEAKER_00]: clearing you guys I apologize for that not
gonna edit it out cuz I'm on a fat flow
[SPEAKER_00]: Did take some fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the original Golden goat I
pollinated that with a male plant that was
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different from golden goat in
every way It was different in aroma flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz But most importantly structure and
leaf shape when growing these two plants I
[SPEAKER_00]: could vastly see that this plant had long
skinny pointy sharp serrated edge leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and it grew tall and are not super tall
but it stayed kind of squatty but it got
[SPEAKER_00]: tall and sativa like and I could really
see that plant structure in the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat golden goat has a very Unique growth
and it once you grow it you'll see it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's noticeable from across the
room The other plant that I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with was an og cush dominant plant I used
a daybreaker male, which is Joseph og and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim D I may have done that backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Kim D female to a Joseph og male
So I took that daybreaker male and I used
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen from that daybreaker the
daybreaker had gigantic leaves So the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat had long skinny leaves that
were real sharp the daybreaker had leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: that You could pull the leaves off and
build a canopy and fucking camp out
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves were so big They worked like
umbrellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could shade the whole house the whole
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could build a village with those
leaves They were so big The golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: was real sturdy and grew really quickly
that daybreaker was a little spindly Kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of og cushy if you know anything about
growing an og cush plant it had that
[SPEAKER_00]: serious og cush going on to it So I then
pollinated the golden goat female with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from the original Daybreaker male
now we've got seeds this batch of seeds is
[SPEAKER_00]: where King Solomon came from but that's
another story We'll talk about that later
[SPEAKER_00]: from this batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected a male that looks Exactly like
the golden goat and we'll talk about how I
[SPEAKER_00]: did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Found a plant that had long skinny
leaves that when I rubbed the stem it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled just like the female golden goat
when I rubbed the stem So that's telling
[SPEAKER_00]: me I've got a really really good match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Looking for leaf shape and I went
as far as to take the leaves off of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and hold them over the leaves on
this plant So I've got the leaves and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: matching them up like puzzle pieces To
find the plant the male plant that made
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves that look just like that
original golden goat Now my goal my idea
[SPEAKER_00]: was to find a male plant that carried all
of those golden goat traits But did not
[SPEAKER_00]: look like the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I chose a plant that was so
Vastly different from the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically was mixing red And blue
marbles in a jar and I'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the blue marbles again later when I
went looking for my phenotype There were
[SPEAKER_00]: so far apart in visual appearance that it
was really obvious which phenotypes were
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat It was really obvious which
phenotypes were daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I searched through those I grew out a
lot of male plants My main goal for this
[SPEAKER_00]: project was to find King Solomon is who I
was looking for but along the way I found
[SPEAKER_00]: a golden goat keeper that was fucking
perfect in my opinion It grew just like
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat female if I put them
side-by-side This male and this female in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg and let them grow for the first like
four or five weeks They would mimic each
[SPEAKER_00]: other They would start to change a little
bit closer to flower because the male and
[SPEAKER_00]: the female start doing a little bit
different things in flower But they looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked like fucking clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked like twins of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super excited So now I've got a male
that looks just like my original golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a male that is golden goat to
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 50% Golden goat 50% daybreaker,
but it looks so much like the golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to say It was like 70 to 80%
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that right It was really
close to golden goat so close to golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that golden goat male Alright,
I got a boy and I put that pollen on the
[SPEAKER_00]: original golden goat girl now we have got
the fur the pollen donor is like 70 to 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just say 75% it is three quarters
golden goat in my opinion By looks by
[SPEAKER_00]: smell by growth characteristics and then
we put that on a plant that is 100% golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat We've got like if you do the math on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna get the math perfectly It's
probably in the high 80s low 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of phenotypes that should look
just Like the original golden goat because
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of genetic that you put in
there is so much like the golden goat I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say it's probably 85% at least 75%
of the phenotypes that come out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are very very close Representations
of the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've told you my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you my goal I told you my method
and I told you what I did and I told you
[SPEAKER_00]: how it came out the BX one or the BC one
the back-cross one looks very Very close
[SPEAKER_00]: to that original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what I could should maybe will do
in the future I've got so many projects in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind you guys that it's hard to keep up
with my own ideas what I want to do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future I want to grow a batch of those
golden goat back-cross one Seeds and now
[SPEAKER_00]: find another male in there that is even
closer to the original golden goat I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if I can get closer, but technically
there are more golden goat marbles in this
[SPEAKER_00]: mix than there are daybreaker marbles in
this mix by a long shot so maybe I can
[SPEAKER_00]: even narrow it down to get like 92% of the
phenotypes to look just like the original
[SPEAKER_00]: mom then I would repeat that process find
a male out of those seeds and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep pollinating that original golden goat
female so every Time I do this if I do it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly I'm getting closer and closer to
recreating that original golden goat by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time we get to the second third maybe
fourth back-cross They should come out
[SPEAKER_00]: very very uniform compared to that
original golden goat you guys I need a
[SPEAKER_00]: little drink of this coconut water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is itchy It's kind of dry from
the dabs, but I'm not ready to stop yet So
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna freshen up the voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna keep talking here Can it be
done or is there a reason yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be done it can be done by keep
back-crossing the Genetics will be what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be pure golden goat and
it is important as a seed seller if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving away clones if you're selling
trading sharing seeds make it known that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the golden goat back-cross and not
the original golden goat that is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important in my opinion as a Breeder as a
seed maker as a podcaster As the person in
[SPEAKER_00]: my position in the cannabis community
world industry, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got responsibilities I've got a huge
responsibility I've kind of dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: myself to being sort of a cannabis
historian.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is documented history.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is happening here I think it's partly
My responsibility, but also if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving out seeds sharing seeds,
it's your responsibility to keep this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis history Very genuine and very
true and very pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a drink because I really
need it
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take another drink because that
one was so good Shout out to the coconut
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me but I like it They
should pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Vita cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to send me some coconut water
I would take it also David GT's I drink
[SPEAKER_00]: two of those blue kombuchas every day bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to me All right, you guys shameless
advertising here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's paying me for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just having fun today really loving
podcasting Anyway, the reason for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be to achieve a non feminized
version of the golden goat seeds a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people have Deep founded hatred for
feminized seeds a lot of that in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion is miseducation a lot of That in
my opinion is people were making poor
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds Years ago years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to make feminized seeds that
just weren't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that did give them a bad reputation now
I feel like I understand how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the Selecting of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the process of creating
feminized pollen I understand the project
[SPEAKER_00]: of putting the two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do that So now I think
feminized seeds are much more reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better made the breeders are more
responsible They're more ethically sourced
[SPEAKER_00]: and better done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people have a lot of hatred
for fem seeds That is why we are making
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross seeds, but we've got to
adulterate that original cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The toss-up there is do you want
feminized seeds or slightly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Adulterated crosses to achieve the project
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because people don't want fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes through back crossing But then it is
adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I answered that question I
really went on about that one that got me
[SPEAKER_00]: on a good ramp Which I've needed I think
the audience enjoys when I get going like
[SPEAKER_00]: that So thank you for that one You did not
say if you wanted your name set on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show or not So I'm not gonna say it
because it's easier that way for both of
[SPEAKER_00]: us either way big shout out Thank you for
the great content big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are Let's move into the
next one because I'm awful freaking rambly
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it mathematically possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the updates that they sent
for this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Yes, it is mathematically possible to
create that mail but you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some Back-crossing they wrap that
message up with I am high Then they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of ask in a roundabout way if it's
possible to get a mail from a feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Yes, sometimes a mail will pop up in a
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very uncommon It's probably one in a
million to get a mail from a feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a line that I've worked with For
a little while now that it's a feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: project and about one in every 5,000 seeds
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how many Seeds were produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how many were put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many were grown So all
the reports can't be completely accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz I don't know people buy seeds and put
them in a drawer and stash them and hoard
[SPEAKER_00]: them and keep them like Pokemon cards and
don't grow them But I've seen two males
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up from one strain that is feminized
solid males Not sure how it's happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: but two people have sent me a picture of a
male and they're like, hey, these are fems
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I have a male that is genetics as a
breeder as a seed maker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that I'm toying with science
and nature and I make great selection I do
[SPEAKER_00]: my research I do my due diligence,
but it is nature You can train your dog to
[SPEAKER_00]: do all the tricks and all the fucking
magic you want that dog to do But one day
[SPEAKER_00]: that dog may shit right on the rug and
occasionally that stuff happens in life
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with seeds in nature and
there are anomalies here, but that Male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant popping up in fem seeds is probably
about one in a million to be quite honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with you and that's gonna happen That's
just genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that the cookie crumbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way the genetic dice roll goes
Like I said, you can have things perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: 9999 times or 999 times however many but
it's always that opportunity for one time
[SPEAKER_00]: for things to go weird No matter how good
your genetics are no matter how good your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project is something can go wrong
Maybe somebody's got a grow room with one
[SPEAKER_00]: magic fucking thing happening in there
that you never thought of and that weird
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental trigger will just bring out
something you've never seen as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway Yes, you can get a male it is very
uncommon one in a million to get that male
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a fema Nice seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I would breed with that
throw that away as a breeder I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: to just use that pollen just put it on a
couple of plants and then see what came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it Just because I'm a curious
breeder the I'm passionately curious the
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity in me is what keeps all of this
going All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read more questions because I'm
getting rambly This one says if seeds here
[SPEAKER_00]: now will not let me combine my discounts
on I read genetics purchases What breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: on seeds here now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend I spend my saved
points on?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um So our friend here is shopping on seeds
here now comm use coupon code GF Y H 10
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll save you 10% on your order But
when you're shopping at seeds here now
[SPEAKER_00]: comm you do acquire points you accrue
points is the word I think I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: use Every purchase you make earns you
points those points go to your account in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future You can use those points to
make purchases points toward purchases But
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not letting you combine discounts
if you use that coupon code GF Y H 10 you
[SPEAKER_00]: save 10% you count Also double dip and use
your points So my friend is asking are
[SPEAKER_00]: there any other breeders that you would
recommend I can spend my points on That is
[SPEAKER_00]: a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of puts me on the spot It's
kind of a weird question being friends
[SPEAKER_00]: with so many breeders so many seed makers
sellers I'm friends with all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to all of the events I look at all
the people shake their hands see their
[SPEAKER_00]: faces high five fist bumps hugs all around
So picking a couple of people to recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that you buy their stuff is really kind of
putting me on the spot but I chose a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple people that I would recommend for
you because their crosses have my
[SPEAKER_00]: attention the Plants they're working with
the starting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing breeding with the plants
They have been working with back crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: f2ing their stock is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcome from their stock has always
been great I like the turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the people so let's talk a little
bit about Breeders that I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a breeder that kind of snuck up
out of nowhere Came out of nowhere
[SPEAKER_00]: recently probably the last couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of things I really think that
Seattle chronic needs more attention if
[SPEAKER_00]: you had some points to spend I would give
Seattle chronic a chance on some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of great stuff I've
talked to them on a couple of podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the way that they do things lots of
selection lots of rigorous testing Lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas going into their projects lots of
thought So check out Seattle chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend them good people Great
projects good seeds then check out exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic Mike has got some good shit you
guys I like what exotic Mike breeds Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: and I aren't even like best of friends
exotic Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see each other at events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that What's up, bro, but we're both
so busy that it's just like a hey there he
[SPEAKER_00]: is Hey, there he is and we keep moving
because our booths are hopping but exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike makes good shit There's a reason why
that dude's got a fucking table full of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups when you go to the events
shop with exotic Mike You can't go wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: Another breeder that I like and I like his
attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like his style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like him as a person and that sounds
weird It sounds like I got a fucking man
[SPEAKER_00]: crush on the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the guy I like the way that
if he wants to compliment you you'll get a
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment Also, if he needs to tell you
to go fuck yourself, he will flat-out tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you hey go fuck yourself But I want to
give a shout out to JJ from top dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend top dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good seeds I am breeding with
the chemdela chemdela Chem the chemd to
[SPEAKER_00]: I-95 is a fucking great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows super vigorous It makes trichomes
and veg that is a good fucking plant So
[SPEAKER_00]: also the exotic Mike I bred with the
cookies and cream number 13 that plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking amazing That is what made the
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with these guys projects I
haven't worked with I haven't bred with
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle chronic seeds yet, but that may
happen in the future they do CBD leaning
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and a whole bunch of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their breeding is a little bit Not what
I'm doing, which is totally fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do recommend them good shit Then I
would be doing everybody a disservice if I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't say to get yourself some seeds from
miss Jill Miss Jill is putting out some
[SPEAKER_00]: great crosses lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is available on seeds here now I would
definitely say get some stuff from miss
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill then I've got to recommend another
Colorado boy People are gonna send me
[SPEAKER_00]: thumbs up and thumbs downs for this
recommendation, but that's how the world
[SPEAKER_00]: works There's a reason why when you go to
the endo Expo the cannabis cups any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis related event there's a reason
why some people have gigantic fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: boots and lines out the door and You can't
deny success and quality when you see it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm gonna say that if you need some
seeds from seeds here now And you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some coupons check out the ethos seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they call themselves on their
ethos genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to know him as the ethos
collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know him as their names But uh
check out ethos seeds a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have feedback On that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about the people I'm not
talking about any of that stuff when you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the events You will notice that
ethos has a line out the door They've got
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the biggest booths one of the
biggest crowds one of the longest lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can't be a hoax that can't be A
hoax is the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for but I can't be Fuck we're
just gonna say a hoax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody send me the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for It was in my coconut water
the word I'm looking for that can't be a
[SPEAKER_00]: fluke I just had to take a drink and I
found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, is that on camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll move that out of the camera You don't
want that on view the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Check out exotic genetics
top dog genetics Seattle chronic miss Jill
[SPEAKER_00]: and the always controversial ethos
genetics If they won't let you stack up
[SPEAKER_00]: your your discount codes But always always
always go with I read genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the guy, you know the guy that
breeds those seeds something I like is uh
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're buying the seeds, I like
knowing who's behind it like a jinx brew I
[SPEAKER_00]: know jinx.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if jinx is available on seeds
here now is why I didn't say jinx proof
[SPEAKER_00]: But if jinx is on seeds here now by jinx
proof seeds jinx proof is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out jinx he shout out Miss Rose big
shout out to little jinx and the whole the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole jinx II crew down there out there By
jinx proof seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a family You see him raise his
family with the money he makes from his
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, which feels good You know that
you're taking care of jinx II miss Rose
[SPEAKER_00]: and little jinx II who is autistic so
They're buying a lot of iPads and things
[SPEAKER_00]: to help other autistic children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So help out jinx II support jinx proof I'm
not sure if he's available on seeds here
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but that's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always see him at events I always say
what's up always give him a high five So I
[SPEAKER_00]: like knowing the breeders that I'm buying
seeds from we see miss Jill on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media If you've got a question for miss
Jill, you can send her a message on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to her She's an approachable
real person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that in the breeders that I'm
working with that I recommend JJ from top
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at the event Walk up to him say
what's up exotic Mike exotic Mike is at
[SPEAKER_00]: the event He's the big dude with the beard
and the glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't with the sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fucking miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go say what's up He'll talk to you about
his strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the breeders who show their faces
who are out there who are there James loud
[SPEAKER_00]: is out there the people that you could see
their faces Adam Dunn's got his own
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast I respect that if you put your
face out there that just shows you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding behind the internet hiding behind
your logo There are a lot of breeders that
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know who they are some of them We
haven't even heard their real voices like
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when it's transparent that does
a lot for me business-wise It's not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not illegal anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the fucking black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the dark ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the dark web I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should mean a lot to people It means
a lot to me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking high and rambly and we're not
even gonna edit this So let's keep on
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question I want to
do one more before we wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from sticky Randy's garden
And it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it says I'm selecting It's not even
what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says selecting the right plants
for a perpetual grow So this person is
[SPEAKER_00]: asking about selecting the right plants
for a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says right now I'm dealing with the
sassy og Kush fino who is super sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: to light and Forcing me to raise my lights
to keep her from drying out while my other
[SPEAKER_00]: Finos are doing fine under this same
intensity Oh that is frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says in her defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have seen this coming As she grew
thinner leaves and a less filled canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: than my other Finos of the same strain So
there are a couple things to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: right there They want advice on selecting
the correct plants for a perpetual grow
[SPEAKER_00]: because obviously this Sassy og Kush
phenotype is being a little bitch in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've already learned your lesson
But the challenge is have you run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ran these phenotypes before you
doing a phenohunt and that first
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want them small to see what I've
got then you know what you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: then Select plants that run similarly for
your perpetual grow plants that definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the same height plants that grow Kind
of the same structures that way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: plan that if you've got I'm just gonna
hypothetically Guess that you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: five by five and you're doing one plant
here in each corner one here one here one
[SPEAKER_00]: here You got four plants Try to have
plants that grow about the same height
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow the same bushiness that way all
of your plants are the same diameter
[SPEAKER_00]: taking up the same amount of space in your
grow Try to get plants that like the same
[SPEAKER_00]: type of VPD in a in an ideal world We
would lower temperatures later in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can't do that because you've got
other plants in there So you need to find
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are happy with the same VPD
throughout their entire growth cycle That
[SPEAKER_00]: way we can have plants a week one of
flower plants a week three of flower I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure your staggered cycles,
but you get what I'm saying We need plants
[SPEAKER_00]: happy a week one week three week five week
seven and week nine because you got plants
[SPEAKER_00]: of all different stages And there we need
to find the appropriate plants that match
[SPEAKER_00]: up well together I hate to say this
because it sounds like you want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple phenotypes and multiple plants in
there but if you want to run this
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual and maximize it to its full
potential you may want to monocrop which
[SPEAKER_00]: means stick to one strain in that room or
find two strains that work very well
[SPEAKER_00]: together and maybe you've got a Longer one
and a shorter one so you can do one for
[SPEAKER_00]: like 60 days and one for 70 that way you
got a Crop that's ready, and then you got
[SPEAKER_00]: a crop you kind of got a weight on and
then the next one It's ready, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to kind of got a weight on the next
one get your rhythm figured out But you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want plants probably that finish
around the same amount of time plants They
[SPEAKER_00]: want the same amount of VPD through the
entire growth cycle Plants that want the
[SPEAKER_00]: same VPD as each other so that you can get
it right for this plant and this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard trying to dial in the
room for like dosey doe and platinum tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time It's two different
environments, so you're gonna want Plants
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about finding the plants that
work well together you might want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill out on the perpetual and do a phenol
hunt and then find a couple of phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that work well together And then start the
perpetual over once you've got those
[SPEAKER_00]: phenols selected and dialed in Find plants
that grow with similar height shape
[SPEAKER_00]: structure Just similar plants you got to
have plants that work well together in
[SPEAKER_00]: there Unfortunately, I don't know what you
have access to it sounds like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing from seed because it said You
could have seen this coming because other
[SPEAKER_00]: phenols in the room, so you must be
growing from seed So find a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best part about doing
selections You can find things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: vastly different in buzz and flavor and
aroma, but still they grow very similarly
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana prana is gonna stay kind of short
and squat and it's gonna have that That
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie incense sort of a flavor to it if
you put morning dew next to it It would
[SPEAKER_00]: grow very well next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would work very well in a perpetual
together Similar feeds similar VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the buzz and flavor and aroma are
going to be way different So something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that may work for you blue raspberry
truffle and strawberry starburst They grow
[SPEAKER_00]: similarly but their buzz and their flavor
are so different that that would work well
[SPEAKER_00]: for you So those would also work well if
you want to run one big room together Do
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue raspberry truffle and strawberry
starburst together?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to do that perpetual
you're gonna have to find strains that all
[SPEAKER_00]: work on the schedule on the cycle Don't go
into this Starting perpetually keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that there are steps You've got to
find your phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dial in your phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn every detail of that
girl This is like having multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriends in one room Which is going to
be a challenge because one girl probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to listen to this kind of music and
the other girl wants to listen to this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of music so you got to find the music
right in the middle for both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: girls or you got to find two girls that
both want to listen to fish and reggae all
[SPEAKER_00]: day long and they got to be careful and
Okay with being in the same room together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where your challenge is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to find the plants that are
perfect for your room So don't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: the first don't think you're gonna pop
seeds and start a perpetual grow pop seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: find phenotypes Select two phenotypes dial
in those phenotypes then with the dialed
[SPEAKER_00]: in information start the perpetual there I
feel like we jump in with big plans big
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas a little bit too early Sometimes
when it comes to cannabis growing so have
[SPEAKER_00]: a goal have a strategy select your
