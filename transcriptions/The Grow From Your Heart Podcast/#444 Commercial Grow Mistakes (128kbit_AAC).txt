[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Show Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is time for Episode 444 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, I've been taking dabs of pre-98
Bubba Kush batter and I'm dunking that
[SPEAKER_03]: batter in the GG4 Terps and I'm also
sticking GG4 Diamonds into that mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's read these potency labels a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pre-98 Bubba Kush batter, the potency
label says this product contains 61% THC
[SPEAKER_03]: and 72.2% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The GG4 is listed at 68.8% THC and 79.1%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes for a wonderful combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: The batter really punches you in the
lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That pre-98 Bubba Kush is a little indica
heavy so it makes you a little lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It relaxes you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get that head punch and that
brain spin from the GG4.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a really delicious, really potent
combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really puts me in a great mood for
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a giant shout out to our friends from
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you noticed I've got some music
in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't usually play music on the show,
usually because that causes problems on
[SPEAKER_03]: the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today, I was in the mood to groove a
little bit so we've got some music in the
[SPEAKER_03]: background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to my friends in the Mystic
Roots band for letting me use their music
[SPEAKER_03]: on my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long time since we've heard
from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to talk about more common grow
[SPEAKER_03]: room mistakes but I'm going to talk about
things that I've seen in commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities and I will talk about things
that I've seen in small private grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we get there, let's do some
shout outs to a few of my friends on
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to start off with a big giant Grow
From Your Heart podcast shout out to Ms.

[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like we're coming to the end of
that instrumental track there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did mention that we are going to talk
about some common grow room mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to remind you that the DGC 710
concentration celebration is coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be 713 at Cultivated Synergy in

[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see your smile and face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to give you a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be all set up at Cultivated

[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have my new booth set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am excited to share that with the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have some iRegenetics t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have a whole bunch of brand new
iRegenetics gear available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have the always lovely,
always beautiful dab and granny hanging
[SPEAKER_03]: out at my booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a possibility of an appearance
from our friend, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the always beautiful Miss
Amy will be at the booth with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So drop by.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Concentration celebration on 713 at
Cultivated Synergy in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop by the iRegenetics booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The booth will be very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good segue.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a funny thing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met somebody recently and they said,
holy shit, dude, your voice and your
[SPEAKER_03]: appearance do not match one bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a podcast listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been listening for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if they want their name said
on the show, but they were surprised at my
[SPEAKER_03]: appearance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't often speak of the way I look on
the show because that's not what this show
[SPEAKER_03]: is about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you come see me at the dude grows
concentration celebration, don't be
[SPEAKER_03]: intimidated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about six foot five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm fucking tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing most people say when they
meet me is, holy shit, you're tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing they say is, holy shit,
your dreadlocks are long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm a six foot five tall white guy
with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: To my knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really easy to recognize and
identify.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also fucking obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also really friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So come introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a pretty kind dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And come visit the booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want everybody to be friends with Irene
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen to the show, if you support
us in any way, come say hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be intimidated.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I thought it was funny when this
person said, holy shit, your voice and
[SPEAKER_03]: your appearance do not match one bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really thought that was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody stated that I sound very
corporate and I look very not corporate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's a compliment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that I sound professional and I
sound educated and I speak well and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not a dipshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a compliment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I look very not corporate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also a compliment to trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two more quick things to cover
before we get to the main topic of the
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next one is the 710 drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: On 710, a whole bunch of brand new
feminized seeds will drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check out SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check out Oregon Elite
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also make sure you check out DankSeed
.store for fresh drops of Irene genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, my last order of business before we
get to the main topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you would like news and updates on
fresh Irene genetics drops, if there are
[SPEAKER_03]: new strains coming out, if there are sales
happening, if there are coupon codes
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, if there are promotions
happening through social media or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, or if there is an
event such as the Dude Grows Cup or
[SPEAKER_03]: another event where I may randomly choose
to pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you join my mailing list, I will keep
you updated on all of those types of
[SPEAKER_03]: happenings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So send an email to iregeneticsmailinglist
at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll add you to the mailing list.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep you updated on seed drops,
on sales, on promotions, on live events,
[SPEAKER_03]: on contests and giveaways and any other
random things that I think you may benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: from getting a heads up on.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that covers all of the business
for the intro of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into the main topic of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said it a couple of times that I want
to talk about things that I've observed in
[SPEAKER_03]: grow rooms that I find to be easily
correctable common mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in case you're new to the show,
let me build some credibility before I go
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about my commercial grow room
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been in the commercial grow
industry since 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been in the Colorado medical
cannabis industry since 2007.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been growing commercial cannabis for
over 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in many large facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in many small facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ran facilities that average about 100
lamps, but I have ran facilities that have
[SPEAKER_03]: over five, sometimes 700 lamps in one
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have held many positions in the legal
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of experience on the retail
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a lot of stuff in that side.
[SPEAKER_03]: My main focus is the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have worked as a grow tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have worked as a grow leader.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have worked as a lead grower for the
entire facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked as a cultivation director.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now at this time, I'm working as a
commercial cultivation contracted
[SPEAKER_03]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my main goal is to increase
productivity in your commercial facility
[SPEAKER_03]: by 20 to 30% in a very short time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm
simply going to increase harvest weights.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of things to be looked at
when it comes to increasing productivity
[SPEAKER_03]: and overall profits in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, your first goal is to get the grow up
to speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to set and reach production and
potency goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there are other ways we can find to
save money in a commercial production
[SPEAKER_03]: facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do things a little more efficiently
that will save us manpower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do things more effectively that
will make us order and waste less product
[SPEAKER_03]: and materials?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are always ways to increase
productivity and increase overall profits
[SPEAKER_03]: in a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I mainly do is I'm hired to go into a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll walk around that facility and take a
good tour, look at all of the equipment,
[SPEAKER_03]: write some notes, ask about all of the
HVAC, ask about a few of their systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I like to observe the employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch everybody work for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learn everybody's role.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what everybody does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see strengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after a couple of days, I meet with
management and I explain what is going on
[SPEAKER_03]: and where we can improve things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's up to management to take my
advice and actually implement my
[SPEAKER_03]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we move from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been doing this for several years
in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am branching out to New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have branched out to Oklahoma and I have
got a large reach in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should give me a little bit of
credibility for why I feel like I should
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to talk about commercial
cultivation and why I feel like I am able
[SPEAKER_03]: to identify and point out common mistakes
that I see in grow environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that I have got a little bit of
street cred, a little bit of commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: grow credibility, let's talk about some of
the mistakes I see in way too many
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first things I notice when I
walk into a commercial facility is that
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the places are a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the grow facilities are
disorganized and messy and that will lead
[SPEAKER_03]: to big problems down the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of facilities with messy
floors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of leaves on the floor like
they just defoliated and threw that shit
[SPEAKER_03]: on the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of tables that are clogged up
with leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that dead decaying leaf is not a
good thing for your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, all of that leaf matter is a
potentially sweet spot for a bug like a
spider.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider mite or a thrip or something else
just to hang out and breed and throw a
[SPEAKER_03]: party and create large populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you even know it, they move right
up to your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a huge spider mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first mistake is just generally
messy grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean up all those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean up all that extra shit that's in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need leaves on the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that takes is a broom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sweep a large grow room in just
very few minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get done with whatever job you're
doing, you've got a couple of extra
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes before lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just dick around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lean against the wall and hope nobody
notices that you're not doing shit for
[SPEAKER_03]: five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take some initiative and just go sweep up
one of those piles that are in a grow
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will help you out in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will help you prevent bug problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is going to make the grow look
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being in a grow that looks better will
increase morale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will make people care more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So overall, it will increase the
performance of your team and make the grow
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So clean up all the crap on the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean up all of the stuff on the tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need old rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need spray bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need measuring containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need random shit in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those things have a home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put them in their home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them belong in the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make some effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take out the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now another thing that goes along with the
generally messy grow environment is a
[SPEAKER_03]: disorganized work area.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're one of those chaotic,
messy growers that has shit everywhere in
[SPEAKER_03]: your work area, you've got a measuring cup
over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a cup over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a bottle over here that's open.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got another bottle over here open.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've written a half a note about what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your phone's open playing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not paying attention to shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're one of those chaotic guys that's
got your scissors over in that room,
[SPEAKER_03]: your notebook's on that table,
your pH pen is way over there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can speed up your day and become way
more productive by simply organizing and
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaning up your workspace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not having to look for shit every time you
need it will save you countless minutes,
[SPEAKER_03]: which will add up to countless hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my consulting clients get really
surprised that one of the first requests I
[SPEAKER_03]: make of their staff is to take half a day
to just clean the entire facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are all the plants alive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they last through the end of the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: If the plants are cool, we're gonna put
them on hold for the day and we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to clean the entire facility from top to
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We start off by cleaning every single grow
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get all the trash, all of the debris,
all of the unnecessary shit comes out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we clean up the entire facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we clean the work area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we clean up the storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make designated spaces for all of the
gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, the next time when you're
working and you spill something and
[SPEAKER_03]: another guy wants to go get the mop,
he doesn't have to run to four different
[SPEAKER_03]: places to see where you left the mop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is over there in the fucking mop spot
where it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will save you so much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The scissors, you need scissors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're over there where the scissors
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will save you so much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first things that I do is I ask
the staff to clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like taking over a new kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I took over a kitchen, I would make the
staff take a day to clean that kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I do help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tie up the dreadlocks, put on some gloves,
put on a shitty grubby t-shirt and get in
[SPEAKER_03]: there and help those boys clean the shit
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is part of my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not gonna do shit that they don't
see me do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to keep the team moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a little rowdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a little silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: But stay motivated, stay passionate and
make sure that your grow space is clean
[SPEAKER_03]: and organized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody and every grow space has that
one chore that everybody has been
[SPEAKER_03]: avoiding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now is the time to do that stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take a minute, go clean it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll feel so much better when it's
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll feel better just by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of stress will be relieved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when management comes, they saw that
mess the last couple of times they were
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They saw that little corner where you're
just throwing all this shit and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: making a big mess and it's all nasty
looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Management sees that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't said anything about it yet,
but they're taking a note and they saw it
[SPEAKER_03]: last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They saw it the time before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that shit's there the third time,
that's when they'll say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's up to you to take initiative and
clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes for everything in your grow,
organize your space, get it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna save you a lot of time and
you'll be more productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've been going on about that for
long enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another common mistake I see is very poor
planning and communication.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, hey, how many days into flower is
room A?
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the grow techs go, oh,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to ask, go ask Jeff,
he knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody should know how far into flower
you are because it should be written on a
[SPEAKER_03]: calendar somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either at the little main mixing area
at the central location or you've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: calendar on the outside of each grow room
that says, we put this room into flower on
[SPEAKER_03]: this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: This grow room is going to need these
things this week, these things this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a calendar, make a chart,
have a plan, write some shit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at a grow recently and I said,
hey, when did you put these into flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they kind of look like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody said, oh, two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was about 22 days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody had any idea when those plants went
into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what to feed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know when to harvest them because
nobody wrote any shit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell by looking when they will be
ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be more ideal if we could know when
they fucking went into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Write that shit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really easy just to say on January
1st, I put room A into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Write that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then everybody in the facility knows on
January 1st, room A went into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So communicate with each other,
have some notes, have some sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: communication hub.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not on an application in your
phone, use a pen and paper, write notes at
[SPEAKER_03]: a central location or everybody that works
in that facility needs to check on that
[SPEAKER_03]: the first thing in the morning when they
get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to have a giant dry erase board.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that dry erase board, I will make a
plan for the day and a plan for the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the time I will have a solid
plan for the entire flowering phase of
[SPEAKER_03]: each flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go into that flowering room that is
all visible for all employees to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way we all know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when we start a shift, everybody
walks to that board and they look at it
[SPEAKER_03]: and they say, oh, today, we need to
defoliate room A, we need to apply a
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticide application to the veg room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to make sure to do this and
whatever else to room C.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a solid list written out on
the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what to do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also learn what tasks specific
employees are very good at and which task
[SPEAKER_03]: specific employees do not like to do,
and I will do my best to assign tasks to
[SPEAKER_03]: the correct employee.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got a guy who is six foot five,
you might want him putting up trellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got a guy who's five foot two,
you might want him taking the bottoms off
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn to utilize people's skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of grow facilities with no
plan, no rhyme or reason, no fucking goal,
[SPEAKER_03]: no communication, and it's not going to
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a team.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are all there with the same goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have the same map so you can
all reach the same destination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get a plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some communication going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a spot in your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's just you, you can do all this
stuff also.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need some notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're running a large facility,
get your team together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get everybody on the same page.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get everybody in line for the same goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let everybody know where you're going to
turn left, where you're going to turn
[SPEAKER_03]: right, and you can all get there together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, you can all get a bonus at the
end of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are some simple things we can all
work on to improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: To correct some mistakes in the grow,
let's work on more actual physical things
[SPEAKER_03]: that I see people doing wrong in a grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a lot of facilities, I see plants
pressed too tightly together.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are just trying to crush
plants together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have room to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have room for proper
transpiration and respiration,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're struggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of growing out and branching and
getting strong and robust, your plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: growing straight up because they're angry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're too snuggled in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to be touching each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if I put you on the bus or on the
subway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where you're from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I put you in a restaurant that's got
way too many damn people in it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is super crowded.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you can spread your arms out,
you're comfortable about life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people get close to you where you got
to keep your arms in, you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I can't spread my arms out.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as people start rubbing you elbow
to elbow or shoulder to shoulder,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get like, who the fuck are all these
people and where they come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to be able to reach out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if they kind of rustle the leaves of
the other ones, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't want to be resting on each
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never want two leaves laying on top of
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to create a problem between
those two leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really want plants rubbing up
against each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them some space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I see this in veg rooms and I see
this in flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give the plants some breathing room.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will give us a few advantages.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, you're going to get breathing
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants will grow more productively.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be able to transpire and respire
more appropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, by spreading out the plants,
we can get them more wind from our fans,
[SPEAKER_03]: which will make them a little stronger and
a little more robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, by spreading out our plants,
we can apply pesticide applications more
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the plants are all crushed together and
crowded in, how are you going to coat
[SPEAKER_03]: every surface of that plant with a
pesticide applicator if there are leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: touching, if you've got too much shit
pressed together?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is much easier to appropriately and
properly apply a pesticide to plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: are not completely crowded in.
[SPEAKER_03]: By spreading our plants out a little bit,
we are also going to improve our overall
[SPEAKER_03]: VPD throughout the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: When our plants are too close together,
we do create microclimates.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are little pockets of humidity,
little pockets of heat, little pockets of
[SPEAKER_03]: dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got random different microclimates
throughout the grow environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is not what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: By moving the plants apart a little bit,
we allow for more airflow, which allows
[SPEAKER_03]: for a more appropriate VPD, which
eliminates the opportunity for a
[SPEAKER_03]: microclimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another thing that I often see is
that people let their plants grow way too
[SPEAKER_03]: close to the big commercial-grade grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you allow your plants to grow too
closely to those high-powered grow lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: you will burn the tips of your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will bleach the tips of your buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will start burning the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those plants will slow in growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the leaves will start curling up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will piss off those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main mistake that causes this problem
is poor plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are planning, somebody did not make
an appropriate grow room schedule,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants were allowed to veg for too
long, they got too tall before they were
[SPEAKER_03]: flipped into flower, and now you are
dealing with plants that are way too tall
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are trying to grow into the
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you just going to let them grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to try to trellis them down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to bend them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to pop them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they just going to grow into the
lights and get too tall?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got like four or five weeks left to
go to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit sucks to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you know how tall your plants
are going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do your best to flower those plants
before they grow up into the grow lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now on the opposite side of that too close
together coin, we have got the growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep their plants way too far apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a commercial grow environment,
every inch of grow space is valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all valuable real estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to find the very fine line,
that perfect balance between not crushing
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants together, but also not having
them so far apart that you're wasting
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not trying to grow floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not trying to grow table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need the light shining down on
our hydro table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need the light shining down onto
the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want all of our light hitting leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do need to find that balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: How close together do we put them?
[SPEAKER_03]: How far apart do we put them?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want them to maybe rustle against each
other, but we don't want them resting on
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a commercial grow environment,
space is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every inch of grow space is valuable real
estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a long row of plants and
you've got too much space between those
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, do you think you could possibly
move each plant down one to two inches
[SPEAKER_03]: closer together and maybe fit one more
plant at the end of that row so that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can get one more plant worth of
productivity?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an option?
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a fine line between squeezing
those plants in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will just slow you down or you can
add that extra plant to properly fill all
[SPEAKER_03]: of your space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't squeeze them in too closely and
also don't leave a lot of empty space.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your lights are shining down between
your plants and you put your hand down at
[SPEAKER_03]: the bottom of the canopy near the pots,
if you get light hitting your hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants are too far apart or your
canopy is too sparse.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to fill in that space.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times this happens when a new
grower is trying to run a trellis system
[SPEAKER_03]: for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand how to properly
spread those plants out and fill in that
[SPEAKER_03]: trellis to get that big fat canopy going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're packing in a room,
if you're about to put up a trellis and
[SPEAKER_03]: try to get all those branches in that
trellis, think about filling that space
[SPEAKER_03]: the best you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the light coming from above.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to see any light on the
table or the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want all of that light to be gathered
by leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, we need to defoliate
enough to where we don't block all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: light to where the lower of the plant
can't get enough light to be active.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a fine line, a fine balance
defined in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to keep the plants close together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to keep them far enough apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to keep enough light shining deep
enough into the canopy, but we don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: it hitting our table or our floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do need to find that balance when
spacing your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ever think that a plant is in a
permanent position until you have worked
[SPEAKER_03]: it into a trellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that plant doesn't have a net around it
or some of the sticks aren't going through
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of a net that are attaching it
to another plant, that plant is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: mobile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid to start off with the
plants kind of close together.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they grow, spread them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they continue to grow, spread them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see them touching, if you see them
getting too crowded in, it's time to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of do a little bit of pruning,
maybe manicure out some of the messy
[SPEAKER_03]: parts, but then you need to spread them
out so they can grow out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to go straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're only doing that because you've got
them too close together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another super common mistake that I
see made in commercial grow environments
[SPEAKER_03]: and in personal grows is a lack of bud
supports.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't want to use sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't use tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't use trellising.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to wait until the very last
minute when that fucking branch is
[SPEAKER_03]: flopping over and ready to break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there and put some sticks in your
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there and put a tomato cage around
your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use some zip ties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use a twist tie or use a garden tie is
what they call them, and tie those big
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy branches to your tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tie those big heavy branches to some sort
of a support stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it before everything starts falling
over and making a giant mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so much easier to get in that grow
space and adjust the sticks and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: giant buds around week three or four than
it is to do it around week five and six
[SPEAKER_03]: when they've already gotten giant and
sticky and they're starting to topple
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there and do that shit early.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally, in a commercial environment,
you would set up long rows and you would
[SPEAKER_03]: just set up a trellis system so you don't
have to put a thousand stakes in all of
[SPEAKER_03]: your pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is much easier to run a trellis system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get some sort of supports in your
plants early.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't wait until they're falling over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes much more manpower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes much more effort, and you're
probably fucking up a bunch of buds trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to lift them back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get some supports in your plants early
is another thing people seem to miss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I would highly suggest getting your
plants off the floor if that is an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most grow facilities and basements and
wherever most people are growing quite
[SPEAKER_03]: often have concrete floors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the floors are treated with
something in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: but still that concrete floor is going to
get very cold during your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The concrete stays cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in Colorado, it gets fucking cold in
the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have negative temperatures in the
middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have snow stacked up three feet
outside of our facility indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be okay warm because of the grow
lights and all the equipment, but that
[SPEAKER_03]: floor gets really cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if you got out of bed first thing
in the morning, you don't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: slippers, you don't have any socks,
and I just push your cold ass feet right
[SPEAKER_03]: onto that outside cold concrete.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what your plants are sleeping on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what your plants are living on
constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got them on a cold floor,
then you're going to water them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they are on that cold ass floor filled
with water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like dipping your toes or your nuts
in Arctic freeze water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them up off the ground if that is an
option.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand some of you have to work with
what you've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can just get them off the ground,
put it on a cinder block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite commonly, I see people take another
pot, flip it upside down, put the pot
[SPEAKER_03]: right on top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just off up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we are trying to do is create space
between that cold floor and our plants so
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can get our balls and our feet up
off that freezing cold floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will really make the plants more
productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make nutrient uptake happen more
easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will make pH fluctuations stop,
and it will overall improve the quality
[SPEAKER_03]: and harvest weight of your finished
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get your plants up off the floor and
you will see improvements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've got one last note to talk about
common mistakes that I see in a commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: grow room environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to save this for a complete
episode, but I think I can cover it here
[SPEAKER_03]: in a quick rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I see people making huge
mistakes with in a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_03]: environment is what I call the basement
grower mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many people have gotten into the
commercial cannabis game thinking that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can take the ideas and technology
that they have learned in their basement
[SPEAKER_03]: and just multiply it and it will work on a
commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory, most of your math should work,
but it is not that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many more things to think
about when it comes to commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you work in a commercial
cultivation environment, it is time to
[SPEAKER_03]: shift from a basement grower, from a hobby
grower, from a home grower mindset,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you need to focus on being a
commercial scale cannabis cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't care if that's medical or
recreational, you need to shift gears.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be an efficient and effective
commercial grower, you must shift your
[SPEAKER_03]: brain to think in a commercial
productivity type of a mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: The home grower basement will not survive
in the commercial world.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you are working in a commercial
cultivation facility, every dollar,
[SPEAKER_03]: every hour, every minute counts,
everything matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot more freedom and a lot more
leeway in our personal productivity grows,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you need to lose those habits when you
come to a commercial cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a semi-large facility recently
with an obviously new owner and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: asking him some of his plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: He told me where he was going and then he
said, eventually I want to pop a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: these seeds and maybe find a few
phenotypes out of this and run that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, why do you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, oh, I don't know,
just to add something new or play around
[SPEAKER_03]: with some seeds and see what we can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to stop him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to say, sir, you just said,
play around and see what we can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point in time, you are in debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just took over a commercial facility
that is in the red and you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about playing around with a phenol hunt to
see what you can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: When this new owner took over this
facility, it was already loaded with elite
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: This facility has all of the genetics it
needs and this guy is already thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about popping new seeds to start a phenol
hunt in one of his flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not productive for a business that
is already in the red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of running that grow room full of
seedlings that we don't know what they are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do, that man needs to find his
highest producing cultivar, his best
[SPEAKER_03]: selling cultivar and pack that entire room
with that plant and produce as much of
[SPEAKER_03]: that as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that he can get his business out of the
red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I kind of had to grab him and say,
bro, you're thinking like a basement
[SPEAKER_03]: grower quit doing that stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's focus our mind on a commercial
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually he snapped out of it and
he's not going to do a silly phenol hunt,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I had to almost slap this man to get
him to think straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So focus your mind more appropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your eye on the prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eliminate any bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take out anything in your process that
slows you down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take out anything you're doing that is
just novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take out anything that you do because your
uncle Larry said that it was a good idea
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless all of those weird tricks that
you're doing actually show some sort of a
[SPEAKER_03]: visible payoff, cut that useless,
habitual, silly shit out of your routine
[SPEAKER_03]: and focus on being a top notch advanced
commercial cannabis cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, podcast world, my voice is
starting to get super dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have more things to talk about when
it comes to making mistakes in a grow
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing to do when it comes to
making a mistake in the grow room is to
[SPEAKER_03]: acknowledge that you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid to admit it and then learn
from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn how to not make that mistake again
and learn how to move forward and correct
[SPEAKER_03]: your mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how you become the best grower and
the best person that you can possibly be.

Bontan.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a new style and fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings I bring to you, my children.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings I bring to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings I bring to you, my sweet
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings I bring to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Count your blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Count them one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give all the thanks and praise to Jeff
for all that he has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Count your blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Count them two by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do unto others as you'd have them do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to you, I count my blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with Georgia by my side,
there is no stressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No if, but maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reap what we sow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we keep on progressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No regressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you think you got it bad,
somebody got it bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling sad and low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, somebody feeling sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to give unto your sister and
your brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're never at the bottom of the
ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why me give thanks for this
universal university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me give thanks for my health, strength,
and sanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me give thanks for my friends,
also my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know me jamming with the M.A.B
fraternity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel blessed.

Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings I bring to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting in the past all of my stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not hurting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm working with the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: God put me to a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And said he'd lend a hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And told me he would mow me to an
independent man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm looking at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a little more better.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom ain't losing a dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just won't let her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to spread a message of positivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an opportunity is what you're giving
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to spread my love from the
sea now to the babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect for my brethren.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smiles for the ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look, but you can't touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I might hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking clean in them rockaway jeans and
