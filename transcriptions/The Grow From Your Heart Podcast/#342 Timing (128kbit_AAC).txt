[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, roll up a fat spliff,
[SPEAKER_00]: pack up a bong load or start heating up
that dab nail because it's time for a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, internet world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 342 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get too far, let me give a shout
out to Martin Land for that great backing
[SPEAKER_00]: track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to the wonderful intro music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm recording this podcast on
late in the evening on August 8th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past few days have not been as
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the outdoor growers are working for
their money this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got outdoor plants in Southern
Colorado, you were working your ass off
[SPEAKER_00]: the past couple of days because it has
been raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been hailing like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golf ball sized hail was not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the grapefruit sized hail that was
damaging things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a zoo in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the shit beat out of that zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals died.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were taken to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been crazy weather wise here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing outdoors this year,
much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were working your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it goes well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're facing a wildfire and your
cannabis grow, good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got to be some scary shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it all goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody stays safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't have a cannabis grow,
I hope things go well for you with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the wildfires in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I'm recording late in the
evening on August 8th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will not come out until August 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little vacation coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get prepared so I don't miss
an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this show on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today and this evening, I've been taking
dabs of Fatso Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination of GMO and Legend
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as dark roast
coffee, garlic, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely got all three of those
flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inhale, you get the dark roast
coffee, maybe a little yerba mate flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of sweetness on the inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as you exhale it, that's where the
fuel came in for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the smoke went across my tongue and
across my lips on the exhale, that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up that fuel flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as it sat there for a moment,
I exhaled, I closed my mouth, I licked my
[SPEAKER_00]: lips, I took a breath, and that's when the
garlic flavor kicked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had garlic breath from this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's warm, it's savory, and the high from
it is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's settled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like comfort food on a comfort high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that garlicky comfort food
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's savory and real nice, and it tastes
like it would be warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was food, it would be like warm
garlic mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it settles in with this nice body
warming high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like wearing a sweater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and chilling on my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me nice and mellowed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice, and it's honestly way
different than what I normally would
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I want something that's going to
make my brain skyrocket, spin around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make me forget where I put my keys and
lose my sunglasses while they're on my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this Fatso Nectar has just got me
chilling, and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm smoking on the Fatso Nectar from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to share what I'm smoking with
the audience so you guys know why I sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm only at half speed for the first
10 minutes of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of episodes ago, I spoke for far
too long about insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a little less time than
I spent on insert dabs to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: something else I was sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends at Happy Daddy sent me a very
nice care package.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me an insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a couple of great dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sent me some Terp spinners,
also known as Terp pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them labeled as different things
in different markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are tiny glass balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the size of a pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the perfect size of a pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is somewhere between seven
and nine millimeters is the size of this
[SPEAKER_00]: little ball here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is you put one or two,
or you could put more if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put two inside the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fairly deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what a banger is,
I won't go too far into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a glass thimble that
attaches to your rig, which is a small
[SPEAKER_00]: bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use a big rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a small rig, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many reasons why a small rig is
better than a big rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to smoke a gallon of
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a liter of air into your
lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get a fucking dab to your
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and a bong, you fill it up with all
that smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke and smoke and smoke,
and then once that chamber is filled,
[SPEAKER_00]: you pull it and then you get all that
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to do that with a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to press that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that dab against the nail,
and you want that smoke to go to your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm ranting, since I'm going off
on a side right here, when you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: the carb cap on, quit taking it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lift it off for a second
to carb the dab so that you can get all
[SPEAKER_00]: that smoke out of the rig, and then you
can take a fresh pull when you go back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But leave the carb cap on there when
you're dabbing, because every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: take it off, you're letting heat out,
and it's changing the temperature of that
[SPEAKER_00]: oil that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so frustrating to see everyone on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put the carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give it a swirl, and they take the
carb cap off and exhale their dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get their brain together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they put the cap on and go back for
another pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would have left that cap on there,
it would have been more beneficial for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, in my opinion and in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: This banger, it's called a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dab nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attaches to my rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a thimble-like piece of glass on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heat that thimble-like piece of
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I drop my glass ball in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you heard that on the mic
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a little couple of glass balls
inside of the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I heat the banger where the wall and
the floor meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heat at an angle right at that corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to heat that corner up right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I move around the base of the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want most of my heat down there on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my dab is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base of my new banger from Happy Daddy
and Black Market Glass, the base is fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: thick, so I gotta heat it for kind of a
little bit and then let it cool just to
[SPEAKER_00]: the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those balls that I've got in there are
also heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to help maintain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I can scoop up a gigantic dab,
and I can drop that dab in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as soon as the oil hits the nail,
science says that it starts cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That combination, it starts getting
cooler, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put a real big dab in there,
you gotta start smoking it quickly because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're losing all of your temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you throw a carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps you stoke that heat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you vaporize your dab at a lower
temperature because it creates a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less air pressure coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's heat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes less heat to cook your dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I got this glass ball in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in there when I heated the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also got heat in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put the carb cap on there,
it takes a specific carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: A non-directional carb cap is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a carb cap that points straight
down and has semi-decent airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put the carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start smoking, these turp
spinners, they start doing a little dance
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you suck just right, and I'm not
going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you inhale just right, if you pull it
just the right speed, you'll get those
[SPEAKER_00]: little beads in there to spin around
inside your nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll lift up and start spinning inside
there like they're a little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when your dab is done, you grab a
Q-tip and you clean out the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to get those little
balls out there and kind of clean them off
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get just a paper towel and some
isopropyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the Q-tip and clean it out the best
I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it cools, I just take the
banger right off the rig, dump the little
[SPEAKER_00]: balls into the ISO soaked paper towel and
just rub them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rub your balls down and get them nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just drop them right back into
the banger and they're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way it helps spin my dab
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put the dab directly onto the hot
glass, it likes to singe if you have it
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just scorch it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a liquid is going to do when
it hits glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to boil basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put the turp spinners in there
and it's moving the oil around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can let it go a little cooler on the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because you don't have to go in,
let's see how I can say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's going to retain heat longer,
I can let it cool a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can go in a little cooler and I know
that those little hot balls in there are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to spin around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to keep my dab cooking
because they've retained heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're also going to splash that oil
around on the nail to where it doesn't sit
[SPEAKER_00]: in a hot spot and scorch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got, that's like flipping the
veggies in the frying pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cooking my oil slowly and I'm
getting a more of a vaporized hit instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of a burnt hit and I'm getting a lot more
turps out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to compare the,
I said that it wasn't going to be as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as the insert dab talk, but I probably
fucked that up already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of compare the insert
dab to the spinners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spinners are fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spinners are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun for your friends to go,
Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it's been in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really didn't do too much improvement on
my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just said that I was able to cook
it at a lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could really do that way better with the
insert dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insert dab crushes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in the mood for a giant dab and I
really want to take a chunky dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: the insert dab is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the little, the smaller thimble and
I load that sucker up and then I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I can heat the shit out of that nail and I
haven't really overheated to do an insert
[SPEAKER_00]: dab yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten that scorched flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really fried my lungs yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like the insert dab is the way to
go and the turps and the high are
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous from the insert dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the turp spinners are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the appropriate carb cap to make
it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the right carb cap,
you're going to just suck so hard and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be like, they don't move
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little balls are just going to sit
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got the appropriate carb cap
and the appropriate nail and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressure right, they will spin around
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of times I got burned out on it
and I hit the insert more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you guys, I find myself hitting
my basic thermal banger more than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it timed out to where I know
exactly how long to heat it, how long to
[SPEAKER_00]: let it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know just how big of a dab that amount
of heat can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when to throw that dab in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know to get the carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how hard I can pull to get the air
through the carb cap and still not get
[SPEAKER_00]: water into my mouth if I suck on that rig
too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself hitting the thermal banger
more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turp spinners, they're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't make a whole lot of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insert is cool, but you got to let it
cool after you hit it and then you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that insert out and then you got to
clean that and then you got to load up
[SPEAKER_00]: another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun and it's a cool process if you're
dabbing by yourself and you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy sitting across the table going,
so can I get a dab also, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I just watched you take one and
you've been cleaning shit for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: four minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insert dabs are cool for if there's one or
two of you hanging out and Mike's patient
[SPEAKER_00]: and not in a hurry for a dab, but if
you're dabbing with three or four people
[SPEAKER_00]: and you got to get the rig around the room
and everybody wants to get stoned,
[SPEAKER_00]: a normal banger-style nail is probably the
better way to go for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of people,
you might want to bust out a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to get an e-nail set up,
but if we're going to compare the turp
[SPEAKER_00]: spinners to the insert, I would prefer the
insert all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, the insert is too much
maintenance for a group or on the go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I tried to keep that short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that was short enough for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, a big shout out to my friends
at Happy Daddy for the wonderful care
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move this podcast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a comment that I got
from a grower friend and it goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the most entertaining cannabis
podcast by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, first off, thanks for enjoying my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the great compliment and
thanks for this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the question says, it's my first time
making seeds and my plants are on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this be an issue that the females are
getting pollen later in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: period?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is how nature intended it,
but I've read they need pollen earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy's got an outdoor crop that he
intends on making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a male out there and probably
multiple females.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to flower them out using the
natural cycle of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that male is going to dump pollen on
his girls and he's going to have seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: His concern is that the male and female
aren't going to time up because when a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of breeders talk about timing and
pollination in an indoor environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd like to get the male a little bit
ahead of the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to put him in the room and get his
pollen started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we keep him separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get the girls in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each girl, each female plant likes to
be pollinated at a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lemon skunk plant, you've got to wait a
little later in the flowering phase to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate her than the platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum tangy wants pollen really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon skunk wants pollen really late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would put the lemon skunk in the room
seven to 10 days before the platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw that platinum tangy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them both caught up to where they're
both at their prime time for pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've already got that boy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been dumping pollen for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in this peak pollination time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of pollen just falling off
of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I would go drag him across the
room and shake the shit out of him and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of his pollen would go over those girls,
which are both at their peak ovulation
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, it's a little more critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got the right idea when you
said, I know this is how nature intended
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I've read that they need pollen
earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your boy plant is going to be dumping
pollen outside in plenty of time for your
[SPEAKER_00]: girls to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, that boy is going to start
dumping pollen a little bit too early and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to want to get the pollen
on those girls, like I said, until that
[SPEAKER_00]: peak ovulation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your male plant is going to start putting
out pollen early in the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, it would be around day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, it's hard to predict because I
don't know what strain you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was indoors and brought
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in a pot and it's
root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know its conditions, but that
plant's going to start dropping pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: around maybe 12 days, 14 days,
17 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those girls aren't going to be ready for
pollen until about day 23, 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 27 for some of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon skunk doesn't want pollen until
closer to day 32, the lemon skunk that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what girls or males you
have got in there, or out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any idea what genetics you're
working with and I don't know their
[SPEAKER_00]: condition when you put them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how soon your boy is going to
start dropping pollen, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be somewhere around between day 12
and 14 or 17, the pollen will start coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, those girls aren't ready by
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick would be keeping the pollen off
of those girls until they're nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start looking like dandelions,
when they're coated and you guys call them
[SPEAKER_00]: the white hairs, those hairs are what
receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hairs are pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pistols catch the pollen or the
pollen lands on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slides down that pistol and it goes
into the ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ovule starts producing a seed and
fills that calic spot up with the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is the more of those fluffy
hairs, those pistols you have available,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more seed production you can get off
of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a perfect world, we would time up our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would keep the male way over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would keep the girl way over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would keep the other girl way over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was time, we would bring them all
into the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd match them all up and we would do the
deed, but we can't do that outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature is going to make it happen just
like it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have been surviving and
reproducing on their own for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the trick there is that those were
probably land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same male and same girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pollinating each other and
dropping seeds and it was just different F
[SPEAKER_00]: generations every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your plants are not in the perfect
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in an indoor environment where
you can time everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to make plenty of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much pollen to make a lot
of seed, especially in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the plants want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just trying to make seeds for
yourself, you're going to be overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be amazed with how many
seeds you produce in one small seed run
[SPEAKER_00]: from some outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short version of my answer is just let
it happen naturally and everything will be
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep that pollen, if you can
keep that male plant from being disturbed
[SPEAKER_00]: too much, try that, but it's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind, animals, bugs, all kinds of shit is
going to disrupt your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it happen naturally and everything
should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will recommend when I am
making seeds, when I am purposefully
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding a crop, I increase the amount of
amino acids I feed my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want more aminos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already adding an amino
product, you may want to consider adding
[SPEAKER_00]: something with amino acids to your lineup
right at the beginning of flowering and
[SPEAKER_00]: through the seed production phase of your
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said this is your first attempt at
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to give some breeding advice
and guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those seeds are done, keep them all
separated so that you know what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, hopefully you're that far ahead
of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know to keep plant A with seed A and
plant B with seeds B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got a plant labeled or a jar
labeled seeds from plant A and a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled and you've got the cross written
down and you know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it is your job to grow those seeds
out yourself before they go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you or somebody that you know and
trust and they have been told these are
[SPEAKER_00]: test beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting something in somebody's
hand that is going to cost them money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to pay first off for dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds have to go into some dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to pay for pots to put the dirt
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they've got to pay for lights to run
the plants under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they've got to pay for nutrients to
feed these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give these seeds to somebody who
really needs a crop of medicine to survive
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't understand they've got a test
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to say these could all be
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could all be hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could all be shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you breed, it doesn't work
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ugly people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ugly dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ugly animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you breed, you make some
ugly shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, it is your responsibility to
make sure you are improving cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: not fucking it up by putting out a bunch
of seeds that are going to take us
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards in the evolution of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your offspring is not better than the
plant you started with, you are not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: any justice unless you have isolated a
specific trait you were looking for and
[SPEAKER_00]: you wrote down in the beginning and
predicted it, not just said, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility to let the
grower know what you're giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also your responsibility to grow
those seeds out before you market them and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you have got a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put some hermaphrodites out for the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put some bullshit out for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if it's not better than the
parent, it's not worth putting out unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you have isolated a trait and improved on
that trait or stabilized something or
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected a problem within that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had a problematic plant,
why were you breeding it anyway unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that you wanted to fix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a bunch of brand new
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to grow them out yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep a journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to see if what you have
produced is worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've ran plenty of these seeds to
make sure you've got something that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't hermaphrodite, on you and that
isn't just fucking bullshit altogether,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got to stress test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to beat the shit out of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take a few and put them in a
room and mess up the light cycle and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they flip out on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a few other plants and put them in a
room and feed them way too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a few more plants, put them in
another room and mess with the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: real bad or make it too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just piss the plants off.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some of your plants and put them in a
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know this one guy that grows,
he gets powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time he grows, he's always
complaining about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always happens around the end of August
because it starts getting real moist here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts getting cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know every year, we've all got friends
that complain about powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a clone to that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if he gets powdery mildew on it
purposefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, go put this in that fucked up
corner in your room that's always got PM
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if this grows in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a friend that's always
getting spider mites, we all know that guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's always got fucking mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a couple of these clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how the mites react to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in his room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go get his bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have him report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and look and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there a bunch of mites on the plants
all around it and this one has 50% as many
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, 20% as many mites, anything
quantifiable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it quantifiable, quantitative,
cumulative, qualitative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, anything that you can fucking see
with your eyes and write down with your
[SPEAKER_00]: pen or you could text me and you could
say, bro, these plants you gave me are way
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in mites and the other ones aren't
or you could say, bro, these plants don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any mites and all the other plants
are coded, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test your plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then spread them out to the world if
they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, keep them to yourself and keep
playing with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to F to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to BX it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe select another male and re-breed
that male to everything else all over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding outdoors, you only get
one shot every year at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got an indoor grow that
you can grow these out in to play with
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the rest of the year and then
you can figure out what you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the ability to grow a
bunch out, maybe pass them out to some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, but make sure those friends know,
like I said, that these are tester beans
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow large populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you see the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you see what's really going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start seeing the outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting out Arise seeds for
several years now and for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of very similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, occasionally, I'll get a picture,
somebody will be like, look what I found,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because I've put out so many
seeds of the Arise that I'm starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting 35% THCA outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting crazy yielding outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting some that have purple and
smell like a fucking can of tennis balls
[SPEAKER_00]: and burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding new things because so many of
them have been put out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not common.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually that one that looks like a
golden goat plant with golden goat leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and a cushy structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually that thing that we see a lot
with the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that it's out there, I'm starting
to see these outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could rant on this forever,
obviously, but my point is grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, follow your state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break any rules I cannot condone or
can encourage you to break the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, grow as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cram a bunch in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill the trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill the tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow a bunch of little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to grow gigantic plants if
you just want to see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow some little ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them in six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fit a lot of those under a 400
watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them till they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're herms, you're going to know
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know within three, maybe four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to wait till five or six
weeks, but some will show you right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go baaah and they'll just be like,
oh, I got to throw these away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them you're going to be able to
tell these aren't worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some you're going to go, oh, I'm so glad I
bred this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have a bag full
of those seeds to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to see what
you've really created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the hard part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have created something that just
sucks, you can throw those seeds away or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can give them away, but make sure you
tell your friends like, these aren't very
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather you just throw them away or
feed them to a bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you got some kind of pet or
something, just mix them in with some bird
[SPEAKER_00]: feed or some shit, sprinkle them out in
the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you can find some creative place
to sprinkle them, but don't pass them
[SPEAKER_00]: along for other people to grow thinking
that they're going to grow high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine when all you've really given them
is some schwag weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to set people up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do that groundwork,
that legwork to find out what we've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out if it's worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're giving it to somebody,
like I said earlier, it costs them money
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are expecting an outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving them seeds and they're going
to take their trust in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You created something, they're going to
trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the mechanic putting your
fucking tire on or the mechanic doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something to your car that could go
totally wrong while you're flying down the
[SPEAKER_00]: highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now wheel comes off, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trust that guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much they're trusting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This crop could cost them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places, this crop could cost them
their freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing our seeds, the seeds we
made in these gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trusting us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say, Rasta Jeff put a lot
of love and research and care into these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust that this is going to be a usable
product in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to put that into dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was money.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, money, seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a container to put the dirt in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lights to run fucking plants under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of the time it takes,
your personal energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to run a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to run a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're investing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give people something that will turn
out in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not give them a time bomb to waste a
bunch of money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a reward in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've bred some shit and you grew a
bunch of it and you don't see anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that impresses you, don't let your ego get
in the way of you just throwing those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bred several crosses, so hopefully the
other ones make up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to talk about that one you
threw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flushed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they all sucked and I fed them to Crazy
Larry's parrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't put those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to, maybe you can F to it
and see if you can fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of a waste of time when
you've got other quality genetics to play
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then focus on the good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on the positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on the good shit that you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the quality genetics we're
playing with now, duds are uncommon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is always going to be the chance
that something just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been breeding for a long time
and we still have people born with
[SPEAKER_00]: anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes for any type of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, animals, anything where there's
genetics being crossed, things can go
[SPEAKER_00]: awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that was enough ranting
on one subject for one podcast.
