[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 477 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now and you
can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of Chem De La
Chem S1 Live Batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Chem D and I-95 on the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as petrol,
earth, and sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will completely agree with that
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you crack the jar open, it smells
gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a nice gassy, earthy aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once that settles down, that is when
that sour aroma kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I took a dab, the first thing I
noticed was that gassy, pungent flavor hit
[SPEAKER_00]: my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, it got earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it settles down, that gassy
sourness, skunkiness kind of settles on
[SPEAKER_00]: the tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives me a really delicious kind of
an aftertaste, sort of a thick layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton mouth that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been enjoying this trend in
the gassy, garlicky, savory sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors in the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least in my area, that seems to be a
trend in the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am really enjoying that gassy,
garlicky sort of a trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Garlic Banger, the Chem De La Chem,
the Fatso, the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about anything with that garlicky
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the Mac has got that pungent
aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything on that end of the spectrum has
been making me really happy lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious Chem De La Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: S1 Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, I am going to
read a couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, you know that I would
like to do some shout outs to a few of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big, giant Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out and a thank you to my friend
Glenn Gironi.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big, giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out and a thank you to James Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big thank you and a shout out
and a fist bump to Brett G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big, giant thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant handshake,
a Grow From Your Heart fist bump,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thank you to Keith K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want to send a giant Grow

[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to send a giant Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast shout out, a high five,
and a thank you to my friend Blackbird76.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
for the continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody out there would like to

[SPEAKER_00]: you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, this is the
portion of the show where I start reading
[SPEAKER_00]: listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice pile of emails here in
front of me, so let's not waste too much
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to the first message.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first message in today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is aired, you can use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a great way to start a
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rasta Jeff, I love your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the audio quality, the content,
and your talking style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's a great compliment right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you appreciate the audio
quality because I do put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: work into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of toys making me sound
like a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you enjoy the content
because that is all my brain coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes onto paper just a little bit,
very minimal notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just talk and put it out there,
so I'm glad you're enjoying the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my talking style, that's just me being
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to speak clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to speak in a way that I think most
people who speak English would be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and comprehend what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, you should definitely
be proud of the work you're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I tried a few other shows and
found that yours has just the right amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of fuck bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that I'm a huge potty mouth,
the Grow From Your Heart podcast is the
[SPEAKER_00]: show for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very interesting message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very interesting compliment and
a very interesting statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I'm dropping just the right
amount of f-bombs for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to be a potty mouth,
but I do try to be genuine and be myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say fuck sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do try to find that line between
being professional, but also being
[SPEAKER_00]: genuinely myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say whatever I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like censoring myself too much
makes me sound a little bit fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do meet me and we hang
out and I smell your weed, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go, that shit smells fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to look at me like,
wow, I've never heard you use profanity
[SPEAKER_00]: before and I'm blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you already know that that's who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who have been listening to the show
for a long time may remember that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, I tried to do a swear jar,
just the old fashioned, every time you say
[SPEAKER_00]: the F word, you got to put a dollar in the
swear jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually I gave that money to a
patient who needed some assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I gave that money to somebody,
I decided that was my final payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was allowed to say whatever I wanted
on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is no need to censor me from
being myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of being myself, I am stoned and
way off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back on track here with this
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I am the senior optical technician
for my dad's optical repair business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I repair binoculars,
mostly antiques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our shop is tucked into the back of my
dad's property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the majority of our business
shipped to us so we don't get many
[SPEAKER_00]: customers walking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We listened to the GFYH podcast on the
shop stereo for hours on end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have gone as far as the low two
hundreds in your episode feed on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were listening to the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may actually stumble across that old
swear jar episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's awesome that you guys
are listening to my show while you were
[SPEAKER_00]: working all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're exposing some other
employees to not only my F bombs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also to the grow knowledge and maybe
just opening up their minds to cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's somebody in the crew who
wasn't a big fan of cannabis and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you've accidentally turned them into an
activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoned and rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving with this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, big shout out to all of our friends
down there in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got quite a few friends who have left
Colorado to head down to Oklahoma to help
[SPEAKER_00]: get started down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also made a lot of new friends
who are in Oklahoma who are new to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry who are getting started
in the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody down there
in Oklahoma making the new medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving with this email because
I am obviously stoned and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Eric here says, I have been
studying a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been reading books, taking notes and
formulating my plan based on my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds very enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say your show plays a huge
part in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that your grow is going to
look a little bit like my grow or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: the version of my grow that you have
painted in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited about that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps going and it says basically I'm
doing everything the way you'd say to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it and referencing my literature for finer
details and specific information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm building a grow room in my garage that
measures four point five feet by eight
[SPEAKER_00]: feet that has an additional two by three
closet that will house a mother clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like we have a decent size
flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a decent sized mom and clone
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're really off to a good
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reading books.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were formulating a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you've got a nice floor plan
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I have a lot of plans to
optimize this grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I need to finish the main
construction to get growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I'll build a nice big cabinet
with an automated system and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you're eager to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to get things rolling so you
can get growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my question is, why don't you just do
it right the first time and build that big
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space that you dream of since you're
building it in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cost you time and money
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just go big or go home on that
first build instead of having to redo it
[SPEAKER_00]: all over again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation, but that
would be my first question is why aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: we just doing it the way we want to do it
the first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do shit twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to spend the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just do it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have that space available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have the budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first question is why are we going
to build it twice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the message it says, so for now,
the actual grow space inside the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: for veg and flour will be in a two by four
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to control the environment
as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working with limited floor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the time being, we are working with
very limited floor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to grow in a two by four
grow tent, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main goals is to really
control the environment as best as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't be too hard in such a small
environment if that tent is in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: room or a room which we can ventilate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on to say, I will be growing in
a soilless mix using Fox Farms Ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest and five gallon air pots under an
LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a great setup that will
work well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on using only a few nutrients,
only what's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small amount of nutrients that I do
use will be what you have recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow a very successful crop with
very minimal nutrients if you pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you'll be excited to hear
that I am making progress on the full mix
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to record that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make sure that I get it
right because you guys are going to rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to miss a single detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working that very heavily before I
press record.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm working on a full mix episode so
you can know what I feed my plants every
[SPEAKER_00]: single week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's keep moving on this email for
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I will be growing your Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on growing the shit out of Arise
before moving on to any other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop a pack of Arise seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a couple of keepers that you enjoy
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow those keepers a couple of times until
you narrow it down to your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then build a solid relationship with that
one cultivar and really learn how to dial
[SPEAKER_00]: in that one plant to reach its full
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I bought your seeds on
this past 420 from the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out if you need
new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is where we get to the question
part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have listened to your episode
on Arise and I took notes on it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I am writing the rough draft for
the veg phase of my plan, these questions
[SPEAKER_00]: came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend here is growing my strain
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a full episode on the Arise
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are planning their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are planning so far that they are
writing down notes for the veg phase and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have come up with some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question about Arise is,
does Arise like to be scrogged?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by a scrog I mean a screen of green,
which is when you put up a trellis net
[SPEAKER_00]: just above your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of letting that plant grow
straight up, you use the net to bend it
[SPEAKER_00]: over and make it grow horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can maximize your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of getting that plant straight up
into the light, you can bend the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: over and it will grow sideways from the
light to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do that for a little bit,
then it will start to grow back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it starts to grow straight up again,
you can grab that growth and tuck it under
[SPEAKER_00]: the next square in your trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can fill that space and have the
entire trellis filled with branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you flip it into flower, you will
fill your entire grow area with buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here is, does Arise like
to be scrogged?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise takes very well to scrogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise takes very well to popping and
twisting and topping and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulation and training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will actually recommend that you do
two, maybe three layers of trellis netting
[SPEAKER_00]: for your Arise plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally use the first net as a
spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plant is growing up and it's getting
tall, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use that first net to spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want one branch through each square of
my trellis net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spread out the plant a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is to work it to control
the height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I start bending the plant down
so it doesn't get too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That third one is to support those giant
buds that are gonna start developing
[SPEAKER_00]: around week four, five, six, and seven,
eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to consider adding another
trellis depending on how rapidly your buds
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grow in question is happening in a
grow tent with an LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not need that first trellis net
to work as a spreader as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to use that one as your
canopy control net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just be able to bend the plants
right into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't need that first net as a
spreader because you don't have as many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have as much growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the plants pressed together
as closely as I do in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I'm using
double-ended Gavita lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using three-gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting an auto-watering system,
and I've vegged the plants much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: than what you're able to even put in your
small grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do require at least two, sometimes
three, sometimes four layers of trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: netting in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is yes, a rise loves
to be scrogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is, what is her favorite
light cycle, 18 on, 6 off, or 16 on,
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 off?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest the 18 on and 6 off,
but if you want to get experimental,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost suggest a 20 hours on and 4
hours off light cycle with a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you have to pay attention to
your plant to dial this in, but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed that a rise likes a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has got some very tropical lineage to
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a Hawaiian sativa and an island
sweet skunk in her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that she has got some
tropical lineage, which means she probably
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting a lot of light and long
daytime periods somewhere down the line in
[SPEAKER_00]: her gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume that several of her parents
are used to getting a long daytime cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a rise seems to want a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pay attention to your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have what is called the daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they've had enough light,
they'll start shutting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this at the end of the light
cycle because the leaves just begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there's something wrong with
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's absolutely nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten enough light for the day
and they just said, that's it,
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just took a little nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just tip their hat over their eyes,
put their feet up and lean back and took a
[SPEAKER_00]: little sleeper for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the opportunity to run 20
hours on and 4 hours off, I would do that
[SPEAKER_00]: and pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you see some of the plants
starting to droop around 16, 17,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 hours in, then you can start adjusting
your timer accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go less than 18 on and 6 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of those tropical genetics that I
spoke of earlier, if you give a rise too
[SPEAKER_00]: little light and she gets root bound,
she will decide to flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a rise becomes root bound, it will try
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you keep a rise in the
appropriate size pot and make sure to give
[SPEAKER_00]: her plenty of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend starting with a 20 on
and 4 off and paying attention to what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start looking like they're
drooping late into the veg cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce it by an hour, reduce it by 2
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go less than 18 on and 6 hours
off because your plants may try to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of the big advantages of running
your lights for 20 on and 4 off is that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do click that timer to 12,
12, those arise plants are really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger into flower quite quickly because
you have just made a drastic change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have no question that it is time
to kick in to flower gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you were unable or uncomfortable
with running a 20 hour on and 4 hour off
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle, 18 and 6 will work for your
arise plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been working with this strain for
a very long time and I know that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: many phenotypes that would prefer a longer
day time veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Eric, I hope I helped you plan
your grow and plan your veg cycle a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more questions,
please send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You obviously know the email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message by saying,
thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We here at Sudarth Optical Repair love it
when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sincerely, Eric Sudarth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he added his Cannabuzz name.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Cannabuzz handle is Darth Lightbender.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you go follow Darth
Lightbender on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, once again, thank you for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep moving right through the
pile of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I've been
emailing intermittently with you and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted to let you know I am starting
to work with Arise as one of my long term
[SPEAKER_00]: project strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two people talking about Arise
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a diary started.
[SPEAKER_00]: At growdiaries.com under the moniker of,
I'm not sure if they want me to say their
[SPEAKER_00]: name, so I'm going to skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go on to say, I am only in the first
week as of now, but feel free to check it
[SPEAKER_00]: out from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys aren't aware, growdiaries
.com is a great website and it's exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very detailed grow diary.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I really like about
growdiaries.com is that I can click on
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics and it shows me everybody
who is growing or has grown an irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic strain and made a diary on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can just scroll through and I can
see our new friend here since he just gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that he pops up and there he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can click on his diary and see his
photos of Arise and any details or
[SPEAKER_00]: information that he has typed in to share
with us will be easily accessible for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can say, oh, he's feeding at
that and that's what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can share that kind of info with
other people who may want to grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain or you can go there yourself and
just take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're that type of an internet
cruiser, our buddy Grimble the Druid has a
[SPEAKER_00]: great grow diary is grown a lot of irie
genetics and some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he posts a lot of it to growdiaries
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check him out, but I'm stoned and
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm sure you have some better
shit to do than BS with me, but any advice
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way would not be refused.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first piece of advice would be to check
out episode number 329 of the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an entire episode about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume you've already heard
that, but if not, go check out number 329.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk in depth about the Arise strain on
episode 329, so check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm sure you just heard the two
little add-ons I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about Scrogging Arise and then we
just talked about timing for Arise in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got any more questions,
please send me an email and I will do my
[SPEAKER_00]: best to get those on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, my goal in all of this is to
be a solid home grower with aspirations of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something bigger in the cannabis
revolution we are currently in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am deep in Prohibition with no signs of
my state coming out soon, but I love this
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby and this plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Prohibition land and you
would like some help working toward
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, I would recommend finding
your local normal chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal is the national organization for
the reform of marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will be able to point you in the
right direction to get you in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said that your main goal is to
become a, what is the word you used,
[SPEAKER_00]: a solid home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got aspirations of doing
something bigger with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to be part of that
revolution, now is the time to join the
[SPEAKER_00]: battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you find your local normal
chapter, find your local cannabis activism
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter, whoever it is, wherever it is,
become involved with them however you can
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to make cannabis legal in your area so
you can be a bigger part of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap up the message with maybe one
day I will be consistent enough to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: test grower for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sign it with their name and
I'm not sure if they want their name said
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't reveal their identity,
but I will say thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing your grow of a rise
on growdiaries.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will definitely save that in my
favorites so I can go check that out at
[SPEAKER_00]: least once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see what your progress looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully one day you will be able to
test some brand new seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you for the great message
and I look forward to seeing your diary on
[SPEAKER_00]: growdiaries.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more email for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last email for today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, first off, man,
I just want to say thank you for all you
[SPEAKER_00]: do for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thank you for the recognition and you
are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, my name is
Kodiak from Oklahoma and I admittedly am
[SPEAKER_00]: new to finding your podcast, but I can't
get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, your expert
insight is invaluable and exactly what I
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a longtime smoker, but I am a total
newbie to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am nearing the end of my first grow and
I've been fairly pleased with my first
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I credit your knowledge for getting me
through my first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my growing goal is just to grow bomb
ass weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potency is what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got a good foundation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a new friend named Kodiak from
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are nearing the end of their first
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fairly pleased with the first
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing for themselves and their
main goal is potent bomb ass weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I have found to be a little
overwhelming as a new grower is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and additives alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first go around, I used Fox Farm
Ocean Forest Soil and Fox Farm Bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've added nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a four by four by eight grow tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, what would you recommend
for a small time grower to use nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: wise going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also bro, I totally imagine you as a hella
busy dude and I won't sweat in the
[SPEAKER_00]: slightest if you don't respond here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just figured I couldn't hurt to ask for
advice from the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sending good vibes to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap it up with take it easy and
happy growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I am a busy dude, but I've got
a podcast and I love helping people with
[SPEAKER_00]: my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are in luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started growing with the Fox Farms
Ocean Forest Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an acceptable soil, not the most
expensive, not the cheapest, not the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an acceptable quality,
soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you use the Fox Farms Bottled
Nutrients, probably the Trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't say exactly what you bought,
but you are asking what you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient wise to go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, I am writing an episode all
about my own personal feed mix that will
[SPEAKER_00]: take a couple of more weeks before I get
it out, but it is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, let's talk about a couple
of things we can add to this Fox Farms
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume you are using the
Trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a basic Trio that they sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grow store has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the hardware stores with
a garden center actually offer Fox Farms
[SPEAKER_00]: products at this time, so it is very
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing wrong with the Fox Farms
lineup and I have seen very high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product come from those nutrients,
but I do feel like it is a very entry
[SPEAKER_00]: level product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since you are a new grower,
that is perfect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farms nutrients are gentle enough that
if you do make a small mistake in your
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding, you will not destroy a crop with
one simple mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also very affordable and it is
very easy to mix when you've only got
[SPEAKER_00]: three, maybe four or five bottles to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel like there is nothing wrong
with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel that there are better options
once you become a better grower and you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what to watch for in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this situation, I am going to
assume that you are using the Fox Farms
[SPEAKER_00]: Trio as your base and that is the Grow
Big, the Tiger Bloom, and what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Big Bloom I believe is what
that's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also offer three powdered
nutrients, Open Sesame, Cha-ching,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's the name of that third one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beastie Blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used Fox Farms a really long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might have been the first or second
product that I attempted to use and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: was not satisfied with it so I moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just assume you were using the
trio to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you've got the three powders,
maybe you've got some Bush Doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's talk about a couple of things
you can add to your nutrient recipe to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance your next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend some sort of microbes
in your feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many options when it comes to
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbe products can be very affordable
and microbe products can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: astronomically expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you select any product for your
grow, do a little bit of research on the
[SPEAKER_00]: product itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what it is made from, find out who is
making it, and find out how you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend your dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then find a product that fits your price
range and add that to your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to use the most expensive
microbe products you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't afford something really
expensive, use the microbes you can afford
[SPEAKER_00]: because some microbes are way better than
no microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding beneficial microbes to your
nutrient mix will be beneficial in many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first way is that it will simply
increase root mass development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will grow stronger, fatter,
thicker, healthier roots in less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fatter roots, bigger fruits, more healthy
roots, more healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding microbes to our nutrient regimen
will also help keep our plants pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have already developed colonies of
beneficial fungus in our root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: there won't be room for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything else tries to come in,
those microbes go, nope, this is our turf,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would always recommend some sort of a
microbe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I keep saying that there are many
microbe products available at many
[SPEAKER_00]: different price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me recommend three of my favorite
microbes to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will recommend Recharge, I will
recommend Plus Life, and I will recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are three equal but very
different microbe products and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: all fall at very different price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use any microbe product
individually or you can use most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed together, but I definitely recommend
you use at least one microbe product at
[SPEAKER_00]: least once a week in your nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I would add is a
quality microbe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got a few other recommendations
that I would consider adding to that Fox
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add a product called Shine to my
lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Shine is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is made by the folks that make Veg
Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is part of the Veg Bloom lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available from Hydroponic Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at Hydroponic-Research
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why I recommend
Shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Shine adds to my bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Shine adds to my trichome density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Shine adds to my aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that if I use Shine early
in the flowering phase, it slows down part
[SPEAKER_00]: of my early stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would add Shine to my mix and you
will see an increase in bud density and
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome density and possibly an increase
in aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got microbes making things
work a little more quickly in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got some Shine beefing up the
buds, giving you more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I would add would be some
fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would recommend Ruby from our
friends at New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would use five milliliters of Ruby
for every gallon of nutrient solution you
[SPEAKER_00]: mix up every time you feed those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why do I suggest fulvic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are feeding our plants high quality
expensive nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fulvic acid essentially makes those
nutrients more available and more
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbable by our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the short explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sort of like that gas additive that
they sell for your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, yeah, that gas works great in
your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the car go vroom, vroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add a little bit of this shit to the gas
and the car will go vroom, vroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: vroom, vroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically what fulvic acid does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you just a few more RPMs,
a couple more horsepower, a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more turbo charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes all of those expensive nutrients
we are feeding to the plant more
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbable, more available to our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest or recommend adding
some fulvic acid to your feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite fulvic acid product is again,
Ruby from New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use Ruby at five milliliters per
gallon of everything I mix up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I mix nutrients, I put five milliliters
of Ruby in every gallon every time I feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point with this many new
additives, we have kind of turbocharged
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pay attention to CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting a CalMag deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a CalMag product,
this may be the time to consider adding
[SPEAKER_00]: CalMag to your lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what a CalMag deficiency looks
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are currently not adding any
calcium or magnesium supplements to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with this current nutrient feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these extra additives we just put
in the mix, we may need to watch for a
[SPEAKER_00]: CalMag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we start boosting up our
nutrients, I recommend you find the chart
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet that shows the cannabis
leaf and all of the nutrient symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies and toxicities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will show you a cannabis leaf and it
will say nitrogen, deficiency or toxicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, toxicity or deficiency and it
will show you what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good idea of what the CalMag
deficiency looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good idea of what the nitrogen
deficiency looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good idea of what phosphorus and
potassium deficiencies look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when those things come up,
we know how to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we're focusing on CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn what a CalMag deficiency looks like
and think about if it's time to start
[SPEAKER_00]: adding CalMag to your nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've added some microbes, we've added
some shine, we put some fulvic acid in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need some CalMag now that we're
going so hard with these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're turbocharging them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we possibly do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point I would recommend a product
called Winter Frost from New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter Frost is used right at the end of
the flowering phase just before flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you use Winter Frost and
shine together, you will see tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to be careful not to burn
your plants when you are adding this many
[SPEAKER_00]: additives to your recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you start slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you introduce Winter Frost
to your feed mix, maybe go half strength
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't have any adverse effects to
the plants, increase the dosage on the
[SPEAKER_00]: next feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you keep notes of what you are
feeding your plants so that you know how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you fed it and how the plant
responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start lightly, maybe a quarter,
maybe 50% of the recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed it that, see how the plant responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time, feed it more if you want to,
feed it less if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go full strength right away when
you are adding this many additives to your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've still got a couple of things I'd
like to recommend, so let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I may suggest adding some
enzymes to your nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes work with the microbes,
enzymes work with the fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they help to make all of the nutrients
more available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes will also work with the microbes
and the fulvic acid to keep the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend adding an enzymatic
product to your nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next product is just something
that I personally add to my personal grows
[SPEAKER_00]: because I believe it adds aroma and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think this product brings out the
skunky, funky, dirty, cushy aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the product I am talking about is
called Liquid Karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid Karma is from Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more of a supplement, but it is a
product that I add for aroma and flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and possibly a little bit of bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could possibly be a placebo effect,
but I do feel that when I use Liquid Karma
[SPEAKER_00]: that my buds smell just a little bit
stinkier than when I don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the last specific product I am
going to recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also want to add a bloom booster
to your regimen, but I don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific bloom booster recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countless options available for
bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, stay tuned to the show because in
the very near future I am going to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: very detailed episode, possibly two
episodes on my very specific nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe and how I mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said I would add microbes
because microbes will make the roots grow
[SPEAKER_00]: faster and keep pathogens away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would add some shine because shine
is going to give us more trichomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: more bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who doesn't like denser trichome
covered buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would add some fulvic acid to make
all of those nutrients better available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we may need some Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got a little bit random and I went
with some winter frost, some Liquid Karma,
[SPEAKER_00]: some enzymes, and possibly a bloom
booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I have opened your mind,
given you a few options of things you can
[SPEAKER_00]: add to your Fox Farms lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, any of those products will be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them in conjunction with each
other will really do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always recommend some fulvic acid
because you're already paying for the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not add that fulvic acid to actually
make all of the nutrients available to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we've got the basic nutrition
covered, that's when we want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: adding things to give us beefier,
bulkier plants with more stank and more
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we move in to the products
like shine, the winter frost, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually we end with bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I have inspired you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I did not overwhelm you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn more about
nutrients and you want to learn exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm talking about, what I'm mixing,
stay tuned because I like to keep teasing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a few episodes, I'm going to put
out a very detailed episode on exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what I feed and how I feed my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank my new friend Kodiak in
Oklahoma for the great email.
