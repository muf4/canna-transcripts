appreciate each and every one of you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not already subscribed to the show
please do click that subscribe button also
[SPEAKER_00]: click that notification bell every time i
put out a new episode you will get a
[SPEAKER_00]: notification you will not miss any
episodes also there are 768 episodes of
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast they hear a lot of times hey
bro i wish you'd put out more content we
[SPEAKER_00]: miss you doing two shows a week there are
767 more episodes that you could go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to that if you haven't heard
all of them i do encourage you to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to the old content there's a
lot of great stuff in there still a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great uh grow knowledge grow information
grow tech to learn uh even if the episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't completely current that info is
still completely useful also a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people do laugh and enjoy watching the
older shows going back and seeing how the
[SPEAKER_00]: show has evolved how my approach to
podcasting how the gear how everything has
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved my point is go watch a lot of the
old episodes i've been noticing that some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them have been getting more views and
more clicks so thank you for that once
[SPEAKER_00]: again thank you for 10 000 subscribers on
the youtube all right i feel like that is
[SPEAKER_00]: enough rambling here at the top of the
show i did say that i was going to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: grow questions i've got a couple of great
emails right here in front of me this one
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from my friend kip big shout out to
my buddy kip it goes a lot like this it
[SPEAKER_00]: says what's up rasta jeff what's up kip
good to see you thank you for the patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: support thank you for the great question
it says i've got a quick question for you
[SPEAKER_00]: i was wondering in your experience what is
the best practice for flipping into flour
[SPEAKER_00]: after taking clones that is a very good
question kip goes on to say i typically
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a couple of weeks so i can make sure
my roots or my cuts root but i've been
[SPEAKER_00]: getting nearly 100 rooting success lately
uh the funny part about that is as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get too confident and you do flip your
plants early that's when you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have rooting problems i'm not trying to
curse you i'm not trying to jinx you that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the way that the grow gods do treat us
so be very careful with that it goes on it
[SPEAKER_00]: does say is there a timeline you should
wait to flip after taking cuts or can you
[SPEAKER_00]: take a cut from a healthy plant and then
go straight into flour i'm doing a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: large phenol hunt right now of 36 plants
congratulations bro that sounds like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fun in my two by four with solo cups
and i want to keep them small also thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of the great content every week
and for the bomb genetics enjoy your week
[SPEAKER_00]: brother from kip i had some notes on here
but as i was reading this i realized
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing this in solo cups and i'm
going to give one more detail before i
[SPEAKER_00]: read the notes that i actually have
written to avoid taking clones from 36
[SPEAKER_00]: solo cups have you thought about reveging
i know that is totally derailing your plan
[SPEAKER_00]: you're asking me about cloning which i
will get to but in my mind if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running solo cups those plants are going
to get they're only going to get so big
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want them too large in a solo
cup especially in your limited space large
[SPEAKER_00]: plant count there i would just grow them
very small then i would flower them then i
[SPEAKER_00]: would mark i would keep my favorites then
when i come to harvest i would not harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it i'd leave the bottom buds from
every one of them then smoke it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: revedge your favorites that's what i would
do i would revedge them instead of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: clones for plants this small but i don't
want to ruin your whole strategy i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to rethink your whole program that's
just a suggestion that is what would rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: jeff do i would just revedge now let's
focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: question because that's what you want to
know so the first scenario i want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about is if we were to take clones from
the bottom of the plant a lot of times the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will grow up we leave the tops
alone we clean up the bottom right before
[SPEAKER_00]: we go into flower that's called
lollipopping or shaving the legs you clean
[SPEAKER_00]: up the bottom branches and then take the
suckers off the lower branches that you do
[SPEAKER_00]: leave when you're doing that i find that
to be a great opportunity to take a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of clones the bottoms will have two four
maybe six clones available right there on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom you can cut off if you are
taking clones from the bottom you can cut
[SPEAKER_00]: those off and you could in theory put your
plant into flower right away because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need any hormones to move around you
don't need any recovery time because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking stuff from the bottom you're
just completely removing it the hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: are already at the top where you want them
so if you're going to take stuff from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom when you're lollipopping you can do
that basically anytime they don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery time for that again that one
detail you should focus on is do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: roots on your clones or are you confident
that your clones will root before you put
[SPEAKER_00]: your other plants into flower i still kind
of use that same practice i don't flower
[SPEAKER_00]: the room until i see roots on the other
clones that i've taken so i know i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: backups that's kind of a practice that i
do employ let's talk about another option
[SPEAKER_00]: now if you do choose to take clones from
the top of the plants then yes i would
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for some recovery time when i'm
growing larger plants i do generally top
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant once or twice that main apical
top makes a beautiful clone a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: i will take the two bottoms and the main
top right out of the plant and use those
[SPEAKER_00]: as my three clones in my cloner or in my
clone machine so that's where my first
[SPEAKER_00]: three clones will come from if i take that
top clone i do allow the plants at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 14 days to recover you want the
hormones in that plant to move around so
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant can establish who's got the new
apical dominant top that's part of why we
[SPEAKER_00]: top it is to confuse that plant's hormones
and it goes wait we had one dominant top
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the plant's goal is to have one
dominant top to get up there and get
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated and the rest of the branches
are just kind of extra branches to get
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen to keep life going but when you
take out that main top all the others go
[SPEAKER_00]: hey i've got the chance to be the top so
we got to let that action happen and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll all even out and all try to grow
up and be tops and you get a bunch more
[SPEAKER_00]: main tops on the plant we do need to allow
some time for those hormones to move
[SPEAKER_00]: around and for things to recover after we
do take the main top out you could
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetically go directly into flower but
you will get a much smaller yield your top
[SPEAKER_00]: buds won't be as large as they could be
and that's always where most of the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: and the yield and the bulk comes from is
that top part of the plant there so you
[SPEAKER_00]: would be handicapping yourself kneecapping
crippling yourself if you were to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: too quickly another thing to think about
there is if you were trellising if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: topping or if you're scrogging excuse me
if you're working them into a net you may
[SPEAKER_00]: want to allow some time to work them in
the net let them recover a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: before you do put them into flower that
will help them grow like i said bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: fatter buds and that is the main goal is
those big fat juicy nuggets so if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the quick answer if you're taking
clones from the bottom go ahead and flip
[SPEAKER_00]: it if you're cutting the tops do allow
some time for recovery my friend kip thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the great great question bro i do
appreciate it i look forward to hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: back from you and i do look forward to
seeing how your 36 plant phenol hunt goes
[SPEAKER_00]: in your small space if you need any help
have any questions need some guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: please do reach out for that because i've
done basically this exact thing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to do and i do wish you the best
of luck all right i'm going to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: show moving i do have one more great
question right here in front of me this
[SPEAKER_00]: one comes from our friend shawn it doesn't
have a lot of info about the name they
[SPEAKER_00]: want me to use so we're going to call you
shawn today this one was quick and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point it said do a video collecting pollen
another pollinating a female then it says
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done the sts and clone cutting just
a thought but i know you're busy man i
[SPEAKER_00]: love these quick to the point emails these
are awesome um let's talk about this so
[SPEAKER_00]: shawn said do a video collecting pollen
that is a great idea however um youtube
[SPEAKER_00]: does not like it when i post videos that
do contain live plants uh youtube has
[SPEAKER_00]: removed a couple of my videos because
they've got live plants in them uh youtube
[SPEAKER_00]: has also been taking down uh videos and
channels uh that are part of our community
[SPEAKER_00]: so i'm trying to be extra careful you may
have noticed sometimes i'm more careful
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of the words that i do use i'm
definitely going to be more careful with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the content i would like to keep
the channel alive we do a lot of education
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a great community here the
comment section is always beautiful you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys keep going in the comments i love
that but i have to be very careful with
[SPEAKER_00]: what i'm putting out on youtube so i
cannot do a pollen collection video but i
[SPEAKER_00]: can describe it with words that should be
safe so let me talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting pollen i've got too many notes
on the table here let me cover up this
[SPEAKER_00]: other page so i'm not so distracted yes i
do have the add um big shout out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: friend who made the lemon jeffrey
concentrate it is working bro anyway let's
[SPEAKER_00]: get back on track let's talk about
collecting pollen i can't show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because of youtube rules that's my
first note here um the first thing i want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about when it comes to collecting
pollen is uh know your mail what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: working with do you know that that's a
good mail where'd you get that make a good
[SPEAKER_00]: decision there then the next thing i'm
going to talk about is uh no wind and no
[SPEAKER_00]: disruptions and no sprays we don't want a
lot of wind in the room so you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put your plant into flower and around day
14 or day 17 maybe 21 ish you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting a lot of pollen we don't
need any wind in the room that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: blow that pollen right off of your plant
you're not going to be able to collect it
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want to spray anything in the
room because that of course is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the pollen we don't want that
basically no disruptions to this plant try
[SPEAKER_00]: not to nudge it bump it don't move it
around keep that mail plant in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: place so that it can basically build up a
whole bunch of pollen for you to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: alright so there are several ways to
collect the pollen let's jump into that
[SPEAKER_00]: part the first method that i'm going to
talk about is while the plant is still
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and standing and then eventually we
will cut this plant down and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways to gather the pollen there the
first way this plant is standing you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got your growing plant it is growing just
like a normal plant except this one's a
[SPEAKER_00]: boy it's got balls all over it one thing
you can do to collect the pollen is to put
[SPEAKER_00]: a collection vessel underneath the plant
i've seen people use a big mirror i've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen people use dinner plates i've seen
people use just a sheet of glass something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that underneath the plant that will
collect the pollen that you can scrape it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and scoop it up very easily is a really
good idea make sure that whatever you use
[SPEAKER_00]: is non-static i've seen people use like a
little plate that was plastic or a
[SPEAKER_00]: styrofoam plate and the pollen actually
fell out of the plant and static
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity pushed that pollen right away
and we did not collect any pollen at all
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was static on the plastic or
styrofoam plate don't do that i recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: glass maybe a pyrex dish maybe a glass
dinner plate if you've got a big mirror
[SPEAKER_00]: that is perfect so imagine that you just
put the mirror down and this is just an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea you put the mirror down under the
plant and then you set the plant the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: pot right on top of that mirror then all
of the pollen that falls down will land
[SPEAKER_00]: right on that mirror or that sheet of
glass or whatever you have chosen now that
[SPEAKER_00]: does sound kind of sketchy because you're
putting a plant right onto the mirror if
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a small plant it's not a big deal
if you got a thick mirror it's not a big
[SPEAKER_00]: deal you got to run some risks if you want
to win the game sometimes now another
[SPEAKER_00]: thing we could talk about is uh you just
let that pollen fall right onto that
[SPEAKER_00]: mirror so it'll start pollinating it'll
fall right down on there another thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do is sometimes i'll take a plant
instead of letting it grow straight up
[SPEAKER_00]: i'll just grab it right in the middle and
i'll put a tie on it and i'll bend that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant down maybe like a 45 maybe a 90
degree angle i'm not sure where my arm is
[SPEAKER_00]: right now i'm not good with angles i guess
uh that's a 45 we'll put it at a 45 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: angle and then we'll put the collection
vessel underneath that now the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tipped it's going to fall more
directly onto the vessel you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the 360 falling of pollen you got one more
long distance of pollen falling maybe like
[SPEAKER_00]: a glass baking sheet a pyrex sheet or
something like that would be perfect to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect the pollen underneath there so you
can just let it grow and that pollen will
[SPEAKER_00]: start falling out that's a really easy way
to do it another way that you could do it
[SPEAKER_00]: is to start tapping the plant if you've
got it growing straight up or if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got it tipped over i go in there i
honestly i'm a drummer i've got drumsticks
[SPEAKER_00]: laying around i go in with the drumstick
and a collection vessel usually a pyrex
[SPEAKER_00]: dish sometimes a jar and i'll just hold
that dish or that pyrex dish or the jar
[SPEAKER_00]: right up to the plant and i'll just start
tapping the plant and the pollen falls
[SPEAKER_00]: right out into my dish i just use the
drumstick tap tap tap when you do this
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen is going to go everywhere i
recommend maybe wearing a mask maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: covering up if you've got other plants
around that you don't want to pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely take precautions for that you
may want to wet those plants while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: messing with the pollen then clean
yourself up make sure that so water
[SPEAKER_00]: deactivates pollen you guys if you've got
pollen on you in your dreadlocks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes in your beard on your clothes
wherever else i haven't said on your shoes
[SPEAKER_00]: is where i think i'm headed water will
deactivate that so you can get a pump
[SPEAKER_00]: spray or a water bottle spray yourself
down real good or hop in the shower that
[SPEAKER_00]: will get rid of all that active pollen
also if you spray down the plants the
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols are wet they are less likely to
receive the pollen at that time that
[SPEAKER_00]: should help you out a little bit but be be
very careful because that pollen is very
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny and one flake of pollen equals one
seed and you can get a bunch of pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: just stuck in your dreadlocks and your arm
hair and your clothes on your shoes it
[SPEAKER_00]: does not take much so be very careful with
the pollen so as soon as you start tapping
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant pollen is going to start coming
out and going flying a lot of it will fall
[SPEAKER_00]: straight down tap gently just enough maybe
tap lower on the branch tap down here and
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen up here will start falling out
don't be too aggressive also don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any fans on don't breathe too heavily and
definitely do not sneeze because you will
[SPEAKER_00]: blow your pollen all over the place all of
your work will be a waste of time that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen will go everywhere as long as this
plant is alive it will continue to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen up till probably week 10 week 11
whenever it starts burning out it'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll go into senescence and give up but
you'll get plenty of pollen out of it you
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep that plant pollinating and just
keep tapping it every few days and more
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen will come out or leave your
collection vessel underneath it and more
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen will land onto that glass plate or
that pyrex dish if you've got it bent over
[SPEAKER_00]: more pollen will fall out i've seen guys
just run a ganja plant a male ganja plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in the extra bathroom or in the window
just in the sunlight in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: season right now outdoor season the plant
would go into flower within 21 days excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: me within 21-ish days it would start
banging out pollen we could collect pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: really easily just by putting a plant in
this window right here and give it some
[SPEAKER_00]: time if we gave it a dark period if we
turned off all the all the lights in the
[SPEAKER_00]: house and just use the the sunlight the
natural sunlight so if you put a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bathroom close the door open the
window let the sun function on that it
[SPEAKER_00]: would make pollen for you if it were a
male it would begin to make pollen for you
[SPEAKER_00]: you could collect pollen that easily now
we can continue to collect pollen until
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got as much as we need we do not
need a lot once you feel like this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is done now it is time to cut the plant
down i would gently carefully if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: try to remove the largest leaves from the
plant not a big deal if you can't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: without disturbing the plant i'm kind of a
defoliation ninja i could just grab with
[SPEAKER_00]: the thumb and the forefinger and just take
off the leaf real easily it just pops
[SPEAKER_00]: right off for me if you don't have those
ninja skills maybe don't do it but now is
[SPEAKER_00]: a good time to take off some of the bigger
leaves then i usually get a pyrex dish
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got a pyrex dish that my i don't even
know where it came from it probably used
[SPEAKER_00]: to be made to make used to make brownies
or some sort of casserole i have
[SPEAKER_00]: commandeered it that is now my pollen
collection vessel it's about probably 16
[SPEAKER_00]: inches long and eight or nine inches wide
a beautiful pan to go in the oven no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer that now it is my pollen dish i
usually take the top off the plant or if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a small plant maybe i'll take the
whole plant chop it once i feel like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: super dry i'll kind of crunch the tops of
my fingers all the last bits of pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: will fall out i'll lift that male plant
and i just give it one of these i kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: grab it at the base and use my fingers
just to kind of pull all the the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: right off of there into the dish to make
sure to get the last of it then i'll
[SPEAKER_00]: discard that male plant he's done his job
i've got a dish with pollen in it now i
[SPEAKER_00]: let that dry i want the pollen dry i'm
gonna say it again bone bone dry i said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier water will destroy your pollen so
at this point we want to get that bone dry
[SPEAKER_00]: i would get tweezers i'd get some sort of
sifting device and pull out all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: debris all of the male flowers anything
that is not pollen needs to come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: here let it dry really dry then put it in
a container an airtight dry container i
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer a glass container maybe a glass
vial with a silicate pack i'm going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: it again a silicate pack not a boveda pack
we want the package that sucks up the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture not maintains a humidity level we
want zero humidity in this package so put
[SPEAKER_00]: a put a silicate pack in there some people
use rice to absorb the moisture that may
[SPEAKER_00]: work for you i don't know how much rice
per fall up her pollen honestly i don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that i use the the silicate pack so put
that in there to absorb the moisture and
[SPEAKER_00]: get your package super dry before you seal
it up then when you seal it up i do
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you put that in a cool dry dark
place i keep my pollen in the crisper
[SPEAKER_00]: drawer in the refrigerator and it seems to
work for about two maybe three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes up to six months it depends on
the pollen uh kind of depends on i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know i've had a lot of variables so i
don't know what it really depends on some
[SPEAKER_00]: of it stores real well some of it just
doesn't now the way that i usually do this
[SPEAKER_00]: is i don't generally collect a lot of
pollen the way that i usually do it is i
[SPEAKER_00]: will run the male plant i'll run the
female plants i'll time them perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: when it is time for pollination i drag
that boy plant right to the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and i give them a good shake and all
that pollen will come out and i'll watch
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen go everywhere there are no
fans on i usually do it in the dark i try
[SPEAKER_00]: not to breathe i try not to sneeze let the
pollination happen then i'll wait four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five days let that pollen build up again
i'll go back in there give them another
[SPEAKER_00]: shake then when i'm done shaking him i'll
cut him down and actually go and smack
[SPEAKER_00]: that male plant either against the fan or
against the light i've got lights with the
[SPEAKER_00]: shield right at the glass uh the glass
reflector right above it i'll hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: light and the pollen just comes raining
down yeah it makes a little extra cleanup
[SPEAKER_00]: there's pollen everywhere i gotta clean up
anyway so i smack that dead plant that i
[SPEAKER_00]: just cut it down i smack that plant right
up against the light all the pollen comes
[SPEAKER_00]: raining down then i will discard that male
plant because i don't need it anymore but
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't even keep the male around i don't
collect the pollen i just cut him down
[SPEAKER_00]: smack him around get the pollen everywhere
he's done his job and now he's free to go
[SPEAKER_00]: now you've got pollen in your collection
vessel uh you've probably stored it you've
[SPEAKER_00]: had in the fridge for a little while now
your female plants are ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination let's talk about how to do
that there are several ways you could do
[SPEAKER_00]: it if you've got a lot of pollen you could
just go in there and maybe turn off all
[SPEAKER_00]: the fans and just go right above the uh
right above the canopy and just open up
[SPEAKER_00]: your pollen whatever it's in and just give
it a few taps and just let some pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: just gently fall out you'll see it just
gently sprinkle the plants or if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to carefully pollinate one or two branches
you could get a q-tip or a paintbrush and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pull the branch down that you want
maybe even pull that plant out of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: and do this in a more isolated space take
that female plant take that pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: just paint the branches that you want with
the pollen put a q-tip or the paintbrush
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the pollen and then carefully
apply that pollen to the pistols of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant you want to pollinate then mark that
branch if you only do a couple of branches
[SPEAKER_00]: mark it keep an eye on that branch then
when those seeds are ready you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're right there in that one those two
branches that you pollinated be very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful because i've talked about how easy
it is to accidentally pollinate things if
[SPEAKER_00]: you sneeze if you breathe too heavily if
you bump that jar if you bump the baggie
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen will go flying around you may
accidentally pollinate things but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are careful you should be able to use a
q-tip a paintbrush something of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature and get in there and scoop a little
bit of pollen out of that container and
[SPEAKER_00]: just apply it perfectly to the plants or
you could take it and you could just
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkle it right above the plants i've
seen guys pour it onto a piece of paper
[SPEAKER_00]: and just blow on it but when you blow on
it that shit goes everywhere it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move more than you expect it takes one or
two test runs maybe to figure out how hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to blow to get the pollen to move but dump
it onto a little piece of paper and just
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a and just let it blow the reason
you don't go straight onto your hand you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys is because your sweat will destroy
the pollen that moisture will has the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity the potential to destroy your
pollen so let me make sure that i've
[SPEAKER_00]: answered most of the question here collect
the pollen tap it just bend the plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: and tap it collect that shit or let the
plant get finished up cut it down when
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got enough pollen and then start
fucking smacking that plant on flowers or
[SPEAKER_00]: put in a container collect the pollen that
way get the pollen super dry that is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most important parts here use a
silicate pack do not use a boveda pack dry
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen then use a paintbrush or a
q-tip to apply the pollen to the branches
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to pollinate when you have
successful pollination you will see the
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols kind of curl in the pistols look
like the dandelions the hairs you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: call them that part of sticking out when
you put pollen on there that part will
[SPEAKER_00]: curl up and turn brown and get withered
that is a sign of successful pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention to the parts you've
pollinated over the next few weeks watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the development around four or five six
weeks in some plants go faster than others
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys i can't tell you exactly how long
it will take four or five six weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll start seeing the seeds getting
harder around five or six weeks start
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling one or two out randomly and just
squeezing them and see how hard they are
[SPEAKER_00]: around week seven or week eight they'll
definitely be ready by then you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice batch of seeds the way i harvest
seeds we'll just quickly do this since
[SPEAKER_00]: we're here i've done a full show on it but
we'll go quickly when i harvest for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: right before harvest time i do a heavy
defoliation we don't need all those leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: in there also i turn my lights back to
18.6 shortly after pollination to speed up
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to get the seeds ripe but i'm
getting ahead of myself i chop i heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate i chop
[SPEAKER_00]: down the plants i hang them upside down i
let them get completely dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and then once they're dry as fuck i just
do this and crumble them up until i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: joint rolling material pull out all the
sticks pull out all the junk then pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: all the seeds honestly the rest of that
material has been so beat up that it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into the compost bin or the bokashi bucket
i do not even use it that may offend a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people but it is garbage at this point
there's so much chlorophyll and just junk
[SPEAKER_00]: and dust in it that you don't even want it
all right i think i've covered the best
[SPEAKER_00]: part of my pollination and collecting
pollen recipe my secret here my guide if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got any more questions please do
