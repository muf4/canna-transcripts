[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 40 of the I
Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining me at the table again is our good
buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going out there, podcast land?
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast land, internet world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys are listening to us
while you're driving to work or playing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden or doing something fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're doing, I hope you got a
dab or a fat joint or a bowl of something
[SPEAKER_00]: super dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking some live resin,
some bounty killer, no, not bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it is bounty killer live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Capelten live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I just lied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Capelten live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the dude that grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an extra special shout out to the guy
that blasted, extracted it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is super tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would imagine that the iry genetics
guy would have all those iry genetics dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't even keep them straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice to watch my friends grow
my genetics and then to have one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: good brothers extract it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he gets his hash back and he
calls me, dude, come over and get some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this hash I just had made from your
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hell yeah, I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a nice gram of heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was grateful dog and there was
Capelten live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that was tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It left a, I keep saying citronella
candles sort of scent in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into that, that was a great
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I want to take one quick second and
give a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do this at the end of the show,
but we got to do a special shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra special shout out to my ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence has been sick as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out just recently that his
appendix had ruptured inside of him and he
[SPEAKER_00]: had to have it removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm so glad you're on the way to
recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were super worried about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stressing out, worrying about my
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you more than you ever will
realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Spence, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody send your love and energy to
getting Spence better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get better, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, feller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, buddy, get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to shoot some hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence is going to win the secret cup
finals in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minus an appendix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can he fly cheaper?
[SPEAKER_00]: He just lost some weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't your appendix only like about an
inch long anyway?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I actually looked it up today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing almost killed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost killed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he was pretty bad shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's almost, it's completely
worthless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me, what does your appendix
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at him and said, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full of a poison vial.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just stick this inside of a human
and wait for it to rupture one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, creator.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the self-destruct switch you gave
us all, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since we're sending out love and
energy to people that need some help,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big, huge healing vibe to
my good friend, Angela.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't been feeling well the past
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got some medical things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of private to her,
so we don't need to elaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, dude, send a lot of healing vibes to
Angela.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_00]: Care a lot about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see you smiling again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to jump in and do a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the shout out for Angela.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she heard it, she said that I
made it sound like there's something wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with her vagina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to assure you, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with Angela's vagina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's get off the somber vibe and
get into a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do owe another shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two more shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I owe a shout out to the man Afro
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with this dude,
Afro Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sings that song, Because I Got High.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played a show in a town near me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little VIP party at a dispensary
called The Spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to The Spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Robert?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Vegas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys are listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everyone at The Spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me to see Afro Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a couple of photos with Afro Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually Angela's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got me the little VIP hookup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again, Angela.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked in and Afro Man was taking
pictures with people and doing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: quick private meet and greet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he saw me and he was, oh, shit,
come here, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took pictures with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted my photos up on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He blew off a lot of people to come hang
out with Rasta Jeff for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owners of The Spot said that he could
come smoke with me, but he probably would
[SPEAKER_00]: not make it to his show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he opted to not smoke with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, you look like you might
murder me with some smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then you're also, yeah,
at a dispensary and unfortunately not
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to smoke at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They totally knew I was going to drive him
off in my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had you just been able to hand him a
joint, it would have been a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he did do a show in Colorado
Springs after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't talk about what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about a couple of other
things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout outs are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody that's listening to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this is episode 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made it 40 episodes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you guys, the episodes are
getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing more preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing more planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the next few episode topics
already listed of what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up in a couple of episodes,
we're going to do an episode about
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a couple of people ask me,
tell me about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does all this NPK five three nine on
my bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this shit mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I be feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to cover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also our friend Ross Cola,
King Cola, Sean is going to come be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't called him yet, but he did send
me his phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got his phone number so I could text
him and ask him to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hypes a growing system that he has
labeled organic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for quite a while and he
has he has the approach that I hope to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not where he is yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a very environmentally friendly,
environmentally sustainable way of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a little bit to impress me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he does these fermentations that
look delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would almost if I didn't know
what was in there, some of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: would look tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, no, they really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it smells good because of the
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let Sean tell you about his stuff
when we get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Ross Cola, King Cola and
organic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get him on here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guys, I'm saying that word,
but it doesn't cost money anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually quoting this guy's brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't charge me on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you can charge me for.

bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got the roots, 707 for 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentioned the I Grow Culture podcast for
commercial pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there today and she had no problem
typing in commercial pricing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got myself a bag of soil for my
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, can I tell them what they'll pay for
that bag of, what did I get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Light Warrior?
[SPEAKER_00]: That bag was less than 18 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was $17 and some change for that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that's a $25 bag of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saved eight bucks just by using or by
telling them, hey, I listened to the I
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go get yourself a bag of soil,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even, you know, when you get a
discount some places, they act like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, don't I owe you pricing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do give me a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you tell them that you're
listening to the I Grow Culture podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and also check out their website,
hygrodenver.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write it down because I thought I
remembered and apparently I just forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hygrodenver.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we also have hygro.us.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have Hygro Pueblo has a
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Pueblo and you want to team
up on their Facebook, check it out because
[SPEAKER_00]: they post a lot of cool stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting around to using it a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to keep up with all the
social media, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially like I don't know how to
Instagram be in a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels weird to take pictures of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The front of the store and this is what's
on sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start doing some cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ordered a grow tent for the store.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can set that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to show how to work it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some stuff going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then we've got the next growers
meeting next Friday, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday the 21st.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 21st.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the day after my mama's birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy birthday, mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't listen to the podcast,
but whatever, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the thought that counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some a bunch of supply or freebies
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I got hooked up last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of little gifts last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go over cloning and
seeding in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beans and houseplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to say, I was going to say,
are you able to cloning cannabis plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could, but we could just take a
plant that looks just like cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: teach them how to do it and work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like that hydro shop, so let's not risk
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I go to get my, my gear for
cheap.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also guys, this podcast is brought to you
by our friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone asked me, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's mostly concert and festival
news and reviews is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about all the concerts that come
to Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to stuff like the string
cheese, fish, Galactic, the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound Tribe Sector Nine, the disco
biscuits, even if you're into like boombox
[SPEAKER_00]: and bass neckers, who I'm trying to think
of, that's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a fish, Grateful Dead,
reggae kind of a kid, but I check it out
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want to know when fish is coming
and what the cheese is up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treethugger.com will keep you up to
date with all of your hippie news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say, look out at the cookout
with treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you say string cheese incident,
I think of Richard Cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard Cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys haven't listened to Richard
Cheese, he does popular songs in a lounge
[SPEAKER_00]: style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some Rage Against the Machine,
all big band style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lounge Against the Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lounge Against the Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I would take this time to read
comments on Facebook or on Stitcher and
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes, but I haven't got any new
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, sorry, I got loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to the people that did leave
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to leave some comments on
iTunes and Stitcher, I will read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check out the comments on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an Instagram page, but like Jesse
said, I don't Instagram a lot because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take pictures of Jesse and me and I
can post them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, not a lot to post.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk more about... I
want to make sure I covered all the intro
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good place to leave questions
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at it every now and then,
make sure there's no... On the Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try so hard to answer all of the
questions I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they shut down... Facebook shut down
the iRegenetics Facebook page and took it
[SPEAKER_00]: from an interactive page and made it to
just a business page, which I find boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gotten a lot of spare time to
check Instagram and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really mess around that much on
those Facebook posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do check them to answer your questions,
but I don't really play there like I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of pissed me off taking my page
down like that without even talking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing grow lessons,
teaching you guys or trying to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner style teach you guys how to set up
a grow room for yourself so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten the room built.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the best places to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give you a good guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we've got a room built with lights
hanging, but we haven't hung our ballasts
[SPEAKER_00]: yet and our timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys need to catch up, I'll take a
pause and you can go listen to the two
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes before this and you can catch up
to where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pausing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you listened to those and learned a
whole shit time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really pause that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have paused longer because I need
a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, editing is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even edit these shows anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put them out the way they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way better when we're just high doing
our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got these big this big 10 by
eight by eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built an eight by eight room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your poly wrapped, we're around
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your lights hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I would like to do is show you
the, not show you, tell you the way I hang
[SPEAKER_00]: my ballasts and my electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jesse and I have a lot of different
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those will get fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a piece of plywood to mount all of
the electronics in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Lowe's or whatever hardware store,
they actually sell a pre-cut board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 24, it may be 18 inches by 36
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can screw that right onto the wall
and you can hang, I can fit four,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fit five ballasts and my power box
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the ballasts are plugged in to
the power box and it's also screwed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I screwed the board to the framing on the
outside of the grill room to keep the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse was talking about if you put it on
the inside, keep it close to the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside is ideal because if something
goes wrong, you don't have to go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep a fire extinguisher near that
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have to run into the
grill room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a smoke alarm in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a fire, you don't want to have
to go halfway through the room to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: your fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have it outside, kick the door
open and start spraying and put out fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your biggest fear, but you got to
be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got this board, you got four
ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, I put a power box on there
because that's how I plug everything in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Screws the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like those power boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy them straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made in America, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you, here's a random
side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ballasts are made in America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Google that while I read on for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's almost time for me to buy
several more ballasts and I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy American made products because I
noticed that the, what the hell brand is
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The quantums that used to be made in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they come with a made in China or a
made in Korea sticker on them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: smell funny now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I've noticed that the fans don't
last as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start shitting out really quickly
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to buy those anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those used to be my go-tos because they
don't fail like a next gen does.
[SPEAKER_00]: A next gen will just shit out on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll try to start up and fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't start properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a 400 watt next gen right
now I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to replace my 400 watt next gen
because it took a shit on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a 600 in that room now just
because I don't want to go buy that 400.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, they're kind of hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 400?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep my males under a 400 in
flower just because you can just keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and you don't need to run all
that much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just doing a pheno hunt for
boys, how many people pheno hunt for
[SPEAKER_00]: males?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pheno hunting for males,
you're probably not listening to this
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're beyond everything we've said so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be hanging out at the table
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pheno hunting for males,
you're invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just strategizing about that very
subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, can we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm iREGENETICS, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Rasta Jeff from iREGENETICS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running iREGENETICS for a couple
of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds have been available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot keep up with the demand for my
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got enough breeding space to breed
plenty of seeds, but when they go on sale
[SPEAKER_00]: at Nature's Green Remedies, they sell out
in 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our good buddy Jesse has stepped up to the
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run a bunch of his shit as
soon as it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see that his stuff does good,
we're going to add him to our lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be part of team iREGENETICS.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be another breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be our second breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tripod farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tripod farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to get him in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon, stuff that Jesse bred will be
available through the iREGENETICS catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some chem dog stuff coming and some OG
flavorful stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Halloween, I put Grateful Dog pollen on
a Platinum OG female and on a Sour Diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never pollinated those with the
Grateful Dog before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have Platinum Dog and Sour Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that same sour you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about throwing that up or
dusting him up a little too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't grow with the vigor that I
want on a heartier, thicker plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top the shit out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got good yield for a plant that
normally exhibits that trait though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flower her early because, man,
that thing takes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the hard way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't keep up with Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Gorilla Glue has tripled in size since
I started flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find me an American-made ballast?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not finding... I don't suspect the
galaxies are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Sunlight, a lot of their products
are made in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have an idea of a good
American-made ballast, let me know because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think I know of one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really expensive one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gavitas or the... No, those would be
made in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the Gavitas competitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Epaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epaps, I believe those are China.
[SPEAKER_02]: China.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are the NanoLux DEs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know those are made in China.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are Lush Whites made in America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if Lush Whites are made in
America or if they're made in China.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would suspect they're made in... I'd
really hope they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Solistek, made in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to check out, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solistek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recommended by the Cottonmouth Kings,
even.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was one of the weirdest
endorsements I ever saw in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend these ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't a breeder or somebody endorse
that shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect that maybe the...
[SPEAKER_02]: Horderlux makes ballasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe their stuff's made in
America.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to buy American-made ballasts,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to, also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take this board that I bought at
Lowe's and I put the board on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: and I mount my... I don't screw it to the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set it on the floor so I can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set the board on the floor and then I
screw the ballasts to the board and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: screw my power box to the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this board is movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang your ballast damn near
anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bolt that to where it's convenient for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's outside of the room is what I
would prefer because then you're keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: heat out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ballasts get hot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it outside of the room and then you can
mess with your timers and stuff and not be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room so that it's just easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bolt that wherever you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw that wherever you need the framing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then run that wiring through a small hole
in the poly and tape over it to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: light from leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got air in, air out,
lights and power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to need to cool down
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: An air conditioner is definitely what
you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take another small board and put your
air conditioner thermostat on there if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have one that doesn't attach to the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plug your air conditioner into a
temperature sensor and hang that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the temperature gets to a
certain thing, to the certain temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can set the day and night temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that little meter will tell the
air conditioner when to come on and when
[SPEAKER_00]: to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that with almost any piece
of equipment in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can automate your dehumidifier,
your air conditioner, you can automate
[SPEAKER_00]: your fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one room, I've got an emergency
shutdown switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it hits over 95 degrees in that room,
everything turns off, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the air conditioners, because I don't
know what's causing the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything just shuts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ambient temps are only going to be
70 something in that area anyway when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So automation, put all your automation
stuff on one board and put that where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a thermometer, a hygrometer on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff that you want to be able to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that has to be inside the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put that in the room if you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that outside of the room,
it'll be more expensive, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one will probably have to go in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just put all your stuff onto one board
and nail it to one spot up high where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A random side note, when you're building a
grow room and you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: planning a grow room, think of water goes
low, electrical goes high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your water low on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a bucket, if you got a
reservoir, there's no need to lift that up
[SPEAKER_00]: off the ground too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it low, because if it does topple
over, you don't want it to spill on your
[SPEAKER_00]: electronics, which should be kept above
waste high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't run conduit along the wall lower
than about 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually believe that's code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these guys aren't, they're just
building a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to keep water low, electricity
high, because you don't want to pour water
[SPEAKER_00]: into your electricity ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your cords organized, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many messes of grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them as short as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn this pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of tipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got impotent on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put a smoke alarm and fire detector
where you can get to the smoke alarm in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, the fire detector outside of the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are little side notes that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need air conditioning
is what I wrote down next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow the general rule of 3000 BTUs of
air conditioning per thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use those traditional ACs
you can put in the window, you can cuddle,
[SPEAKER_00]: that do go in a window, you can cut a hole
in the poly and mount the AC to the
[SPEAKER_00]: framing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's going to heat up whatever room
you dumped the AC exhaust into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a garage or an unused
basement, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't heat up like if you're...
You have to exhaust that heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go somewhere or it's just
going to continue to heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people run it straight through
the chimney if you got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it go into the attic if you need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are in illegal states,
you're going to have to plan this a little
[SPEAKER_00]: better because your heat signature is what
they're going to look for to bust you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard they have to have a warrant for
that, but I'm no lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's also 2014, almost 15,
where the cops can do just about whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are living in a police state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just fly over with that camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, oh, look, all that bright
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll just send a car to go sit
in front of your house and then they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: notice some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops are the worst gang that we have
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst criminals on the damn streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the air conditioners, if it's going to
outside, a lot of them... If the air
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioner is in your room and it's in an
outside window, the light shines through.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take a can of spray paint,
get you... I can't remember how I did it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's some way you can get a nozzle
on there that you can stick a little straw
[SPEAKER_02]: in, like WD-40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say the WD-40 straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And spray the white foam inside the vents
with black spray paint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all clean and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stops the light from coming out.
Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're putting that in the... I
picked that up from Subcool actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you... So I didn't brag about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a really sweet picture to
Instagram the other day and Subcool
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sent me a message that said we
should collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, there could be some TGA,
iri, genetic stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I'm going to focus on what
I'm doing with Jesse because I know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: for real and I know I can trust Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody else out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really honored for that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like the first person I thought of.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I had something else I wanted to say
before we got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black spray paint on the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping light out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the... And they take more
energy, but I like those air conditioners
[SPEAKER_00]: on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a little duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just duct it right out of a six
inch duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are glorious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a little more electricity,
but they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need maybe a fan speed
controller if you're... Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a reason to add a fan speed
controller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a little thermostat thing to turn
off my air cool fans when it gets too cold
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked out to the room the other day and
there's 4,000 watt lights burning and
[SPEAKER_02]: normally it's 72, 68 degrees in there and
it was like 55 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shut all the fans off, everything,
and it took most of the light cycle to
[SPEAKER_02]: heat back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving this wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was negative six degrees here the other
night where we live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cold, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My air conditioners aren't on in any of my
grows right now and I'm confident that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've turned all of the air conditioners
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saving some electricity right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of electricity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We heat with wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone through an insane amount of
firewood in the last three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably three, 400 pounds shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build your grows to where there are a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm that guy that automates as much as I
can so that I do not... Oh, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't automate any of my watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel that I need to be in
there watering the plants by hand myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I move every pot when I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull off a leaf off of almost every
plant and look at the bottom, look for a
[SPEAKER_00]: bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm anal in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a ritual that I go through in
there every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can't bug me until this is done or
everything will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to love this room, but I automate
almost everything else I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, your light cycles, your air
conditioning, your dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: your CO2, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new rules that they're trying to
propose here in Pueblo, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to ban CO2 augmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the stupid things they wrote
in the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about that more in the
future, but that just came up in my head.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo, Pueblo, Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clown shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clown shoes, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Size 55, triple E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you got your... I hope that made
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mounted the ballasts right to a
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put the board right up on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to run all the cables.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part I skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure when you push the cables
together, make sure you push them tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way tight, because when that
shit's loose, that's electricity that's
[SPEAKER_00]: live right there just being exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to design... I made them myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just bend them all up, but out of wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do a safety wire too, to hold it all
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in bands, I learned to tie
cords that are connected together in that
[SPEAKER_00]: knot, where if you pull instead,
it tightens the knot instead of them
[SPEAKER_00]: coming apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that move a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a roadie and a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 70s, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about a tip on pictures,
and since we're talking about running
[SPEAKER_02]: cords, here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cord that runs from the ballast to the
light is what causes all the bars in your
[SPEAKER_02]: picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the shorter those are, and the neater
they're hung and everything, the less bars
[SPEAKER_02]: and shit you'll have coming up on some
cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's the magnetic that causes
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think... That's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't... I didn't really care about it
when I set up my new room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you keep all the cords away
from each other too, individually,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of tied together on the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that makes sense, because
you're getting way more of that signal all
[SPEAKER_00]: at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down so much stuff on so many
different papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many different things on too many
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks way professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Howard Stern or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get sued for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like his fucking trademark,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Howard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to steal your trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was flattery is what that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this room mostly figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got lights hung.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all of our automation set up,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got air going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got air going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you've got most air, everything
set up, you've got your pond liner on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add four four by four tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use, and I don't want to say brands,
but I use the Hydrofarm four by four white
[SPEAKER_00]: flood tables because they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to raise them up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the white botanic care trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find something to make you a stand
for them or you can put them on buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tables that they sell are so damn
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy the tables that are prefabbed
unless you're looking to look like you got
[SPEAKER_00]: a pro room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just straight up HydroStore guy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those tables are bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could kick one over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say the Bigfoot table is
just stuck together with little plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: pegs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can fall over so easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I like the tables and the
trays, I like to get the plants up off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floor gets too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you lift them up off the ground,
you get a more regulated temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you can get a little more
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm six foot five, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having plants down on the ground,
I have to get on my knee to get down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil to see what's happening at the
soil level or the bottom foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lifting them up off the ground two feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right where I want them and I
don't have to squat all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that better too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to see a lot more of what's going
on too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this way more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much space you have and
how big a plant you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing seven gallon pots and
you're putting them on a table,
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're going to have a seven foot tall
plant maybe by the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to plant ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the four by four tables, you can fit
four seven gallon pots or nine or 12 three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're perfect for one light worth of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a legal state and you got the
numbers and you're going to do hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do 64, those little six inch rock
wool cubes and just put a clone in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and veg them for like a week and flower in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I've seen people pull a pound and a
half off of 64 little clones veg for a
[SPEAKER_00]: week and a half on a table like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 64 little nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weighed about seven grams each or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cali connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally how Swerve does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recipe to success or whatever he calls it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast track to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Swerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Swerve?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I haven't heard much from that guy
in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media kind of killed everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Facebook Nazi police went and made
everybody use our real names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I scroll through, I don't even
know anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except Coma.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you pull that off, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the trick, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a drag queen, and I know that's
not the appropriate word, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate word anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not politically correct in the drag
queen scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my cousin's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're a drag queen, you can
email Facebook and say, I'm a drag queen
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is my alter ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will allow you to use your fake
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably won't work anymore after a
couple of days that this show is out and
[SPEAKER_00]: people try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's worked for, that's why a lot of
the people that like in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community, handmade, they're still Richard
or they're still handmade instead of Adam
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people got to keep their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's random.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a bunch of drag queens that like to
know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all had to put their real names up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because now instead of being Simone
LaRue, it's Michael Witt.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Witt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who your dad is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should shut my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Mr. Witt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to see you at the Grover's meeting
November 21st to High-Grow indoor growing
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a random plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan's new comedy special comes out
on Comedy Central the night of the 21st at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to leave High-Grow indoor
growing supplies and I'm going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: home and I'm going to get super dabbed out
and I'm going to watch the Joe Rogan
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was there at ComedyWorks when that
shit was recorded and I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they show my high ass on that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, I might have to watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're totally off topic guys, but have fun
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were seating us for the Joe Rogan
experience or the recording of his live
[SPEAKER_00]: show and there were cameras all over
ComedyWorks and they put me and my crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was me and my date and one of our
good friends and we all had dreadlocks and
[SPEAKER_00]: they put us in about row eight where no
one can see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're like, yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they would bring in normal
looking people and set them in rows three
[SPEAKER_00]: and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if a guy came in with a good
looking girl, like there was a girl that
[SPEAKER_00]: came in and I'm not even being a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had her boobies hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was wearing like a peach colored
shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was all tan and had her hair all done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at my date and I go front row
watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got two people out of the front
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you guys have to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put her and her date front row in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just doing it for TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just pretty people up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put me under a camera so that there
was no chance of that camera getting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was cool because I was the camera
that Joe was looking directly into the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a camera like about 20 rows back
from the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only did about half the comedy club
full that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm way ranting, but I had so
much fun seeing Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stressful being in a taping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all, they ask you for your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like ComedyWorks wants to take your phone
from you so that it doesn't ring or go off
[SPEAKER_00]: during the taping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted, they wouldn't let you wear a
hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted me to cover up my I read
genetics logo on my shirt, but I didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not want logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely put the three dreadlocked
hippies out of camera site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two and a half dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're calling Adam is the half dread.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're curious, Angela, you count as a
full dread sweetie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Michael make that joke the other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, he's getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tightening up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Adam?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be listening to this show
probably Monday morning when it comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you get to go to work today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow has kind of wrecked everybody's work
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been snowing for days here,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only one with a four wheel drive
vehicle that's reliable right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been playing, uh, I'm not going to
say taxi cause I don't mind doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's been nice helping all my friends
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled a chick and her little boyfriend
out the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a gigantic truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it's not one of those diesel
fucking, uh, penile issue things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not classy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a chick getting truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a working man's damn truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can deliver soil anywhere in Pueblo or
anywhere in Colorado in that truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of Pike's Peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're driving around like Ken Block.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it is around here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just slushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like nobody's driven in the snow
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, we're going to get back
onto building a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of ranting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, if you're building a hydro hut,
that's very similar to this setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd run the ducting for the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a couple of ways to do the
lights, but I would run the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ducting straight through the hut so
that the light heat never makes it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hole on the left side and the
right side of the huts at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hang the blower inside the hut on one
side, run the ducting from the outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, over the blower, over the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that way the heat, that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just make a tunnel right through it
and the heat never actually stays inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's also a little hole in the roof
of the huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a blower there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said roof, just the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a blower there, uh, to pull fresh
air through the hut constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a carbon filter and a blower inside
the hut and fit it out of the top there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it makes the airflow pull air in from
the bottom and the heat goes out the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and always remember, always remember
that your blower can pull more air they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to push than it can push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down a lot of shitty half ass
notes right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those notes were full sentences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blowers work better when they're outside
of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same reason you never see the
fart fan in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always mounted up in the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to pull air out than it is to
push it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely easier to pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, here's a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do you run a carbon filter in tents
when you're collecting pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've, I don't because I don't
have a blower at all in my tent where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run, uh, um, when God you're,
dude, this is crazy secret shit right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a veil that's in full flower
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a genuine quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got him in his own three by three
hut with one coily CFL in there to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: him awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all because I can't create any
heat because I don't want to suck the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's just in there with the CFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a peek when we're done if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't want to, there's pollen in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need a shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've always wondered about,
I'm I'm flowering one under a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm flowering a couple under a
thousand watt right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, uh, I might be changing that
out to a different light.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, uh, although I want to see their fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, here's more shit that I don't tell
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a brown paper bag and put it right
over the top Cola and secure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, when I'm sure that I see
him, when he's nut in a whole bunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cut that sucker off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have the branch sticking out of
the bag and I'll hold it with my hand
[SPEAKER_00]: around the branch and pull the branch out
of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you pull, you knock everything off
into the bag and you just come out with a
[SPEAKER_02]: stick and then you just clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll clean out all that material
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour that onto a, I use a drum head,
actually an old drum head, flip it upside
[SPEAKER_00]: down and pour all my shit under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, but that's how I got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm going to repurpose that
shit, but, uh, so if you leave those in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hut with that bag over there with the
blower on the top, it doesn't steal a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of your pollen, but it does take some a
little bit, but you're going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also phenol hunting too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already know that male is who I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just let him sit in there and just
jizz away and collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just circle jerking or bukkake in a bag
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just pollen chucking this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This male, this is his, uh, the same male,
probably his 10th time pollinating shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone of the same male, not the same
guy, but a clone of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 10th time hitting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: My one male that, uh, are, are you already
have picked out proof of himself and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's I took clones of them the other
day and I took like 25, uh, just to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure I will only keep one, but you gotta
have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I'm excited that all the clones
I recently took, uh, they all cut or they
[SPEAKER_00]: all rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, most of the seeds I've sprouted are
all germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm working on another project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I don't know if I even want to tell
everybody this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am starting to F2 black cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the phenol hunt to find the male
and the female to F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I plan to start the flowering cycle
right at the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by March 1st ish, I should have found a
good male and a good female that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones of those will be ran next to be
bred to make, and I'll use two females and
[SPEAKER_00]: one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use a purple female and a non-purple
female and see what the progeny make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a solid purple male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to see if I, cause I may,
uh, may make it recessive if I forced too
[SPEAKER_00]: much purple into it may not come out till
the F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the two purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are paying attention to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's random shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another way that I've been setting up
these tents, um, with just one blower
[SPEAKER_00]: because it seemed, it seems efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're in a small space,
I put the five by five hut with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I do the blower on the roof outside of
the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that hole right on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just set the blower right on top of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run ducting into the hut and then around
into the light, uh, fix the light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflector and then ducting out of the
light reflector to a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the carbon filter is hung really high
in the hut as high as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're filtering the air,
pulling out humidity and cooling your
[SPEAKER_00]: light all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those work great in the garage right
now in Colorado in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a heater more than you need cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put a heater in there at night
to keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got two of those huts,
you could run them side by side and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could vent that heat into the other hut
from your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you thought about how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleeping plants emit CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you move your dark, the air from
your sleeping room into your awake room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were moving CO2 to a usable space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a definite good hint for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if mushroom bags are on that CO2
fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to keep harping on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're talking about using tanks
is what they're afraid of because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unsafe because we have to travel with
tanks and we don't have any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my argument, because I am going to go
to city council when this comes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this is available at the
hydroponics store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can the guy growing tomatoes or the
guy growing orchids or whatever else he's
[SPEAKER_00]: using, why can he have CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm a cannabis grower,
I cannot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive around with a bottle of acetylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about something fucking
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no special license.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went down to air gas and they gave it to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I signed a contract that says I wouldn't
damage their bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they cared about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ruin our container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could blow up a fricking building with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm going to, but accidentally
you could on accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: The capability lies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be the last one to ever do that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you just said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got paranoid right after you said,
I can't say that on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abort.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many more dangerous things out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, let's save this for Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, we need you back on the show here in
a week or two because you've been going to
[SPEAKER_00]: those meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad you're gone, but we need you
to come update us with what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: our community and what kind of rules are
trying to enforce on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go the other night,
but fucking weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growers have been busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the night it got shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of chilly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, it's snowing instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was wearing shorts that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a 60 degrees and within an
hour it was just fucking damn near
[SPEAKER_02]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus six was cold the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was driving home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice and cold at minus six.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fricking cold right now, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was coming out and coming down like
crazy out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're prepared, the first few,
I'm from California, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first moved here, winter killed me
and now I don't get, I'm going to knock on
[SPEAKER_00]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get sick like I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first moved here, I'd get terribly
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every winter, just because I didn't know
what to do with minus six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you even dress for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to dress like it's Antarctica to
get to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get to school,
it's 77 in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're sweating your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn how to adjust without
getting sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Durango, so I've been used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living in Pueblo softened me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: These generations are getting softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go, we were talking about a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our good buddy, Spence had his appendix
removed and Jesse was kind enough to post
[SPEAKER_00]: a meme of a doctor removing his own damn
appendix on Spencer's Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this generation, I don't know how many
people would just reach down and remove
[SPEAKER_00]: their own appendix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're too entitled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't somebody else do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, if you have more questions about a
hydro hut, I'm pretty good at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a question, I can set up your
hydro hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you a lot of advice on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bracing, sometimes these hoods and you get
a carbon filter and a blower and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything hung up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy ways to brace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go buy some PVC and just freaking tape it
really tight or tie it to the other roof
[SPEAKER_02]: beams.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll help give you a little structure
up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen someone screw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a four by four hut, so they took
a four by four piece plywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: They screwed it to the roof on the outside
and that really, really strengthened that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude could have stood on the top of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a little rickety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little wobbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're putting a heavy, if you don't
have the right carbon filter, the good
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filters are heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell lighter ones that are more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that one, putting a lot
of weight up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A light is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hanging a triple XL Raptor,
that's some heavy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably don't need one of those in a
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hint, just a little, you know,
hint there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eight inch sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun, stars, snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly which reflectors I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Radiant Sixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Radiant Six or the Radiant Eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the size of a shoe box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think instead of a big wide reflector,
a little reflector is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a sexual joke out of this if
you want, but I want it to go deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it so wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my light to penetrate the canopy a
little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say you get better
penetration that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need you tearing it apart so wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still, I mean, you got a thousand
watts is a thousand watts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your reflector is spreading it out
to a five by five area or you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: reflector spreading it out to a three by
three area, which, you know, reflector,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get a better value for
that thousand watts from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, it's going to be the
three by three every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those huts, those huts are very
well made with that reflective material in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I get a lot more lumens out of
those huts than I do the open rooms that I
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take better pictures too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sure, they got that sexy background
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of this is the same if you're
working in a bedroom or a closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: just on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't cut holes for ducting,
try using a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of talked about tricking you on
the windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, use some of that blue foam
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I think it's for insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got it at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut that to size, pop that in your window
with some duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to cut holes out of that,
I take, actually I use a pre-made six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: or eight inch flange that's used for a
blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I set that on that blue foam board and
I just step on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I cut holes in my foam
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect sizes for my ducks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your shoe on and step on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then she'll cut the piss off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to, you got to knock that
out cause it gets stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to use something to punch it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a nice little, uh, life hack is
the popular new term on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to cut, just be lazy and
stomp it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always use a drywall saw and make a
gigantic mess everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blue, when you cut that blue foam
board, it's going to make a gigantic foamy
[SPEAKER_00]: mess everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll clog up your saws like nothing
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disguise your out ducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you can duct it out of the attic or
a chimney, uh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't want your neighbors seeing
it's minus six outside right now for my
[SPEAKER_00]: heat is dumping outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's making steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter, even if it's, even if it's 20
degrees, it'll probably make steam dumping
[SPEAKER_00]: into minus six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can see your air coming out of
your grow space at 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, melting snow off the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy in another neighborhood
that a friend of mine and I used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: fun of because every morning at seven o
'clock, you could see the blower click in
[SPEAKER_00]: and the one section would clear from the
stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about 30 minutes later,
one side of the roof would be all clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where his grow space is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it in the attic right up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got all your automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've got everything ducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got lights going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, it's almost time to add plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say get everything set up,
run the room, uh, set all of your timers
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a cycle or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your air conditioner kicks in
when it gets too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the lights go off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: As planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pay attention to the temps and
humidity without the plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the time to make corrections.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to also keep in mind,
um, an empty room runs hotter than a room
[SPEAKER_02]: full of plants and plants absorb heat and
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will also be less humid without
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I put plants in the plants are
going to cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you have a guess if I were running
this eight by eight room, how many degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants are going to drop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's completely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought he may have done more
thought on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed it, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also know that when I'm in there,
I heat the room up ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've really noticed it mostly on
tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'd say actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed it on gigantic rooms too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, it varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's at least a couple of degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can hold a shit ton of heat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, uh, and reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the whole heat to a water
reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we heat greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I've seen you guys put
big jugs of water in the sun and then
[SPEAKER_00]: hauling into the greenhouse at night to
keep them warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friend Ryan actually was heating
bricks in his oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would put a big, uh, like a pot of
bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was just making a pot roast full
of bricks and you'd heat those up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: go outside and cover the plants in a tarp
and then put the hot bricks underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just harvested like a week ago in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of all these, uh, cold weathers,
um, weathers.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, let's go down to Walmarts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, my greenhouse, I harvested all the
plants right before it got freezing cold
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, I had a couple of containers
with lettuce and spinach and radish and
[SPEAKER_02]: onions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'm super stoked that,
uh, with my little tiny heater,
[SPEAKER_02]: my little greenhouse, uh, the spinach made
it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did some of the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, everything else is frozen,
fucking dead, but frozen vegetables
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, we're getting 50 minutes
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, run your rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Run the rooms, run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once everything is cool,
then you can put plants in there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to make a couple of
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're just vegging, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tweak around with your rooms while
you're vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to piss the plants off
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you start flower, you have to
be really, really careful with your photo
[SPEAKER_00]: periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start saying photo period
all the time and leave out the word light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles because photo period is appropriate
and proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you interrupt your photo period on
a flowering plant, uh, it will possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: revert back to veg and it will probably
hermaphrodite and you're running a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of making some seeds out of that on
accident that you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't, don't mess with your photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave the seeds to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a good breeding project,
keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I used to be really kind of secretive
and I didn't like to share my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: information because I feel like I'll teach
you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But breeding, you got to get a good grasp
on breed on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you've got that, then you'll kind
of learn how to breed with that on
[SPEAKER_00]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I kind of been sharing a little
bit of my breeding secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys have a specific question,
I'd rather help you than just watch you
[SPEAKER_00]: fail is how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not help you do it right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first got started, I won't mention
any names, but I hit up a couple of guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, just with some basic
questions and I got told to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck off basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, always kind of disheartened me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it also encouraged me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, screw these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just taking a little time to research
stuff and read it on your own goes a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet is great, but, and I've been
banned from so many forums and chat rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: because the internet is full of shit and
people will type whatever they want
[SPEAKER_00]: without knowing what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel that that sucks because it
causes problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what inspired this show was
reading shit on the internet, going,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, I hope nobody tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually seeing somebody ask his
friend a question on a forum that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like troll it up, but it's not troll it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been banned, so I want to advertise
the site, but on troll it up, somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: asked a question and the guy replied with
a totally bullshit answer to his friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, don't your friend just
killed your whole crop, however many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you have, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of what inspired me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what inspired this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get people that know what
they're doing to come and put a good voice
[SPEAKER_00]: out for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a, um, a thing on the probiotics
farmers Alliance, uh, a pin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the very first post if you ever join
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I can't quote it for verbatim,
but by any means, but, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it just says essentially,
you know, don't make something back just
[SPEAKER_02]: because you believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't really, uh, recreate it,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, um, there's so much
shit out there and people just type shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and they believe it and they're full of
shit themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what worked for them may not work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your situation could be totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm a member of that group
anymore, so I won't be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to leave that group because they put
up too much stuff and I got way too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a great place, but yeah,
there's not in the group, so I can't view
[SPEAKER_00]: their stuff, but still good group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of the gauge green genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those, those guys are man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sharing incredible knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an incredible genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff gauge green has been putting out
lately is super impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually breed with a gauge green
genetics, daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how much I liked that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made my own F2 daybreaker male to use
so that I don't have to use gauges
[SPEAKER_00]: original working to have my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam was here the other night and I cut
down nine daybreakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hold this trash bag open for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was chop, chop, chop, chop,
chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just went, oh, he told me I made
him sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, my heart's broken, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last spring I had a plant that got some
mold and I didn't notice it till we were
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw him through the fricking thing
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy that was helping me trim,
I'm pretty sure he wanted to go take
[SPEAKER_02]: through the trash can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just threw it in dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, I'm not, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your situation, I had a white rhino
plant that had to be five ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top cola was as big as a football.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the size of the skaterade bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this season of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of cold in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that plant, I know it
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept checking it and nothing,
kept checking it and nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At harvest time, the center of one bud had
mildew all up the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw the whole plant away because I
didn't want to go fish through every bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my trimmer buddy, Mike, it was Mike at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just kind of new friends at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put a trash bag over it and threw
it all away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, the whole thing,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, we can't mess with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference between a pot farmer
and a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing medical weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that would have sold that is
just growing shitty weed for money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then also, I mean, yeah,
there's just so many reasons to throw it
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to keep a moldy plant
around my house to spread mold spores even
[SPEAKER_02]: more and just, you know, just screw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some pride in what you do,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working really hard at growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make people sicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make people feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we went over a whole bunch of
information in kind of a scattered way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your plants off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your plants off the ground,
especially in this cold weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep everything off the concrete floor you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your nutrients, your water
reservoir, clone trays most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're running an easy cloner and
you need that cool water.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, but if you figure that
out, you know, you're probably one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those guys that's just getting
entertainment here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to we're going to definitely
get more advanced as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 40 episodes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are learning stuff now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning stuff now because I have to
read just to make sure I don't lie to you
[SPEAKER_00]: because I made a mistake on the show one
time and I felt really stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go teaching wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely had to come back and correct
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been making sure to read
everything and stay on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading more about nutrients because I
know about nutrients, but you get so
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable that you don't even pay
attention anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I know when I look at that
plant, that's a phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to give it some phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to kind of brush up a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to do a little homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be doing that anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, with my profession,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those times when you're sitting there in
the store, ready to pull your beard out,
[SPEAKER_00]: just grab a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the Internet there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've got a actually got a couple of
books down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydrofarm sent us a free book for
employees and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our other employees is reading it
right now, but I can't wait to go over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about indoor hydroproduct
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not pot specific or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow rooms are grow rooms.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydrofarm is afraid of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how you have to hold back on that
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever really want to know my view on
that, come see me at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to several other hydro shop
owners and you guys all seem to agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody feels the same about Sunlight
and Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our customers built a, I'll say this,
our customers built them a hell of a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's about time to wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for almost an hour here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, you got anybody to shout out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody to say thanks to anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone down at the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good experience in there today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me think of a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've been digging on some SFVOG
lately, big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when do I get my cut of that SFVOG?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought she already had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I had to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cut I've been told.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know where yours came from and
they don't want me to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a breeder, dude, people don't want
you to have their cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cut of SFV has made a lot of great
strains and I think we're going to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee we'll make a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap up
