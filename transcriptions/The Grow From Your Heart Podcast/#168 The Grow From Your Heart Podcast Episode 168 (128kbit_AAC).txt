[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 168 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friend, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends and the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody's having a great day
while they're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not put out a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to kind of hang out for a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually recording the day after
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everybody had a good holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everybody survived Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you boycotted Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you did, hope it went well for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about 45 minutes ago, I ate a
Schummit bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate a Schummit banana pudding bar made
with 200 milligrams of THC distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, caution, it contains medical
marijuana for medical use only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep out of reach of children.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see why, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 40 minutes ago, my life was
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting high as shit from this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decided I better get down on this
recording and get it done before things
[SPEAKER_01]: get wonky in my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to our friends at
Schummit bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I endorse the banana pudding bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get yourself one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out at your local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, speaking of shout
out, big shout out to our friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need regular or feminized seeds,
make sure you support our friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was English.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got brands like Archive Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have got Mile High, Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've, of course, got Irene Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got Rare Dankness.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got everybody you can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've now got Brothers Grimm Seeds,
which is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Brothers Grimm and the
C99.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check out thedankteam
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, who else do I need to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give a shout out to, no more shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're talking about seeds,
let's talk about my recent breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday, I checked the male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I checked the female plants, and they were
speaking at me, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, it is time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's sprinkle some pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's been paying attention to
the show knows that I have been running a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding project continuously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always got some breeding going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, I've got a male Arise
plant, and I've got some female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got a Grateful Dog female.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Lemon Jeffrey female.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several Cookies and Cream
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's White Widow, and there are some
other things in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There also are Rises in there,
so I can make some Arise have two seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of stuff in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yesterday, the male plants are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are male colas the length of my arms
on these male plants, and pollen is just
[SPEAKER_01]: falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you breathe too heavily, pollen goes
flying across the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want to drag the whole plant
across the room to where the females were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cut off a few select branches that
were quite large, carried them over,
[SPEAKER_01]: moved them over to the female plants,
and gave all those male plants a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge cloud of pollen in my
grow room for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taste like pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything tastes like pollen around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole mouth was just coated in pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to take a fat shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of pollen in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in about 50, 60-ish days, we're going
to have some new seeds, some new
[SPEAKER_01]: creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some great stuff
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else can I talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just making... I've got a checklist,
you guys, because I get stupid high and
[SPEAKER_01]: forget to talk about shit and then talk
about shit that doesn't even matter
[SPEAKER_01]: instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to brag.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of days ago on Friday night,
I got to take my lovely date, Jenny Beth,
[SPEAKER_01]: to ComedyWorks to go see... Joe Rogan was
the headliner.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a comedian named Jaron Horton
that opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'd never heard of or seen him
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he came on stage, he walked in,
made a presence, and he crushed for like
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 or 40 solid minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he wound down and he looked at
the crowd and he was like, I think I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, ladies and gentlemen,
Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joe Rogan came out and crushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, Joe Rogan just did his new
comedy special for the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when a comedian records their special,
the way they do it, they kind of record
[SPEAKER_01]: that special and they throw away that
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once your comedy special comes out on
Comedy Central or Netflix or wherever it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes, CISO seems to be the new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once your comedy special comes out,
you throw away that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't perform that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you work on your next hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the year,
you want to put out your whole new
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you do that all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that keeps the comedian on his toes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rogan just put out a special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's only had a couple of months to
work up new shit, maybe a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was here doing new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went for an hour and a half and about
45 to an hour into the show, he kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: looked up at the crowd with this look and
he goes, I just ran out of shit about like
[SPEAKER_01]: three minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any more material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just started making shit up on the
fly and kind of joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he still crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a little bit of crowd work,
but he destroyed for a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Joe Rogan style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way he does comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with like 97% of what he says.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joe does his show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're giving him a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He walks off the stage and less than 40
seconds later, he comes running back on
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to be like 15, 20 seconds later.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ran back on stage and he grabs a
microphone and he said, sit the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, Dave Chappelle is
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or he said, you guys, Dave Chappelle is
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me and my date looked at each other
like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what probably one of our
favorite comedians, both of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen Dave Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's never seen Rogan or Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Rogan before, but for Chappelle
to walk out was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chappelle was fucked up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chappelle was intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, since I've got some friends at
ComedyWorks, I happen to be front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you walk out onto the stage,
there are a couple of stages, a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: seats actually on the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you go a few more feet,
those next two seats that are in the crowd
[SPEAKER_01]: are where I was sitting and where Jenny
Beth was sitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chappelle just was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he just walked out barely onto the
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was on the stage and he stood
directly in front of her and I and told
[SPEAKER_01]: jokes for about 30 minutes and chain
smoked cigarettes and drank Corona beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did 40 solid minutes of grabbing by the
pussy jokes and material about Trump and
[SPEAKER_01]: the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did some Dave Chappelle jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a little bit of weed jokes,
but mostly grabbing by the pussy jokes for
[SPEAKER_01]: like 40 minutes by Dave Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jenny Beth for going with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was an incredible date.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been having a lot of fun with her
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad she was able to come and to get her
off work a little bit early for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super huge shout out to the fucking
traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I-25 can lick my balls,
but that night it was smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything went super smooth that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Baker at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the entire ComedyWorks
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: ComedyWorks has a podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called How Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you care about comedy, if you're a
comedy fan, I of course am obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How Comedy Works hosted by Wendy,
the owner of ComedyWorks and a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Rick Kearns.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's almost famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's kind of on the cusp there,
but he's really funny and he's got a great
[SPEAKER_01]: personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where else are we on this list of things
to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give one more shout out and then
we're going to do a couple things here
[SPEAKER_01]: with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some real content, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe a shout out to my friend at The
Spliffcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, there's a podcast
called The Spliffcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me, she gave me like a minute
and a half shout out and an endorsement
[SPEAKER_01]: the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I listened to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody told me, hey, this podcast
shouted you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I checked it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, that's a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hosted by a lady named Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not as hyper as me and she doesn't
take as many dabs as me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's a little, little more focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm too much energy for you,
if I'm too hyper and spastic, you will
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely enjoy her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's more mellow than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she puts out a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I endorsed that fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys support my new friend at The
Spliffcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to open up iTunes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of new iTunes comments,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the iTunes comments and the
reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate it if you go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an iTunes user, if you've got an
iPhone, if you've got a Mac book,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, however you're using iTunes,
a lot of you guys are using an Android
[SPEAKER_01]: with Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got iTunes, go to the iTunes
store, search for the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you find, you got to scroll down to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little tab with the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the red, golden green logo with
my face on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that, go to ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be super awesome if you typed in
a rating, a review, and then gave me a
[SPEAKER_01]: rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody so far has given me a five star
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got 39 five star reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be cool if you kept that up,
but hey, give me what you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read the two most recent
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just happens to be from Bo at The
Spliff Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, she said, one episode in and I
can tell this show is solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait for the new ones and to go
digging through old ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't grow, but in theory, and you got
all kinds of delivery on the theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you for listening to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great hearing other podcast
podcasters compliment your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the compliments mean a lot to me,
but she complimented on her show.
[SPEAKER_01]: She complimented the sound quality other
than me clearing my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She complimented the sound quality and
that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for noticing the show overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shot at the Bo at The Spliff
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next comment comes from Dab Smiths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab Smiths has become a good friend
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The comment says, oh, I got a five star
review also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the comment says great show is always
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should try to do two shows a week on
the reg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the good podcast to listen to
every Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I start the daily grind, I usually
get the show while I'm prepping my work
[SPEAKER_01]: for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work, amigo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wish I could do, I wish I
could promise you two shows every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes time doesn't allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week, of course, being the
Thanksgiving week, I just took it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hang out, spend some time,
actually worked on my garden a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hung out with that girl, Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking about so much,
hung out with some family, hung out with
[SPEAKER_01]: my kiddo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk about her a lot on the
podcast because, I mean, she doesn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be talked about, I'm pretty sure,
on a podcast, but hung out with her a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of took the Thursday episode
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you a Monday episode and I will
do my best to get you Thursday episodes as
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that I can make your Mondays
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was why I put them out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mondays are generally shitty for people
who don't like their jobs or don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the best jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that don't get to grow weed,
people that aren't artists or musicians,
[SPEAKER_01]: your Monday probably sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the service industry,
your Monday sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I put them out on Monday
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to make your day a little bit
brighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I'm doing that for you,
DabSmiths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I would love your comments or if
you've got something else you'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: say and you don't want to say it on a
public forum, you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would totally love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of emails, you guys, that's where
we're going to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an email from a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'm going to hit pause and take a
drink so I can quit clearing my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on for just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even have to hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll happen through editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I feel like that's a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it'll come back because I took
some dabs and I ate this, I'm not blaming
[SPEAKER_01]: it on the banana pudding bar, but it is
kind of making my throat a little,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's getting rid of that buttery thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, let's get to this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start it off with an email from a
dude who said, call him Roscoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, hey dude, it's Roscoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I messaged you for advice, which I got
from you, from your episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I catch up every Monday at work on your
podcast and have done so for over a year
[SPEAKER_01]: now when I came across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, dude, it was around that time you
said you'd put money in a pot for your
[SPEAKER_01]: curse words.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, a long time ago, I didn't
find it very professional to use any
[SPEAKER_01]: profanity on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I would drop F bombs and other
words, I would try to throw, I forgot how
[SPEAKER_01]: much money I said I would put in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually donated that to a good
cause, but I filled up a jar with a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of money, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody was like, that's stupid,
be yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it when you try to restrain
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I decided you're right,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I say fuck on the show because
it's more me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more comfortable and I hate trying to
censor myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how I, I don't know, maybe it's not
professional, but that's how I roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather be me than not to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he continues to say, anyway,
safe to say due to your podcast and the
[SPEAKER_01]: educated guests you have on, I have
successfully grown a lot of nice bushy
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also says I've saved a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, not buying from the local riff
raff has been a weight lifted off of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I've been thinking for a year now
about doing a podcast much similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: yours, bar a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I don't think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that I've saved him money and a
big hassle not having to buy from the
[SPEAKER_01]: local riff raff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm six foot five and 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't worry a lot when I used to
have to go buy cannabis, but I can only
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine if I were not this stature and I
didn't have this type of upbringing where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to go into my old neighborhood
where I'm actually from to go buy weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just imagine how that would feel
to be some of those people in the stress
[SPEAKER_01]: that that would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure people get robbed and beat up and
shit and get sold terrible product that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't even weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure I could lift a lot of weight
off people's shoulders if they're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, I can only imagine that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just thinking about the people you can
avoid by not having to buy herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambly today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to blame it on the 200 milligram
Schumet bar that I ate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many ounces of this is like 16 ounces
of Dr. Pepper together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, that's a combo you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be feeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I've been thinking about doing a,
I've been thinking for over a year now
[SPEAKER_01]: about doing a podcast much similar to you,
similar to yours bar a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he says, I am in the UK and there's
not really a podcast out here for the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have inspired me to want to be
that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law is changing slowly here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NHS are testing it for the first time
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the MPs want to advise our new
prime minister, Mr. May to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of amazing stuff in that one
paragraph.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've inspired somebody to want to create a
podcast for their, for their, the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the entire UK about cannabis,
because there isn't one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am that I'm honored that I inspired
somebody to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm glad that I inspired you to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's going to lead me to part of my
reply to your email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also great that the law is slowly
changing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some areas in the UK have really
strict, shitty cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that they're easing up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that the MPs want to advise the
minister that they want them to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when I'm pretty sure that's the
military police.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't research that, but whoever,
when other, when other people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, do this, that's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy goes on to say, I want to
educate people and teach them how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: small secret setups and have fun doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: UK cannabis news, culture, education,
chats, and more, if not illegal to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think it's illegal to
encourage on a podcast, but where you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may want to talk to a lawyer,
because I don't know the rules in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told that I'm safe as long as
I'm careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to be careful here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so check on that yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best I could say there,
but you go on to say, could you give me
[SPEAKER_01]: any advice on doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any tips, tricks, et cetera, to a
successful, successful podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, thanks dude, much love
Roscoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he also said, PS don't mind if
you read it on your podcast, which is good
[SPEAKER_01]: because I just read the whole email on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, I'm glad that I can inspire you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do a podcast about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third, thanks for being so passionate
about cannabis because it sounds like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal there and you're risking your life
and your safety and your family and your
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom and your finances and your future
for this plant because you're in love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for being on this team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that leads me to my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My part of my reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I know that you're the right person to
do this podcast because you have taken the
[SPEAKER_01]: effort to reach out to me to say,
what should I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that tells me right there, you are
supposed to be the guy doing this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be the confident, dude that you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when you go to make your podcast,
talk to the people just like you did to me
[SPEAKER_01]: in this email, cause this is comfortable
and it sounds like you're a cool person
[SPEAKER_01]: and it sounds like you can connect with
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do that on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best advice I can give to any
person trying to do any podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're fake, your listeners will
know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't have any fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't feel good and you'll come across
fake and people can spot fake and they
[SPEAKER_01]: won't listen to fake and you'll get more
shitty emails than you could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be yourself, uh, edit a little bit,
but don't take out all of your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I stutter, I say dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say the wrong shit and I talk over
myself all the time, but that's me and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned to accept me and it makes a
good podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being me.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want me to be appalled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the president.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to come out here,
up here and speak some perfect shit to you
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching how to grow weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be yourself, be comfortable,
uh, get some good equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I really should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to spend a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite setup is the Zoom H6 on the
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a Zoom H6 and I run four Sennheiser
835 E835 microphones into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what's available in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably get that or very
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's a great recording device.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for my big setup, there's a lot of
stuff happening, but sound quality is
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, if, when people do phone calls on
a podcast or if they Skype in,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd really stress on good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound the best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that there's no funky noise in
the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're going to do it in a coffee
shop and you want that clunky like dishes
[SPEAKER_01]: and waitress sound vibe kind of thing,
go for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's your vibe, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk there, when I don't talk,
there's no noise in my background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that sort of feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sound how you want to sound,
achieve your sound, figure out how you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be yourself and then find content that
relates to the audience you want to hit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is obviously cannabis and news and
culture and education and chats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find some people in your community that
you can get on a show and build a
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I found is the people that come back
to my show, the third and fourth time they
[SPEAKER_01]: come back, they forget they're on a
podcast and they're now hanging out in my
[SPEAKER_01]: little recording space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just happen to have headphones and
a microphone on, and we really get talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis in a way that we love
instead of a way that feels podcasty and
[SPEAKER_01]: interviewee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you guys notice when Jesse comes
back, the first time Jesse was here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys, a hundred episodes, Jesse talked
like this, like said like four words,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when Jesse comes on, you can't get
him to shut up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just get, kind of build a relationship
with somebody that you can get on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to find people that are experts in
certain areas of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got a guy, Jesse's my outdoor
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Sean is kind of the organics
guy, even though he's hard to get ahold of
[SPEAKER_01]: lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer was our extracts guy, even though
he's moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to have guys that you can have like
specialized, like you got guys for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a weed guy, you know, you got a
fireworks guy, you got a whatever guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: get those guys for your podcast also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something I could recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something that I could talk about
from being a podcast nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be noticed in iTunes,
get at least eight or 10 episodes put
[SPEAKER_01]: together before you launch into iTunes
because your first eight weeks in iTunes
[SPEAKER_01]: is when they will notice you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's if you get good ratings and you
pop out with a lot of quality content,
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes will put you in the new and
noteworthy category, which will get you a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more views and or listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to get eight episodes put together,
drop a lot of quality content in eight
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks and you'll get up there in iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like another guy that I listen to,
you guys, a lot of what I've learned on
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasting, I got to give somebody a shout
out here because I feel like I just
[SPEAKER_01]: turned, I channeled this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy named Cliff Ravenscraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was known, he is known as the podcast
answer man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to thepodcastanswerman.com,
Cliff will teach you a lot of stuff about
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of paid content on his
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will want you to sign up for his
podcasting A to Z courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll try to get you to pay for a lot of
online courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not paid for anything and I have
learned a tremendous amount about
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasting just through Cliff
Ravenscraft's free stuff, through his
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter feeds, through his email groups,
just stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can always contact Cliff
Ravenscraft or podcastanswerman.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a wealth of podcasting knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rosco, I feel like I have given you a
lot of podcasting information and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to try to wrangle my
listeners back up and I'm going to read an
[SPEAKER_01]: email about cannabis next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosco, I truly appreciate your efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how your podcast goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do get this podcast launched or if
you need any help getting this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: launched, send me another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be truly delighted to help you get
your podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you all the advice I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are going to be a little bit
different because you're in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the setup may be different,
but we'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the two of us, we're smart enough
to get this going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to hear your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also thanks for listening and thanks
for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to hearing your show in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put it off because if you keep
putting it off, it'll just fall to the
[SPEAKER_01]: wayside and you'll forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I need to take a
quick drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to read another email about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I got a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm ready to read another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to say your name,
dude, but big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you for sending an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will read your message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey bro, loving the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been listening for over a year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I want to thank you for spreading
the knowledge and being a voice for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, I guess I'm glad to be that voice
for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm just the guy that grabbed a
mic and wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it'll put too much pressure on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he goes on and he says,
My question I hope you can give your
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts on is a term known as bud
washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a good friend telling me to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case you're unfamiliar with the term,
it's where you take your just harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: buds that are still on the branches and
you dip or wash them in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read it's supposed to get dust particles
off of your herb and make it cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastier smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he also says, Thanks for turning me
on to Richie Spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you mentioning him on a previous
episode, so I searched him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he quotes some Richie Spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you're glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you like Richie Spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he goes, I'm high as shit tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shoe mitt bar is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate this an hour and a half ish ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'm floating around on my chair
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 milligrams of THC distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I've had a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to kind of talk about what he
asked here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said is bud washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A term that I am familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I learned this from Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge didn't do it with just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge took a five gallon bucket of,
he used reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use water from the hose if your
water is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have funky ass water,
you can use water from your hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill up a five gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Jorge was putting 25,
I've seen people put more you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: but 25 is probably what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 or 30 milliliters of 30% hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into a five gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the hydrogen peroxide that your mom's
got in the cabinet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that you buy, you can get it at
the hydro store probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it online, but it's 30%,
maybe 33, maybe 35% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not expensive, but you put about 30
milliliters of that, 25, 30 mills in a
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stir it up real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you harvest the branches and you
leave as like kind of long branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, six to eight inch long branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wear rubber gloves and dunk the entire
branch into the water and give it a swirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like freshly chopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to chop the plants down,
cut off all the big leaves, trim it up
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're going to trim it up again
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're just cleaning it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not manicuring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just kind of trimming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then dunk that into the water solution,
the peroxide water solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a good swirl so that if there is
perhaps powdery mildew on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can knock that powdery mildew off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really good way to get powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the PM on there,
I guess that would knock dust off if you
[SPEAKER_01]: grew it outside and it got dusty and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see how much dust is really
going to be on your plants if you grew
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors in a good grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard of this being done by Jorge
Cervantes and I've seen it done by other
[SPEAKER_01]: people for powdery mildew and other
problems like that to clean that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of peroxide, 25 to 30
mills in a five gallon bucket of clean
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut the branches into six or eight inch,
maybe 10 inch sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to fit in that five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunk it in there, give it a good shake,
then hang it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the buds plenty of space when they're
hung up when they're that wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just going to drip onto the
floor, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that water is going to drip all over
the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just going to run right out and
then it'll dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep a fan in the room, maybe a
dehumidifier in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the conditions in your
drying area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to do this,
you got to pay attention and don't let it
[SPEAKER_01]: get too humid in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of people are going to say,
you're going to soak buds that were just
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you think about it,
cannabis plants grow outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it weren't for us getting in the
way, they would get wet all the damn time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that every cannabis plant
that ever got wet outside got destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that a lot of them got
stronger and they got tougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the shape of a cannabis
plant, it is kind of shaped like an
[SPEAKER_01]: umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: When water hits a cannabis plant,
the leaves push the water in an outward
[SPEAKER_01]: direction and it spreads it out so that it
falls down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that tells me that you should water
the plants around that area because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the roots are going to grow out
because in nature, that's where the
[SPEAKER_01]: water's going to land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you want to get it into the
stock, but the outward area is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more where you want it because nature
would spread it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is going to search for roots
out that way because it knows that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the resin glands on your plant will
protect it from the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to bust that off by just
giving it a little dunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to come off there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys that make hash, they're using a
washing machine and ice to pull those
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes off of your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of a dunk isn't going to
pull those off of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've already got a little bit of PM
or if you had an issue, this is a good way
[SPEAKER_01]: to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because in Colorado,
I make the joke that nobody gets powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew anymore ever since anybody invented
or figured out how to make BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody just fucking blasts it,
even though it's got powdery mildew on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't recommend using a whole...
If it's got a lot of powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that product, get rid of that
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've just got a little bit of a
problem, like people in Oregon this year
[SPEAKER_01]: got pummeled with powdery mildew and other
molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will not handle your brown mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will not handle shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a little bit of powdery mildew,
this peroxide solution will get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can do it if you want to get the
dust and the dirt off if you grew outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people find cocoons or
caterpillar silk on their buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a good way to get rid of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it a good dunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you know it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure you're getting plenty of
ventilation, plenty of airflow when it
[SPEAKER_01]: dries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to dry up like normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to take a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure you can take a bud that
did not get dunked and a bud that did get
[SPEAKER_01]: dunked and dried properly and trimmed and
cured properly and you can smoke them
[SPEAKER_01]: both, then you will not be able to tell
the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I have heard of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it in practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I have personally tried
it, but I've seen it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been places that have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a semi-common practice in
commercial grows, to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is legal in Colorado to do
that, two buds grown in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I've got time for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to start another email
because I've been going for close to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes and it's hard to do a long episode
by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I just start chattering and
get way off course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start wrapping up the
show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to let you guys know about a
website known as Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys feel like you want to
contribute to the podcast, Patreon is the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, a lot of people have sent me a
message like, hey, on the website,
[SPEAKER_01]: you used to have a donation button and
that is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: PayPal did not like having their service
attached to my website that was about a
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast that was about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They felt like that was inappropriate and
they didn't want to be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they made me take the PayPal link off
of my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we can do, we can set you up with
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pull up the website right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it stored so that I can make sure
to give you the right link.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Patreon, P-A-T-R-E-O-N, Patreon.com
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go there, you can find out how to
become a member of Patreon, how you can
[SPEAKER_01]: sign up and you can contribute to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sign up and you can contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a monthly service.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to contribute monthly,
you can throw as little as one dollar in
[SPEAKER_01]: every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would totally appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you guys, what that is going for
is it will pay for the web hosting for my
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read geneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does cost me a little bit of money to
keep that running on a yearly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to pay that fee and that's what
keeps the grow from your heart podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: feed alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I'm asking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to get rich off the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to offset the costs of my
web fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already bought the equipment,
sometimes ship breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'll ask on Patreon for help with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, I'm just trying to pay for the
cost of the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate it if you contributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to quit begging because it
already feels a little funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, I want to thank you guys
for listening to another episode of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Baker at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a shout out to Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a huge shout out to everybody at
ComedyWorks who always treats me like a
[SPEAKER_01]: king every time I go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you
again that I would appreciate it if you go
[SPEAKER_01]: to iTunes, click on the iTunes store,
search for the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's my face on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the ratings and review section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type in a rating or no, type in a review.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
