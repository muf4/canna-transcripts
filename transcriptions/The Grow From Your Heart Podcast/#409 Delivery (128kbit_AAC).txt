[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 409 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon elite seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to add fresh genetics to your
garden and you can get them at Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: elite seeds dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to
welcome to the show an international
[SPEAKER_00]: traveler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome home, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking time home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You you look and sound like you've been on
the road for way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks like it could be the nap
from your heart podcast over on that side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it I've been in France for the last
10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just got back yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 24 hours of straight travel when we
landed at DIA and then drove home down to
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, all of the stories you have told
sounded amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you topped it off with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounded grueling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the trip was amazing, but the ride
home was pretty brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's sounds like a terrible,
terrible ride, but worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so so worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to talk too much about
France, but I'm glad you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us one cool thing about France since
we got you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to go too deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't don't listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I like is unless you're directly
intruding on someone like poking them with
[SPEAKER_01]: your finger, they don't care what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like pretty much anything goes
everywhere, which is really nice in our
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you mentioned several times
without any prompting was you can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere there and you're a cigarette
smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like outside, there's a lot of
non-smoking inside spaces and like you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't smoke in the museums and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, hopefully every outdoor cafe has
ashtrays on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people smoking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, for you, not for guys like me
that are grossed out by cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, but yeah, it's, it's part of
the, I don't care what you're doing to
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way it should be other than me
having to smell your damn cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to have to smell my
reefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads me into my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can edit anything out if we need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any cannabis experience in
your journey?
[SPEAKER_01]: The every time we are the first three
times, I should say it's kind of teepered
[SPEAKER_01]: off after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first three times we mentioned
that we were from Colorado, the person we
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned it to went weeds legal there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kid that was selling Nutella waffles,
like these bomb ass fucking fresh waffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just slather them with
Nutella and you eat it like they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: hot dog vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically was like, my shift ends in a
couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to score, like I'll hook you
up with good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't want to hang out for a couple of
hours and buy weed by from some kid by a
[SPEAKER_01]: tourist attraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Nutella or Nutella?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it both depending on how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how I am treated with
viola and viola extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wrong wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just say it how you're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I didn't try to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there doing other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't, wasn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the sobriety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took a nice little tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word I'm fishing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were there with your wife and
there's plenty of dude, I've seen your
[SPEAKER_00]: photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like there was time to
really waste smoking anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were busy and entertained the entire
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, we didn't stop the whole time
we're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're fucking exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's move forward from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it sounds like I'm just wearing you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to start the podcast off by
talking about what we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a dab of GG four batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I rolled that batter around in
some screaming tangerines, ambrosia,
[SPEAKER_00]: terps, the liquid terpy part at the bottom
of the container was leftover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just scooped that orange flavored
deliciousness up off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had a little bit of killer queen,
high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crunched that up and put a little bit
of, I call it the sprinkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, put some sprinkles up on top of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab of that and obviously it is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the mood for a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay that Mike is a half asleep over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I will keep the party moving half
asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other half is completely glazed
tolerance breaks are nice folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let Mike finish my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left a little in there toward the end
and I just passed the rig and the carb cap
[SPEAKER_00]: to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically took the leftover of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he took a little tiny,
tiny batter dab over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needed a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that gg4 batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff tastes really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I'm a big believer in tolerance
breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take one every, uh, every now and again,
folks, it'll do you good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to go nuts with a long,
a long break either five, 10 days is more
[SPEAKER_01]: than enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I talk about that on the podcast or on
Instagram live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me about a tolerance break
and I said, well, if you're a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, don't do it because you wouldn't
tell me, stop taking your diabetes or your
[SPEAKER_00]: cholesterol medication for a week so that
it works better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the things I've talked about
with people who do other herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: medications is that type of medicine works
best with breaks, not frequent breaks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you got to give your body a chance to
chance to breathe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it varies so much from person to
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, I've got a stomach thing and I
can tell I'm like, Oh, I'm going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a couple of dabs here next hour or
two, or this stomach thing is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start bugging me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if I imagine if I didn't
smoke for two full days, my stomach might
[SPEAKER_00]: just start flaring up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little problem that the,
the problem that I have band-aided for
[SPEAKER_00]: years, it may really swell up if I don't
give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, and I don't want to risk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it ain't broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I've been thinking,
but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes both things are true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like either one of these
positions is mandatory or the right
[SPEAKER_01]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting myself way off track,
but this is this, none of this is written
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all just chatter with Mike and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They most certainly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that first dab I took when you
sat down at the table with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that first one, that may have been a
medical marijuana dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one took the back pain away,
took the potential stomach issue away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second one where I put all the
crystals and shit, that was a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was purely just because I want to
be a little silly for the show and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I kind of do take a tolerance break
by only, I minimally dab some days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough to kind of keep the,
the whatever's away, a dab, a dab every
[SPEAKER_00]: few hours will keep the doctor away in my,
my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I just maintain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are days, trust me,
like the weekends or when I'm hanging out,
[SPEAKER_00]: going places or a comedy show,
those are the days when I really go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll find myself the next couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I not purposefully, but I'll kind of go a
little lighter and give myself not a
[SPEAKER_00]: planned tolerance break, but like my lungs
will say, Hey, you need to go lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my system will go, I'm saturated,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you dab so hard, you're not going
to get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my body and brain, I know that so I'll
take Monday will be a real light dab day a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the time, but Friday, Saturday and
Sunday, I sure did put it in to where I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to take that break Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body just said not today, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've been working hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, that throat burn after the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lungs are tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, I'm a firm believer in like
there's a line and if your body's hurting
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're using cannabis to treat it or
you've got a medical condition that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: treating, it takes more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your consumption to get baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you didn't have that condition,
not first bit of THC and CBD and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: else is, uh, the other cannabinoids in the
plant, they're all going to medical uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help relieve inflammation,
relieve pain, relieve, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after a certain point,
your body's like, okay, you can enjoy that
[SPEAKER_01]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've gotten what we need to start
taking care of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the herb is really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows, Oh, there's pain over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, we're going to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first it'll start with your negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're, you're already at like,
you got pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that puts you on the negative side,
you know, you're like, Oh, it'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go fix the negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll get you back to even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're even, then it'll go,
well, now it's kind of make him happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it makes you a little iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right after that, it goes,
well, now you had another dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we're going to go super
positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're like, Ooh, I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, there's just, there is that
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, the wife will ask me like,
you know, you say you're going to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: real quick, like real quick is 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, well, I hadn't smoked today
and I was hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first six hits, I didn't get
stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just for my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three after that were for my head and
it just takes a minute to take nine good
[SPEAKER_00]: ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just inhale and exhale a bunch
of dabs part of that sitting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, like I'm going to move my
notebook and stuff out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to do this because
talking about it is, I mean, what else
[SPEAKER_00]: could go better here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the thing is sitting here with
you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the dabber in my hand and we both
stared at the pilot concentrates like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, which one is he going to pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to choose which one of these and I'm
spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I, we live five miles away from,
uh, there's a dispensary north,
[SPEAKER_00]: south, east, and west from us within five
minutes of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were spoiled little bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that, but you get to grab a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab the GG four batter and
the Tropicana cookies HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to mix this up and then I
get to mix them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to, it's just like, it's the same
thing with herb though, like sitting down,
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out which one, which strain
you're going to smoke tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picking the nug, you're going to smoke out
of the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bud right here and put it in the
grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm getting myself a little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stuck the dabber in the GG four
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to like smell it and look at it and
pick a little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same thing with this
crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this little diamond on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoop up some terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just the whole ritual of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This ritual is more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm saying that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of a solo ritual,
the dab thing, but smoking a bowl with a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend is such a, like there's even more
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make that take an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just smoking one bowl with a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of medicating is what I
think I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole ritual is part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just, I'm going to consume this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I'm going to sit here for a few
minutes and get my head right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my back right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of a unity sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're connecting with yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go, I'll hit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you take a minute and just get Zen for
a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people that even roll their own
cigarettes, they'll talk about like the
[SPEAKER_01]: process is like part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking a minute away, completing
something, just a simple routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with herb or hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like karate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take time cleaning the dojo
because that's part of the art that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the karate come from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good drummer will clean and tune his
drums and cymbals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, you got to do the things
that make it mean something to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just always be bashing and getting loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I go to clean a piece of glass,
the ritual of that is, is always real
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You enjoy cleaning glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read this great thing a long time ago
that was like the nature of glass is to
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what the glass's purpose is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people are cringing hearing you
say that, but you're like, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just sort of accept that when
you buy it, every day after that is a cool
[SPEAKER_01]: bonus day with that glass and going
through and cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've broken enough pieces to know,
like the definitely don't do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when it seems like a good idea,
or it's the only way to get that little
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of resin or that little ball of hash
out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just keep putting ISO and salt in
it and keep shaking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drop it on concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, it's a ritual that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy fairly cheap glass because,
well, it's not cheap, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a super expensive piece because
I agree that it is glass and I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking it, cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grubby little paws could be a little
slippery from that alcohol and it may hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that porcelain or whatever a sink is made
out of these days and kaboosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need a new rig now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put, it was just a cheap, like an $80
bong, no down stem, just the slide in and
[SPEAKER_01]: out bowl, put that under the sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a great setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would sit just perfect with the sink
spout and it would fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't move around and I could
just turn the hot water on and let that
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch run for a while and clean out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I turned the water on and I turned
around and I was fucking around in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fridge and I heard the sound that turned
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I know what the fuck happened
before I even turned around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, right in the middle,
there's that little air bubble in that
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap ass glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass breaks folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass does break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we do have a topic, but I think
we've been having a good time just
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling about random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, I've got this dad meal right at
the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to talk for a couple of
seconds, say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I dive into the topic or go free
form?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one more thing before that's a free
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, a fun thing that happened here in
Colorado recently, um, our governor,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jared Polis, added autism officially to
the list of conditions that you can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana card in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was pretty sure that this was the
first condition we had added, but we added
[SPEAKER_01]: PTSD recently as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so huge news for folks with autism in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good news for our medical marijuana
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that has been, uh, slowly shrinking
and did nonexistence for the last couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, our rec industry has been siphoning
off patients left and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the industry was happy to have another
condition on the list, especially one that
[SPEAKER_01]: shows as much promise as autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to have more qualifying
conditions that we see some compassion
[SPEAKER_00]: coming along the way now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice to have a governor that was
out loud and proud about supporting this
[SPEAKER_01]: bill, supporting our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Jared Polis is very, very pro
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like a small dab, my friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will hold off for now folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save you the coffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He caught for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been here for over an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of people who take really
good care of us, who support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to give them a shout out about
this point of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to my friend,
Remy Redeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to Eric Ross,
a giant grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Eric Gorman, a shout out to
Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course a shout out to farmer John and
always a big shout out to our friend Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you look like you're going to say
something important.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep, uh, keep hitting the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This microphone doesn't smell like
donkey's ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should elaborate on that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the reason why the microphone cover
does not smell like donkey ass is because
[SPEAKER_00]: of our friends from Patreon that help out
with the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I use that funding to buy new
microphone covers so that when Mike comes
[SPEAKER_00]: over, I can frequently change that thing
out so that he doesn't have to spit into
[SPEAKER_00]: that same microphone cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Dev and granny has used that
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint has used that microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint has been on that microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been spitting into
that thing over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to swap out these mic covers so
they don't smell like other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: breath or donkey ass as Mike put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 12 different hippies talking to the
same microphone cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one spitting a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a while it just, it gets a little
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to clean it just like you do the
rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So swap out those covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that happens because of the loyal
listeners and the supporters that help us
[SPEAKER_00]: out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn how to become a
patron, you can go to patreon.com slash
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information that you need will
be right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, big thanks to everyone who
helps us out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, are you ready to move
into the main topic of this hashtag?
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble filled podcast
made event time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently at this time it is illegal to
offer delivery, uh, medical marijuana on
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that part of my argument is it's
already happening on the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do legal delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that comes close legally is
if you're a caregiver, uh, caring for a
[SPEAKER_01]: homebound patient and you filed paperwork
with the state as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that had to happen during the doctor
appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of hoops to jump through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about going to the medical
marijuana doctor on a recent episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched somebody have to fill out their
homebound paper and that was, that took
[SPEAKER_00]: them five times as long as it did me to
get my paperwork done in that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of extra paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently, uh, delivery is banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no delivery allowed and I'm
reaching for my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, if it looks like I'm playing with my
phone here, I'm not playing with my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got notes in here and I'm just trying
to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, uh, my phone also, I ordered a
new phone so I'll never have this excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just straight frozen and it's taken
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want an excuse to the next one
gets released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conspiracy Mike over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, delivery is not allowed at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big debate on, so right now
there, there is a bill being proposed that
[SPEAKER_00]: they do allow medical marijuana delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to start with medical marijuana
for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to give it a test run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it works, they want to
introduce the delivery system to the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some people are afraid of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it'd be fun to bring Mike on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's kind of unprepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him when he got here, basically
what the topic was going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hasn't had a lot of time to
research, which I like a lot of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when you're just fresh and you
got a rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think off the top of your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little better than giving you
too much time to prepare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that a delivery system is a
good or bad idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see any pros and cons to having
your medical marijuana delivered?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different takes on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think we've delivered everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I, if I find the right app,
I can get cigarettes delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get alcohol delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get my prescription medications
delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've had wine shipped to the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'd like a giant fucking box of wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it would have been a weird party,
but I, um, there's no reason I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to use a delivery service to get
cannabis delivered as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's gonna, uh, most of the heat
against the bill, um, from the anti pot
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd and the law enforcement community is
enforcing that it's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's so many different ways to
skirt any sort of official rule and the
[SPEAKER_01]: video requirements that we have on site in
the cannabis industry help keep everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: on the up and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and it only takes one delivery boy to
fuck it up for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet the fines would be huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the, the news station that sets
up the sting operation where instead of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, we're fucking just have some
teenager answer the door and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, my dad ordered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first dude who lets them do it and
gives them the fucking herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's a slap across all our faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not, and just, this is how I
see that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me touch the computer just to keep it
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That screensaver makes me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what I, how I feel it'll happen is the
product will be checked out from somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is going to lead into one of part
of my, so people are worried about where's
[SPEAKER_00]: the herb going to come from and it's going
to put out the dispensaries out of
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the product is going to come
from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the delivery service isn't
going to appear and have product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Domino's isn't worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their driver's going to swing by pizza hut
and pick up pizza sizzling on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the product is going to come from a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't going to shut down dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not going to come from somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be picked up at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the patient is probably going to have
to go to the dispensary and already be
[SPEAKER_00]: registered there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to go there and show
your paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show your work, show your ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me the first time it establish,
establish a connection there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign for the delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least what I know of this bill,
there's no formal system to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could fully just be like a Grubhub
app.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to have to prove that
you're a medical marijuana patient and
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're old enough somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for the first year under medical,
but um, with rec there's probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot less registering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd probably just go online,
create an, create an account.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd probably have to scan in your
driver's license or take a picture of your
[SPEAKER_01]: driver's license and attach it to your
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, however, then at that point the
driver will pick it up and now it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: that driver's responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has that has to, he's got to pay for
it somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries are really, that stuff's
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, he's either got
to pay for it at the end after the trade
[SPEAKER_00]: is made, after he makes money and brings
it back, or he's got to pay for it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, the only real loophole that
I see where it is really going to go wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: is when he gives it to like, if my
daughter answers the door when I'm pooping
[SPEAKER_00]: or something and he's like, here,
you can just sign for it little girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she signs it and sets it on the table
and I smoke it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I think the
accountability, unless somebody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: be shady, I think for the most part,
it could go right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted it to, I don't think that the
deliveries will hurt the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, cause they're going to get it
from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the worry from the industry that
I've read about is that a couple of chains
[SPEAKER_01]: or an independent delivery service will
dominate that particular piece of the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's kind of a silly worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let Walmart dominate that
particular piece of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let Best Buy dominate that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how shit goes when it becomes
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a handful of like really large
chains in Colorado and the independent
[SPEAKER_01]: operators have trouble competing with the
larger chains because the larger chains
[SPEAKER_01]: are the only ones that have the cashflow
size to really advertise a specific brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of the smaller stores that we
have in town, they haven't heard of in
[SPEAKER_01]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like we haven't heard a lot of a
lot of the smaller ones in Springs or a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the smaller ones in Trinidad,
the South of here, they just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: that level of marketing budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're worried that one of the big
chains will have a delivery service that
[SPEAKER_01]: won't operate with the small time
operators that the deliveries that
[SPEAKER_01]: customers will be able to get will
predominantly be from the big chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the people who are adamant about
getting their herb delivered will end up
[SPEAKER_01]: by default shopping with the big guy
rather than the little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a silly fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: People go where the product's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going to be my next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would, would you use a delivery
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two kids at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's finding time to go to the
dispensary is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Monday, I generally like to shop at the
dispensary on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dead on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good day to go to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll stop in on Monday and I will get
my, I try to get my supply that will last
[SPEAKER_00]: me until about Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go Thursday because I don't
want to go Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of sucks for the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the option, don't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the busiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursdays are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't get paid till Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Thursday you beat, you jump the gun,
go in there and get what you need for the
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Monday and Thursday are my favorite
days to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I went Monday, I would take a good look
at all the product, see what they've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a good once over, make a nice
selection, make a mental note of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to try next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Thursday, if I don't really feel
like putting on shoes and driving all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way over the dispensary, or if I just
simply don't have time, I may just take
[SPEAKER_00]: that delivery of my last order,
exactly what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Budtender probably has it in a
computer or something, or you could just
[SPEAKER_00]: text it or whatever, however you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, or maybe order that other one I
was looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the tech to make it super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can jump on.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a little work on the shops end to
keep their online menu current.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just jump on a couple of shops before I
even leave the house while I'm pooping in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the weed maps and a couple
other websites to see who's got what I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go shop for it today,
and then I already know where I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I'm getting when I get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most shops have that component taken care
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we really need to make a delivery
system safe and functional is banking
[SPEAKER_01]: access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every shop needs to be able to take all
major credit cards, just like every other
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would solve a couple of the
problems with this system, because right
[SPEAKER_01]: now you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to go into the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to have to do a
couple of things way above and beyond what
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have to do to get your prescription
meds or alcohol delivered to your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're starting with medical first,
which will give a real slow rollout to
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes it easy to test it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would take that midweek delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would just say, send me that
order in the middle of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go look so they think it's going
to hurt business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would hurt business
because I like to go look.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to see their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little piece of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, the part that worries me is
delivery drivers are going to be sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: ducks, like just bad, easy targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they mark themselves, if they just pull
up in a Ford Escape and a T-shirt and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dickies, nobody knows who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did Jimmy John's uniform?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gives a shit about the Jimmy John's
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Jimmy John's guy gets jacked from
time to time because people know he's got
[SPEAKER_01]: 50, 60 bucks in change on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said Jimmy John's because
they go back and forth so quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only have like 12 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their orders are pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's plenty of places where
delivery drivers, like shit, I've lived in
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhoods in Pueblo where places
straight won't deliver because they've had
[SPEAKER_01]: so many problems with their drivers in
those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Pueblo for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our delivery guys would have
slightly more problems than your average
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why I'm saying you got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I was thinking you have to go
to the dispensary and register.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're like, hey, here's my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get one address to deliver to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they know you got to call and be
like, hey, it's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm just substantially more
creative than your average criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I call you sometimes when I'm
like, hey, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I call you for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if we had banking, I think this
would be a pretty simple system and easily
[SPEAKER_01]: trackable to keep it on the up and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it passing in Colorado this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would increase dispensary
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would increase some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's honestly the best argument for
having this system now is to take another
[SPEAKER_01]: swipe at the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one real good argument,
but I'm trying to save it for the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black market delivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not even my ace in the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black market delivers all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a black market delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're delivering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to corner the market,
that's the one big piece that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, how many sick days have you had?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you got explosive diarrhea?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want me at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want me standing in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I'm sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want me smelling the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd rather just bring me the eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bring me a quarter of some good weed
so I could smoke a couple of bowls and go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I think that that's a good
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about, you got two kids, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying earlier, you can't get
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, I mean, honestly, it's a pain in
the ass because you can't like any other
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just put my kid in the cart and be
like, don't touch the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, I don't want them grabbing at
the teddy bears or the Christmas cards or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, and there's usually not even shit
to grab at a dispensary, but you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to take your kids in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also like a, if you're a decent
person in like CPA, yes, if they found out
[SPEAKER_01]: would definitely not appreciate just
leaving the kids in the parking lot for
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking 40 minutes while waiting in line
and waiting to shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do, they're way too young for
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at minimum, I have to either have
someone to watch the kids or someone to
[SPEAKER_01]: sit in the car with the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're going to murder each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an S at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mischief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just kind of a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have to find a good spot to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go to the dispensary,
now I'm getting like three or four weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: worth of product just so that I don't have
to figure out how to get away for another
[SPEAKER_01]: hour and 40 again during business hours
during, but yeah, during like this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: happens late at night, folks is the only
way we're able to get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wacky to me is that if we go to
apothecary, the dispensary four and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: miles from here, they have one entrance
where you walk into the lobby and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: see the reception person, the intake
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the appropriate word for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there's a better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm trying to use it, whatever word
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in, you say hi to the marvelous
person that greets you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you either are a medical or a
recreational shopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're rec, you go on one side of the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're medical, you go on the other
side of the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two different shopping experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for some reason we have voted that the
medical side is open until 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recreational side is open until
11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I smoke cannabis after seven,
I'm like a fucking gremlin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a mogwai.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I start smoking weed after seven o
'clock and I get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I smoke it before seven,
then I'm just medicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why those rules are
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's those little, little tidbits
that I'm useful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to say at least you're useful
for something, but I didn't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to edit that out of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of other marijuana bills
going on in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odds are there's several marijuana bills
going on in your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like us to cover one,
shoot me a message on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send Mike a Twitter message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at NemoPunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't given the opportunity to plug
himself yet, but now is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at NemoPunk15 on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I've been doing my best to remember
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support Mike's Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posts a lot of good cannabis rants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good news to keep you,
keep you up to date and informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You going to post any pictures of your
France trip on that page?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if people are like post photos on your
cannabis social media, I may.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even planning on talking about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you asked me, I was surprised,
but yeah, that's why I sound like I'm,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm half asleep or over glazed folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming and hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are looking for my Instagram,
Instagram has shut down my account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make no promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't get it back, I may make another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of nice, uh, not opening my
phone to check my Instagram every 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss all of my friends that I was
communicating with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are about 500 direct messages
