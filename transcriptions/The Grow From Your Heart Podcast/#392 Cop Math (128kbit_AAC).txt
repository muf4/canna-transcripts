[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for episode 392 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting across the table from me is a fan
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to welcome to the show,
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming and hanging out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good conversation already tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been here for a little while,
smoking some dabs, having conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed to turn on these mics probably
30 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of little fun stories that
y'all missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got us both in a good podcast
and mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get ready for some rambles,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of getting in a good podcast
mood, it is kind of tradition that we
[SPEAKER_01]: start the podcast off by talking about
what we are dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The table looks like a small buffet of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we mainly focused on the Fluffer
Nutter from Contraband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got kind of a sweet, sharp sort of a
smell that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew Mike was a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took some dabs of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also may have hit, what did we hit
before we went outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Mandarin cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had some Mandarin cookies, which had a
really an amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really pretty product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a clear yellowish color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had a little buffet of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're nice and chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, this podcast is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for fresh genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might edit that or I probably won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for fresh genetics in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit growing that old crap that you've
been growing forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some new seeds and get them from
Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to all my friends at Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's looking at me like he's got more
ads to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make a really cool
announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even an ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one more thing I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics will be at the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, DGC?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: April 13th at Cultivated Synergy in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to start sounding like the
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice almost went to the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, April 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Cultivated Synergy, the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get your tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the DudeGrows.com website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that all of the information you
need to find us at the Dude Grows Cup will
[SPEAKER_01]: be right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an invite only sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to go register with the
event, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure you've got to be 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If all that applies to you, come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good time with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing that long series of Grow
Lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not going to be a Grow Lesson,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a really cool topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to talk about the Grow Series.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have one or two more podcasts to
repost that are part of the Grow Lesson
[SPEAKER_01]: series.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm reposting old stuff,
but it falls in line perfectly with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually glad you didn't try to redo
drying hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that episode is so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original post is one of the most
listened to podcast episodes I have ever
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just reposted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's cheating, but I'm doing this
long series of Grow Lessons and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already hit the home run.
[SPEAKER_01]: No reason to try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got two more episodes that I think
will be reposted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, we will move into brand
new content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a lot of content lined up and
planned for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got stuff that I've been writing
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kind of pre-loading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got stuff pre-recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when it comes time, the Grow
Lessons are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into fresh content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys have sent me a mountain of
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to print them and I'll read a
few of them on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start digging through the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've sent some emails and I haven't
got to, just be patient and hopefully I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get to your email soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of emails, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Grow Lessons really held us back on
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an intense series of lessons,
but it's such a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I gave a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of praise and a lot of emails
through the Grow series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was time for an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been 200 episodes since the last
start to finish Grow run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since some of that stuff had even been
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've changed a lot of my ideals and
approaches and opinions on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment that's available has
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's taken 10 steps forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying how much I enjoy doing it at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad it's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of work for somebody with
my sporadic ADD to stick to a topic for
[SPEAKER_01]: that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there were interruptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do solid Grow Lessons for 14
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some interruptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike came and hung out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other things to talk about,
but for my brain to try to focus for that
[SPEAKER_01]: long, that was a task for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm trying to say is I appreciate you
for sticking through the long series of
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are two more, like I said,
than fresh content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh content.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have sent you, or if you've sent me
an email, I will get that on the show in
[SPEAKER_01]: the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all those emails, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being patient with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once again, also Mike, thanks for
coming, taking time away from the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is time to get into LePodcast.
Are you ready, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's even creepier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking around my own place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last dab has me in a weird mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm energized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that the cigarette also does a
little something to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke cigarettes, so we went
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of terrible things about
nicotine, but there's a reason people do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made you a little giddy, a little
happier after that dab, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette put you on another smiley plane,
and then we, of course, dabbed again
[SPEAKER_01]: before we recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were well lit, and that cigarette
helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does another extra thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting out helps, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been confined lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always invited, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recording or not, come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to escape my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Escape from Alcatraz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last dab still got me ringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike turned purple and white and purple
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we do have a kind of a
topic for this podcast here, and the word
[SPEAKER_01]: that I wrote down was cop math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cop math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cop math.
[SPEAKER_01]: It infuriates Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It infuriates Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the appropriate word?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is changing colors over there just
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's squirming in his seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cop math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime reporters report on a marijuana
bust of any kind, they give a money total
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there's a bunch of reports
lately out of Colorado where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: summarizing whole counties in so many
busts over a year period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they total up everything they
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found 7,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We arrested 50 people, da, da,
da, da, da, da.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's always a math problem at the
end that says, this is all worth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they give a really big number.
[SPEAKER_00]: As big as the cop can say with a straight
face is usually the number given to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dig a little bit or do the math
yourself, the math gets insane and really
[SPEAKER_00]: funny really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a running joke now that cop pop
math is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cop drug math is terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the drug math, but especially with pot
because I know pot math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's also the most sold illegal
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal lots of places now,
but just in that classification,
[SPEAKER_00]: way more people are buying marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more of it to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets found a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These reports come out a lot more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull interviews with Pueblo
sheriff or the county right up north of
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Paso County, their sheriff have been
given reports a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just Google Colorado sheriff
marijuana bust and look at the numbers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the report, the sheriff's will go on at
length about how fast marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: how fast they think marijuana grows,
how much they think it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reporters do absolutely no effort to check
all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers that get reported are just
insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the numbers are sort of like
a game of telephone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the guy that makes the bus says,
we found two grams of cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sergeant says they found five grams of
cannabis and the whoever's ahead of them
[SPEAKER_01]: goes, they found 12 grams of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They report it to the police or the news
and the news says they found 24 pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it goes like that quite
often?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot more of that when we were
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get busted with a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the report would say 15 and then
the eventual charge you face in court
[SPEAKER_00]: would be under an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Hey, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now more it's the cops need a way to
justify what they're doing and the effort
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've come up with a math problem
that makes any size marijuana bust look
[SPEAKER_00]: like darn good police work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the math they use and they're happy to
give this to reporters and reporters are
[SPEAKER_00]: universally too lazy to check this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really easy to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you just call a marijuana girl and ask
to speak to someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reporters I'm available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the math the cops use is every single
marijuana plant, every single one harvests
[SPEAKER_00]: one pound of usable product every 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant, every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants also use every single one of
them uses six gallons of water a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a whole nother way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, that's, that may be worth
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops tell the reporters over and over
and over again, one marijuana plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: one pound of usable product every 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idiot can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't, it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, every grower I know is like,
fuck, I wish I'm growing the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is the case, I've got all the
wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the last several years,
the sheriffs in Colorado then take it a
[SPEAKER_00]: step further and say, and these growers
were going to haul it to Florida or New
[SPEAKER_00]: York city where it was going to sell for
three to 4,000 a pound, which that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the math isn't totally nuts, but they're
leaving out a big piece of the story,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why they have to drive it so far
to make that kind of money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it wasn't that long ago when a
pound of marijuana cost that much here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason for that,
that the cops do not want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, the right here is we got to
get reporters to check on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I need a favor from the listening
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see marijuana news articles on
social media, please jump in the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: section and very politely say,
Hey news lady, Hey news guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, to check that math, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And call them out on their bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do this enough, reporters will start
asking cops the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they don't now is there's no
one who gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops love to tell them the numbers,
uh, much larger than it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reporter is happier to report on a
million dollar drug bus versus a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar drug bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody goes on pretending that this
was some huge deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one calls them on their bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's starting to drive me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Jeff said we need a topic for the
podcast, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I want to rat a rant about cop
math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a perfect time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These motherfuckers out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that I find hilarious,
one plant, one pound, 90 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, pull up the recent busts in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love laying the plants out in the
driveway now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all 18 to 24 inch tall veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they keep laying out in the
driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not throwing down a three gallon
pot with a quarter pound, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of usable material size plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're throwing, it's, it's a four inch
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 20 inch tall plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're laying it down in the driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're telling reporters straight
faced that that plant drinks six gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: of water a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is going to produce a pound of usable,
but in 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that's super easy to make $3,000
a pound on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three hardcore lies to the reporter
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reporter goes, thank you for lying
to me officer and reports it is gospel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the people that see it on the
news that don't have any clue,
[SPEAKER_01]: they believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now they are on that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are on prohibition side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like at this point, cops lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reporters are dumb and lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has real world implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at a certain point, the people who
get charged with these busts end up in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail, trying to explain to a judge that
the $1,500 the cops found was three months
[SPEAKER_00]: profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops are pretending that these
guys are kingpins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing that we were
going to segue into sort of is the value
[SPEAKER_01]: that they put on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that some of these busts are
worth millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll find a few pounds and then try to
exaggerate the cost of the pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do they get those numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they just create it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's always a lot of information
in the reports that gives a lie or gives
[SPEAKER_00]: away the lie that the reporter and the cop
are trying to tell the reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read between the lines,
you start asking yourself, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dude only has like 30 plants in his
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had 15 pounds of product stashed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like three harvests worth of
product he had on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't homeboy move his product any
faster than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is really worth millions and
millions of dollars and it's a black
[SPEAKER_00]: market cash only business, why did fuck
nuts only have $1,500 in the house?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops love to rant about all the guns
they find, but there's almost never a shot
[SPEAKER_00]: fired during these raids because the cops
aren't or the guns aren't for the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guns are for the robbers that the cops
entice to go there by giving these
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit reports to the reporters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the guns are just the guns because it's
Colorado and sometimes if you live in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right area, you can get a fucking bear in
your front yard and you may want a gun
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a real story in Colorado right now
where a jogger was attacked by a mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: lion and choked that fucking thing to
death with his bare hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people aren't that hardcore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people jogging on trails in
Colorado with firearms because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: wildlife that might attack you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one cares about the guns until you
put weed next to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something to add to the report
to make these people sound dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensationalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of bullshit in these reports
and it just, it shines through to anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: with a slight clue and it drives me nuts
that more people don't call this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of times what they're trying
to do if they find, we'll say five pounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: they try to break that down into gram
price and then they highly exaggerate gram
[SPEAKER_01]: price and then they multiply however many
grams times however many pounds or however
[SPEAKER_01]: many pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do the math and they say this
many dollars and they do it by grams at
[SPEAKER_01]: like 50 bucks a gram because at the very
smallest level somewhere that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a $60, $50 gram happening
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where, but some inner city
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but I was somewhere like
that that I don't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Josh?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're down there listening,
sorry bro, but it's maybe a high a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: commodity to get a gram all the way down
to Baltimore or wherever you said or
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky or wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 60 a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you multiply that by a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you multiply that by five pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it almost adds up to their inflated
numbers, but they've got to be gone with
[SPEAKER_01]: their most ridiculous prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even try.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they just guess to made a wholesale
number that sounds big and scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they're doing it by the gram
price, nobody's making that chunk of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many hands it passes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the guy that took it from
wherever, from California or Colorado,
East.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody selling pounds by the gram is
buying those pounds wholesale at a shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy delivering them probably made a
hundred a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that bought them probably the guy
that sold them originally made a hundred a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time they get all the way down
there, there's one, two, three guys making
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred bucks each off of each pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they land into some guy who sells to
the whole neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: He buys a pound of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it breaks down into probably
quarters, eights, and then a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: guys buy quarters and eights or ounces
from him and probably sell grams out of
[SPEAKER_01]: bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not one person making a whole
fucking mountain of money off of any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're unfamiliar with the process,
Jeff just outlined, pull up the union on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a movie called the union.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that it, I think it was done in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite old, but it still applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally it's the exact model that's
been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the planet for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I can talk about it so easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I understand that economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes from here to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's driving me nuts
is the reports I'm bitching about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't understand that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's new and there's no,
I mean, we've had legal marijuana stores
[SPEAKER_00]: for five years now in Colorado and there's
still zero effort to check on the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't even bother reviewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reporting the average market rate of
wholesale pounds in Colorado, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: number they report in other articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they immediately go to,
and all of this marijuana we found in
[SPEAKER_00]: Albert County is worth this much in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, we're calling the size of
the bus and it's like, well, they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: drive it all the way to Florida still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not, if you have to take it
somewhere to make it worth something,
[SPEAKER_00]: why are we pretending it's worth that now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And fucking all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my rant guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was Mike's rant about cop math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call these sons of bitches out Facebook,
Twitter, wherever you can do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hit me up at NemoPunk15 on Twitter and
tell me no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk back to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want feedback at Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I've got two more notes left and they
are on similar topics, but the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike saying call the cops out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned Mike saying to call the cops
out, but I wrote down some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interacting with the cops,
they've only got about eight minutes to
[SPEAKER_01]: mess with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's about the average time of a
traffic stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight minutes during that eight minutes
that I learned this somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give them a shout out at the
end of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that eight minutes, their goal is
to try to get you to say something stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: so that they can fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they had a reason to arrest you,
they already would have gotten you out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're waiting for you to fuck up or
they're just waiting for that 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, to come back and tell them that you
got a warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have a warrant,
if you don't have any problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have already gotten you out of
the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my best advice when you're dealing with
law enforcement other than on the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: and calling them out for shit is to shut
the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say anything when you're messing
with the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to answer these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about very different
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about asking listeners to call
bullshit on internet news stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see where cops are laughably wrong
about pop math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talking about face to face
interactions with police officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not there to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can offer you no assistance in any
way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to find a reason to take you
to jail or to leave you alone while they
[SPEAKER_00]: go look for someone else to take to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it like a commission sales job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to walk up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to pitch you a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not buying or in eight minutes,
they're going to try to find somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's got a bigger wallet so that they can
dig a little deeper and get something out
[SPEAKER_01]: of that wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're with the law enforcement,
try to handle it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five, seven, maybe eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most traffic stops will last you about
five to eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say anything stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't answer questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to talk about your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing you can say is,
I don't really want to talk about my day,
sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk about my day,
sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your head down or look them dead in
the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just body language that you were done
speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to talk about anything if
you don't want to, so don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I was reminded,
I'm going to give people a shout out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe somebody a huge shout out for giving
this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you choose to invoke the fifth,
you have to actually say the phrase,
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose to invoke the there's a great
series of videos that you can look up
[SPEAKER_00]: called flex your rights, flex like a
muscle or rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawyer's name is Billy Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's a Baltimore lawyer
actually does some great, great videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should know and watch these also
go follow the pot brothers at law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife sent me that link last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she thought I hadn't seen it,
but uh, yeah, it's another great video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your rights, exercise them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn, learn how to interact with law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of videos online where you
can watch people exercising their rights
[SPEAKER_00]: in a real dickish fashion, where their
goal is to say, ha ha, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't mess with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's super easy ways to,
to exercise a hundred percent of your
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refuse to answer questions, not give them
more than you're legally allowed or
[SPEAKER_00]: obligated to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and really hold your ground without it
all being a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a civil person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the law enforcement in which you
were interacting with is a civil dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go out of your way to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's going to go out of his way to be
a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most law enforcement are just men with
jobs trying to do right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most, there are a lot of fucking
dickheads, trust me, but a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: just honorable men trying to do an
honorable job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got rules to follow and they want
us to follow certain rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't fuck with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I don't feel like discussing my day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do all the things they ask for comply,
but don't poke the bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to poke the bear.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing, I really think it's time
that I, if the police are going to expect
[SPEAKER_01]: me to follow all these rules, and if I do
one stupid thing wrong, they can pull me
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can fuck with my whole day,
possibly ruin my entire life based on a
[SPEAKER_01]: few decisions that they decide to make
that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just depends on, it's all situational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I wish they would be held accountable
and somebody would police the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I feel the urge or need to,
like whenever it's a legitimate thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's a safety thing or it's a cop
goes bomb and buy me to a hundred when no
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on, I'll call state patrol and be
like, there's a white charger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing 110 up by 25, their license plate is
welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a dude who liked a state trooper
that liked to park in the median on a
[SPEAKER_00]: highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I drive all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that cop has scared the shit out of
me a couple of times because that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's a divided highway folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lanes on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lanes on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a green belt in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an intersection across this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a stoplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like nine lanes of moving traffic
and motherfucker would park and kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to spots, hard to see spot facing in
a direction so that he could not legally
[SPEAKER_00]: drive into a lane of traffic without doing
so in a way that was blind to the driver
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be heading to where he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not explaining this well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in a dipshit spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this fucking cop pulled out after
anybody, the odds he created an accident
[SPEAKER_00]: were a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also coming up when you're approaching an
intersection, if you drive at all like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm scanning that intersection before I
come up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see if anybody's going to turn
in front of me or I could see if anybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pull out from just run the red
light and T-bone me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of scanning that cop would park
in such a way that he would just disrupt
[SPEAKER_01]: my view of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have to hit the brakes and be
like, what the fuck is that weird car
[SPEAKER_01]: doing in the middle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're not going to hit him
because the way the lanes are aligned,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll go right around him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's, he's a weird obstruction of your
view.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wondering why there's a vehicle
where there shouldn't be a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start looking at that vehicle and
instead of where you should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be looking at the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be looking at the lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead you're going, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that moving?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it parked?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to hit it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it coming at me?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that guy there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in need of assistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a wreck that I'm not seeing?
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, it's more of a hazard than
any sort of help he could ever be in that
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I would see that dipshit and
this happened a half dozen times over like
[SPEAKER_00]: a four month period before you stop
parking there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call the non-emergency number for
state patrol and say either there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: disabled charger in the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the first couple of calls,
I just gave up the disabled car ruse and
[SPEAKER_00]: just said, okay, so I know you guys don't
tell them where to park, but if this dude
[SPEAKER_00]: pulls out in a hurry for any reason,
he's going to get hurt or kill someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terror.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like someone needs to talk to this idiot
and be like, okay, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to do sneaky speed
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Park someone where somewhere where you're
not going to kill people pulling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a home way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't park there no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's, there's absolutely no rule
that says you can't call the cops on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if more people did this more
often, it would solve a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we got them to stop running
around everywhere at a hundred miles an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we were kids, that shit was
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you almost never see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up just a city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I grew up on Compton Boulevard,
literally like the street at the end of my
[SPEAKER_01]: block was Compton Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk about seeing some
police chases, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I grew up in white bread land in
suburbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cops used to have the run of the place
and no one ever said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can't do 55 there, why are you doing
80 with your, without the lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: sirens?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on your way to stop a crime,
like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on your way to lunch or back
to the office, like inappropriate and
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it is for me and you're not special.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kid plays in this neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't hit him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough people took those complaints public
that a bunch of rules and laws got passed
[SPEAKER_00]: and now cops can get in all kinds of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get caught flipping their lights
on to jump red lights or speeding up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can even pull video on YouTube,
cops pulling other cops over for speed and
[SPEAKER_00]: just roast them for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a weird duality with our,
our thoughts and actions and kind of views
[SPEAKER_00]: on the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, we kind of embrace a
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police culture is sort of a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a general societal feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, there are endless
cop shows and there's the real follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: cops around while they stop criminals type
cops type shows that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a thousand dramas where
it's, it's, it's scripted television.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not legit at all, but the lead
characters are cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're following cops around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plot is cops get bad guy justice
served.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been one of the best genres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millions of Americans watch cop shows and
share in root for the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between the cops we
interact with on in the real world and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cops on TV is that nine times out of 10,
the cops on TV, when one of the cops on TV
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, I'm a break the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other cops on TV go, no, you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting in trouble too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in reality we see all the other cops
go then blue line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly think that's where the
disconnect comes in is because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see enough accountability amongst those
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peer pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this show took a weird turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did, but I like those weird turns.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the audience likes the,
the weird turns.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to come get stoned with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cameras have had a lot of
influence on law enforcement interaction
[SPEAKER_01]: on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I believe people are performing
for the camera when interacting with law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement a little too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spoke earlier about data on the first
year or two of people, the departments
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the cameras in complaints on both
sides fell like 60 or 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not just saying the people that
those guys that sit in there, I know my
[SPEAKER_01]: rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting out of the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are a little extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking like some of the people that
get a little ridiculous with the police,
[SPEAKER_01]: like physical and act like a fucking
complete asshole on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of those people were just
showing off because we have too many
[SPEAKER_01]: cameras now, but also I think it does,
like you said, it makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: accountability a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go anywhere around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go out to the sticks or
somewhere to not be on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're probably on a fucking
trail cam also out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cameras everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition of the body cam for a lot of
police departments is just drastically
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped the number of complaints on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not already on camera,
Tony's probably flying a drone around
[SPEAKER_01]: finding you with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not a security camera,
it's a drone or a private camera or a
[SPEAKER_00]: doorbell camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting until we've all got one
on our foreheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just scanning everything all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recording, recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Google classes was basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just barely though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just barely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all going to be just human
Teslas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Autopilot all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically are with the phone in our
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just on autopilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the phone's not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it was the phone, it was the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The newspaper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandpa had the newspaper to his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was just holding it there so
that nobody would talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't take that long to read the
fucking newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great way to tell everyone else
in the room to shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this big three foot square of go fuck
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you had to open it made a
noise that told everyone around you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it creates this like little barrier
around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no eye contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks just like the iPad, except it
doesn't light up at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, we've got plenty of
material to where even once I edit out the
[SPEAKER_01]: weird shit, we'll still have a quality
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make it better and let's take some
dabs and see where the conversation goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's that random request I had for
the listeners that I said I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're asking me to remember stuff and
we've been taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a really long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was between dabs one and two.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, now you're creating more editing,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take some dabs of the, and let's hit
the fluffernutter.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can reach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff is tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The container says it is 74.62% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, I just teetered up this
nail way too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to let it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to hit this, uh,
this fluffernutter from contraband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think how to describe the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a candy dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear your question, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I'm going to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terminology that I've always heard
for the leftover smoke in a bong hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to take a bong hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't click clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leftover smoke is referred to as a
buffalo fart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure this has regional variations,
which I would love to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is A, what do you call
the leftover bong smoke in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, is there a different term for left
over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Leftover vapor in a dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please tweet answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we originally talked about this
earlier, I didn't remember the term that
[SPEAKER_01]: we used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just came to me as I was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, people say that dabbing might be bad
for your memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it brought shit back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to call that rebong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smoke that's left in the bong is
rebong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my buddy Josh would grab it and
blow into the downstem to blow air into it
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that smoke out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to safely clear a
buffalo fart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day I told him, I said,
bro, I think I'd rather have rebong than
[SPEAKER_01]: rebreath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all thought about that for a couple
of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I think I'm just going to
blow it on myself every time now,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of letting you blow it out or
somebody else blow out the rebong for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rebong from where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buffalo fart is where Mike is from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call that stale smoke left in
the bong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, how do you get that shit out of
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to blow through the downstem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you end up with a lump full of
stale smoke and then you cough till you
[SPEAKER_00]: die.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about rebong then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how do you feel about rebong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you blow through the downstem to
clear the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you turn the bong around to hit a
normal and refill it with normal air
[SPEAKER_00]: before you pass it along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a fucking savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a caveman about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you raised in a frat house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear your buffalo fart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first question there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we call a buffalo fart or rebong
where you're from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then question number two or part B or
addendum A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike made a really good face at addendum
A.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call the smoke that is left in
the rig after you take a big dab and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't clear it and you just give it up and
you set it down and there's a little smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in there like mine's got going on
right now because I don't want to cough
[SPEAKER_01]: too much on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call that stale bong rebong or
a dab buffalo fart?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet Mike at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good answers on Twitter will get liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you maybe follow them back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also tweet me, include me,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: At Rasta Jeff420 or if you really want to
get fancy, include the podcast at
[SPEAKER_01]: GFYHpodcast on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exceptional answers might get retweeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will retweet some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about a good retweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one button.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get wild and start promising
ludicrous things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a stick with the ludicrous or
unludicrous things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by sticking with ludicrous things means
you're going to make huge promises and
[SPEAKER_01]: under deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be a ludicrous thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag fire fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for my, my brain sort of
resin clogged on like there's underwhelmed
[SPEAKER_00]: and overwhelmed, but there isn't a wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said ludicrous in my brain went like
Chris isn't a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just kind of froze there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs don't open up pathways that
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they clog them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had something else I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retweets a lot like flushing your plants
are absolutely free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: People should do more of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you want to dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love a dib.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dib.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like half grams are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost need you to get a smaller dab
tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to baby burn it, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to fucking drop a dab on the
nail and smoke most of it and then let you
[SPEAKER_01]: have what's left?
[SPEAKER_00]: You did pretty good with the last size
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just the snow shovel contraption
you're using is it's hard to get the small
[SPEAKER_00]: dab on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at happy daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the glob father to dabber here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get a teaspoon in a backhoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's what'd you call her?
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little dab for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is a cigarette consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when he hits this dab, I'll have to
turn off his mic for three to seven
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to be chatting all by
myself here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike, while I heat this up,
I'll turn down my microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell people about your
Facebook page and about your Twitter and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw out some plugs while I heat up a
nail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, folks looking for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me at Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws on Facebook or at Nemo punk
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, everybody that hears me on the show
follows me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Nemo punk at Nemo punk 15 on
Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I almost never post like seven posts
in five years guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, you can follow me on all
those social medias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have none.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read more news, have more pro cannabis
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your family members.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's come out of the cannabis closet to
everybody but your boss with the good
[SPEAKER_00]: health insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come out of the cannabis closet and then
hang some lights in that closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're out of the closet,
there's room for lights and a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ventilation is key in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just trying to clean it up for you a
little bit, which is silly because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to dirty it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then we'll hit it with a Q-tip and
clean it back up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That nail is brand new.

dab.

Yeah.
