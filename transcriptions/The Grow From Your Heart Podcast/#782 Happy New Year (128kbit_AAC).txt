[SPEAKER_00]: add some new things to irie direct.com the
best way to stay updated on what is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: to irie direct.com is to join the
newsletter on irie genetics.com i know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot to handle there are two
websites but there are reasons to that go
[SPEAKER_00]: to irie genetics.com sign up for the
newsletter there if you scroll almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to the bottom of the page at irie
genetics.com you'll see a tab that says
[SPEAKER_00]: stay updated or stay in touch i don't
remember exactly what it says i looked
[SPEAKER_00]: just a minute ago i cannot remember what
it says i think it says stay in touch or
[SPEAKER_00]: stay updated type in your email address
right there that will add you to my
[SPEAKER_00]: mailing list that way every time i do a
sale a new drop an exclusive deal
[SPEAKER_00]: something fancy an event comes up maybe
i'm going to be somewhere i will let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know through that newsletter so go to irie
genetics.com scroll most of the way down
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see the tab it's fairly obvious
type in your email address sign up for
[SPEAKER_00]: that newsletter i did mention that i was
going to be putting new things on irie
[SPEAKER_00]: direct i'm also going to be doing testing
a little bit differently here in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year before i've been taking tester
applications through emails and through
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord i'm not going to be doing as
much of that if you've sent an application
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a tester those are still in the
running those will still be considered i
[SPEAKER_00]: do go through those randomly when i have
some time and pick out some folks
[SPEAKER_00]: but i do have a strategy of how i want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be up to the next 12 months so that
means every month new tester packs from me
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody gets freebies when you order on
irie direct part of those freebies will be
[SPEAKER_00]: free tester packs a lot of people love
getting that brand new stuff you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something nobody else has because you've
got it before everybody because you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: tester you may have the next big winner
you may have the next champion from my
[SPEAKER_00]: line you may get to test grow it before
everybody else if you are growing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable gain that may set you apart
from the rest of the market that may
[SPEAKER_00]: really help you out so they will be going
out as freebies on irie direct i will also
[SPEAKER_00]: add them to irie direct for a very low
price i'll be putting i've been doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been putting big mountain fudge cake
testers on the website they went very well
[SPEAKER_00]: i put the testers clearly labeled that
they are testers i put them at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable price there's a little note
attached to the package that lets you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can expect lets you know what i
expect there's a link to the discord that
[SPEAKER_00]: way you can sign up to our discord and
post all of your tester photos and
[SPEAKER_00]: information to the discord tester tab so
there are two ways to get the new tester
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds they will become coming as freebies
from orders on irie direct and also i may
[SPEAKER_00]: add some of them randomly to the irie
direct website for a very limited price
[SPEAKER_00]: and again those will be at very limited
quantities if you have tested for me in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past don't feel like you're going to
get left out i've got a list of testers i
[SPEAKER_00]: see your pictures i see your names in my
computer in my phone don't worry you will
[SPEAKER_00]: not get left out i do consider you for
testing in the future if you've already
[SPEAKER_00]: been testing and you want more tester
seeds reach out either via email or on
[SPEAKER_00]: discord let me know say hey bro i finished
up the last run of testers here are the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures really love to run a new batch
for you i like repeat offenders if you
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and test for me again that means
that you understood the assignment the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time you probably did a good job
i'll probably give you seeds again and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll keep it going we'll keep your garden
fresh keep it new keep my photos keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: data coming we'll work out together very
well like that so so don't feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get left behind or pushed
out or forgotten if you've been testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for me before i just want to establish new
relationships with new testers because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't noticed i've been making a lot
of seeds and i need to get them out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and i'd like to get them thoroughly tested
so we can get them to the people who need
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow them i know i mentioned this just
a moment ago but if you do get tester
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds please join the discord and post
photos of those tester seeds in the irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics tester tab if you're on the
discord on the left side if you scroll
[SPEAKER_00]: down on the irie genetics discord there
are a bunch of tabs different places to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one that says testers click on
there you can post your pictures you can
[SPEAKER_00]: post data you can scroll up and see what
other people are posting you can either
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the kind of guideline or you can
set the standard and create new trends
[SPEAKER_00]: post any of the information you think i
might want to know how long you grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: how many of the plants germinated how long
you flowered it for if you noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: anything weird let me know any details you
think may be interesting to myself or
[SPEAKER_00]: other people growing that strain in the
future all right i think that covers
[SPEAKER_00]: testers you guys let's move forward to the
main chunk of this podcast of course we
[SPEAKER_00]: are entering a brand new year here a lot
of people like that new year new me new
[SPEAKER_00]: year new start sort of stuff why not use
this new calendar year as a new goal
[SPEAKER_00]: setting phase a new time phase to start
fresh and get things going start
[SPEAKER_00]: documenting doing things properly let's
jump into it and talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about creating a good start and a good
strategy for a brand new year in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion everything goes better with a good
strategy with a good plan with a good
[SPEAKER_00]: expected outcome with sort of a plan of
what could go wrong what to look for and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to react to those things as it happens
if you go into things blindly you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have no idea how that shit is going to
turn out not just in growing but almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in life works that way the
better you prepare the more you plan the
[SPEAKER_00]: better it's going to go of course you got
to be spontaneous and have some fun the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow works that way too but if we've got a
strategy got an idea have a an expected
[SPEAKER_00]: goal written down it is easier to reflect
on things and see where we are with our
[SPEAKER_00]: progress so my question to you is do you
have a goal for your grow this year is
[SPEAKER_00]: there something you want to improve on is
there something you want to work on let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about a few goals that you could have
in your grow room for this year maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing I would do is identify the
weak spot what are you not good at in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room for a long time my weak spot was
cloning I told one of my friends I said
[SPEAKER_00]: hey bro I really suck at cloning and he
I've done a full podcast about this and he
[SPEAKER_00]: came over and he showed me step-by-step
how to make clones guess what now my clone
[SPEAKER_00]: game is on top of shit figure out what
your weakness is find out where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking in the grow let's identify that
and let's make that your strongest part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow then next time we'll identify the
next weakness and we'll make that the
[SPEAKER_00]: strongest part we'll just keep
leapfrogging your weaknesses into your
[SPEAKER_00]: strongest points in the grow so let's
identify the weakness maybe you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: good at cloning maybe you're really not
good at lolly popping maybe you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to pop and twist maybe you're no good
at working a trellis maybe there's things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need to work on in the grow that
I'm not even aware of so identify your
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest weakness in the grow maybe you're
not good at taking clones maybe you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: good at popping and twisting maybe you're
not good at lolly popping maybe you've
[SPEAKER_00]: never topped a plant because you're afraid
maybe you don't know how to work a trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: or a scrog identify your weakness and
let's fix that right here at the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year let's make that one of the first
projects that we correct some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we do in the grow are more
measurable than others the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: effort we put in the amount of time we
spend in there the amount of work we do
[SPEAKER_00]: that's only measurable by hours and
actually by the outcome things that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually measure though are how much
product did you produce last year do you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much herb you produced in the
last 365 days are you a flower grower how
[SPEAKER_00]: much usable smokable flour did you produce
are you a concentrate maker how much
[SPEAKER_00]: usable smokable concentrate did you
produce then the next question what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened all that do you have something to
show for it did you smoke all of it which
[SPEAKER_00]: is just fine you grew it to consume it but
if you are somebody who is making a profit
[SPEAKER_00]: or providing a product to somebody what
happened to that product is was their
[SPEAKER_00]: income made from that product what
happened to that money did that go
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere did you put that in the bank did
you buy sneakers with it are you living
[SPEAKER_00]: off a part of it did you invest part of it
into the grow where did that money go so
[SPEAKER_00]: the first question how much product did
you produce in the last year like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a flower producer how much
flower if you're a concentrate maker how
[SPEAKER_00]: much concentrate did you produce then
where did that go did you smoke it did you
[SPEAKER_00]: move it then where did the money go now
let's think about these things did you
[SPEAKER_00]: produce enough out of what you produced
did you have enough to smoke did you have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to do whatever you're doing with it
then if money was made from that product
[SPEAKER_00]: did you make enough money to cover your
work your energy your costs and then have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough money to make it worth your time
those are things I would think about so
[SPEAKER_00]: how much product did you produce in the
last year and the next question is how
[SPEAKER_00]: much do you plan to produce in the next
year are you going to increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: production or are you okay with the amount
that you produced can you increase
[SPEAKER_00]: production with your space can you
increase production 10 20 maybe 30 with
[SPEAKER_00]: the room space you've got if you put more
time and energy into it could you do that
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know I don't know how hard you
worked last year but that is a goal that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would set how much more product am I going
to produce this year my next question is
[SPEAKER_00]: on a scale of 1 to 10 how good is your
product and this is where people get
[SPEAKER_00]: really messed up in their heads you have
got to be honest with yourself about your
[SPEAKER_00]: product on a scale of 1 to 10 how good is
your product you may say out loud it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 because everybody's gonna say their
herb is a 10 but you may know inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit's a 4 and you got to work on
getting it up to a 6 so be honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself give your herb an honest
assessment compare it to a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: herb find other growers that you respect
don't put yourself in a group of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think you are better growers than
them and compare your herb to it because
[SPEAKER_00]: of course it'll be better go find growers
that you respect that you think are better
[SPEAKER_00]: growers than you also hang out with the
growers that you think you're better than
[SPEAKER_00]: them all of you put your herb in the table
and compare it let's see what everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing find out where you really stand in
the game and be honest with yourself if
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit's not selling if it's not moving
that's a 3 or a 4 bro 10 level 10 weed
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking moves itself 10 level 10 weed you
don't have to sell it that shit sells
[SPEAKER_00]: itself you just got to drive it to the
next customer so give your weed a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable assessment on a scale of 1 to
10 how good is it if you can get a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: test a potency test which that again
that's gonna raise a lot of controversy
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe you've got a lab test to compare
it to what's your THC percentage your CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage what's your terpene percentage
can we increase and improve on those
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers or can you just grow herb that you
think is better than the herb you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing now on a scale of 1 to 10 how good
is your weed if it's a 5 what would make
[SPEAKER_00]: it a 7 if it's a 7 what would make it an 8
if it's an 8 what would make it a 10
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the issue was it something with
the nutrients was it something in the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and cure did you overwater it did the room
get too hot can you tell by looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that there was a fungus nap problem
or can you tell by looking at the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was a root aphid problem or can
you tell by looking at the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters and the little tiny misshapen
buds that there was a russet mite issue
[SPEAKER_00]: can you tell those things correct those
issues does it taste funky was it too
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy did you let it get too dry correct
those issues you can see the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: let's take your herb from a 6 to an 8 or
an 8 possibly to a 10 if you can do it of
[SPEAKER_00]: course you got to get your ego out of the
way to be able to do that one now here's
[SPEAKER_00]: some more fun things to talk about how
many strains do you want to try this year
[SPEAKER_00]: do you know what you want to grow are you
going to grow the same old shit or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a few strains chosen and selected on
your menu that you'd like to try to run
[SPEAKER_00]: this year do you have a schedule do you
have a plan do you know how many crops
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to turn this year have you
divided the amount of days you use to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower by the amount of days in the year
to see how many crops you can fit in that
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room and see if you can cram one
more in by doing something weird by just
[SPEAKER_00]: using space over here to move move this
room from veg to flower a week early while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all in there and then maybe i
could squeeze in one more crop this year
[SPEAKER_00]: have you done that math that's stuff that
i start thinking about right now at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the year which breeders are
you going to support this year of course i
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you buy iri genetic seeds you're
going to find some good shit in there but
[SPEAKER_00]: there are tons of other great breeders out
there putting out great products who are
[SPEAKER_00]: you going to support this year what
strains from which breeders do you plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow then my next question is are you
breeding do you have breeding goals what
[SPEAKER_00]: is your breeding goal for the year do you
plan to f2 something are you going to f3
[SPEAKER_00]: something are you how far are you going to
go are you going to make a new cross how
[SPEAKER_00]: many new crosses are you going to make how
many overall seeds do you plan or attend
[SPEAKER_00]: or intend anticipate making in the next
calendar year those are things to write
[SPEAKER_00]: down if you're a seed breeder what is your
goal for seed breeding are you trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get those seeds to market are you trying
to make seeds for you are you trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds for the homies What are you
trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to isolate a terpene,
a cannabinoid, a trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down those goals and figure out what
you want to do as a breeder this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower, you need very specific
calendars and ideas and goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, those are even more
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to setting some goals,
writing down a plan, setting up some ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we know where we're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just running through this year
with no map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the map printed out so we can
all end up at the same winning
[SPEAKER_00]: destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something in your grow,
a chore, a task, a mess, a problem that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been avoiding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that right here at the start of
the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a problem that needs to be fixed
and cost some money, let's throw some
[SPEAKER_00]: money at it and fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a mess you need to clean up,
get in there and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a shelf that needs to be
reorganized or a bunch of shit that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be thrown away or lights that need to
be rehung, let's just do that right here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bang it out, get it out of the way,
start fresh so we can just rock this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: year nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that task you've been avoiding,
identify it, and let's make it a habit to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it enjoyable, feel some pride when
you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also, this is a good time to clean
everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff that needs to be cleaned,
you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start from the top and work my
way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tops of the lights are probably dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of lights you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tops of whatever lights you're using,
they're probably dusty and need a dusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get up there and clean those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a ladder out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a ladder, a couple of rags,
some spray bottles, some cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to work and clean all this shit
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the top and work our way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wipe everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got air conditioning,
if you've got ducting, if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: venting, it probably all needs to be wiped
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the tables, clean the trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, here in Colorado, it's like 20
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking shit outside and hosing it down
is not a fun option right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a place where you can
load up the shit and take it to the car
[SPEAKER_00]: wash, one of those outdoor car washes,
go spray the shit out of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use too much of that car wash soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hose there and spray the shit out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse it real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get everything super clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off nice and clean here for the
start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this is a good time to change all of
your filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's got a filter, everything's
got a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air conditioner, the humidifier,
the dehumidifier, all those filters in
[SPEAKER_00]: your hydro gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first of the month, the first of
a new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with all new filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know most of us are using LED lighting
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of high pressure sodium
light fixtures in one grow space because
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets very cold in that building and I
use those HPS lights to keep that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the first of the year, I would
change the bulbs in those high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would do is I would take a
piece of duct tape and I would write new
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs January 1st, 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would stick that right on either the
door to the grow room or I would tape it
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the reflector itself out of the way
on the side of the reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick that duct tape either on the door or
on the reflector to indicate new bulbs
[SPEAKER_00]: January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have got new bulbs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you don't need to worry about that
because you've got the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're running something with a
switchable bulb, why not put new bulbs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and mark the date that you did it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when you switched bulbs if
you're using old lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody's in a legal growing state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has access to new modern
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there are using old
magnetic ballasts and HPS bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So switch those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys put on a new bulb if you can do
that here at the start of the year and
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely mark it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also mark down when you change all those
filters that we talked about changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard to write just either in
a notebook or a ledger or a Google Doc or
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change my filters, change my bulbs January
1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're changing bulbs and changing
filters, you know it's also time to
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate all of our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a pH pan, now is a good time
to calibrate that pH pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also if you've got any automation or room
sensors that are checking for moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, temperature, I'm not sure which
sensors you're using, but now is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time to clean them, calibrate them,
and test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure that all of the expensive
toys we're buying and using are taken good
[SPEAKER_00]: care of and up to speed and calibrated so
they work the way we're expecting them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean all the filters, calibrate all
the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what filters, I don't know
what needs to be cleaned in your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got an air conditioner filter,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably a dehumidifier filter,
a humidifier filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go clean all the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the fans are super funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you by now they're dirty and
need a cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a general inspection and prepare for
a big spring cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a moment ago that it's 20
degrees here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to prepare for a spring
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bang out one more crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that crop will be done by
March, the middle of March at the latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of that crop I'm going to tear
down the entire room and do a full spring
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning, rehang everything all over again
because of course when spring gets here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado we've got to redo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the rooms have to be redone and
reconfigured a little bit differently
[SPEAKER_00]: because like I mentioned it's been
negative six uh somewhere between uh it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been cold you guys don't care about
specific numbers it's been fucking cold
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to get the opposite here in
about six months it'll be 114 degrees so
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to reconfigure my grow at the
spring time to prepare for that stuff so
[SPEAKER_00]: get yourself ready for a spring cleaning
if you are in a cold area definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: inspect the air conditioner the the
dehumidifier the humidifier all that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that moves all the ducting all the
ventilation if you've got co2 production
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment if it's a burner or if it's
tanks definitely inspect all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like to do here at the
start of the year is order all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies I anticipate I will need for the
next couple of months shipping is really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive sometimes you'll get a deal on
ordering things in bulk so I like to just
[SPEAKER_00]: place a big order and get all of the stuff
I need all at one time at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year things like nutrients pesticides and
gloves we know we're going to use those
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have those things why not
order them here at the start of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: get them out of the way that way the
budget is freed up for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year so get nutrients pesticides gloves
things like scissors how many pairs of
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors will you go through in the next
couple of months I know I'll need at least
[SPEAKER_00]: two why not order two maybe if somebody
comes to help I'll need two pairs of
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors ISO I go through a lot of
isopropyl alcohol here not just for
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning shit in the grow but also for
cleaning shit like smoking accessories for
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning the table everything is sticky
here so I got to order a bunch of ISO here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the start of the year just to have it
available what are you using to clean your
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors to prevent the spread of hot
plate and viroid are you cleaning your
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors with anything maybe you need a
small container of bleach in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you need more cleaning supplies in
your grow I don't know exactly what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need but now is a good time to think about
ordering those things you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: some cleaning supplies like a mop some
sort of a cleaner maybe rags maybe spray
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles I don't know how you do it but I
know that I need those products other
[SPEAKER_00]: things I think about is refreshing my
mixing cups and measuring devices some of
[SPEAKER_00]: my nutrients are powdered I use a scale
make sure that scale is nice and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure it's zeroed and dialed in that
way I've got a good measurement my
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring cups are filthy I try to clean
them but after a while they get stained I
[SPEAKER_00]: use liquid nutrients with colors the the
cups have changed colors they look like
[SPEAKER_00]: shit it's hard it's not completely easy to
read the measurements I will replace those
[SPEAKER_00]: here at the start of the year just because
I want to make sure I am measuring my
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive nutrients as accurately as
possible so make a big order order all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the supplies you need here right at the
start of the year now that leads me into
[SPEAKER_00]: another part that we should talk about
maybe now is a good time to start keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: a ledger or keeping track of your grow
cost what are you spending on electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you spending on nutrients co2 all
of that stuff adds up and matters write
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that stuff down then document how
much product you produced estimate how
[SPEAKER_00]: much that product is worth and see if you
are making a profit or a loss also include
[SPEAKER_00]: your time in there you're spending time in
the grow maybe it's time to start keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: track of how many hours a day or a week
you are actually in that grow space so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start documenting things like
electrical spending nutrient spending how
[SPEAKER_00]: much do all those nutrients cost every
bottle let's write it down how much are
[SPEAKER_00]: you spending on co2 did you buy a co2
burner did you buy a setup and are you
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing bottles every week what are you
doing for co2 augmentation also people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think about the cost of water it
comes out of a faucet you turn it on it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out we don't think about paying for
it at the end of the month how much water
[SPEAKER_00]: are you spending do you pay the water bill
or does the landlord pay the water bill if
[SPEAKER_00]: the landlord pays it are they noticing
that you're using extra water for the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a small grow probably not if
you've got a few lights they might notice
[SPEAKER_00]: the increase in water fees how about rent
for the building if you're growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: building that is not your home you're
probably paying extra rent for that
[SPEAKER_00]: building what does that cost you is that
eating up your profits i know it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only place you've got to do it but let's
include that into the cost of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: business here how about employees do you
have a trimmer do you have a bro that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes and helps you or a lady that comes
and helps you do you have security do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a dog that dog that works security at
the grow that is a cost you got to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog it's got to go to the vet that is
part of your cost of doing business for
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow how about gas do you have to
drive to the grow or if the grows located
[SPEAKER_00]: in your home you got to walk down there
that doesn't cost anything but if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to drive a few miles to it that does
add up over the year how much does that
[SPEAKER_00]: gasoline cost speaking of gasoline how
about a backup generator diesel fuel costs
[SPEAKER_00]: money did you buy a generator did you have
that attached to your breaker box in your
[SPEAKER_00]: home do you have diesel fuel in that
generator do you have all the switches and
[SPEAKER_00]: jump boxes you needed to where when the
power goes off in your spot that generator
[SPEAKER_00]: fires up immediately in your home so where
you don't even notice there was a miss in
[SPEAKER_00]: power do you have that how much did it
cost how much does the diesel fuel that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in their cost if it comes on it
immediately starts costing you money that
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel feels running costing you money
tick tock tick tock ching ching ching
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just coins falling through the
generator machine right there how much
[SPEAKER_00]: does that cost you what about security
costs do you have security are you
[SPEAKER_00]: security did you buy anything to use as
security in case something goes wrong all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things cost you money are you
using cameras the cameras are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cost you money write that down also if you
use cameras are you providing the service
[SPEAKER_00]: are you providing the data or do you have
a service backing up all the video footage
[SPEAKER_00]: for you most of us have a ring cam or the
the blink cam or some service out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that you got to pay bucks a month or
something for are you paying for that
[SPEAKER_00]: write that down document that in your
ledger treat this like a real business if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it to be profitable if you want
to make money off of it if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: document your spending income and outcome
profit and loss you've got to document all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this stuff it's how a real business
does it and you've got to start doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: what else are you paying for i'm not sure
the other specifics in your grow but
[SPEAKER_00]: everything costs money do you have to put
up new mylar did you have to buy a new pen
[SPEAKER_00]: to film did you have to replace a light
document all of that stuff a ph pin ph
[SPEAKER_00]: down all that shit's going to cost money
now is a good time to start documenting
[SPEAKER_00]: things and keeping notes for a whole year
worth of bookkeeping you can do this on
[SPEAKER_00]: paper you can do it on google sheets you
can do it in whatever there's a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods of doing this as long as
you're doing it in some sort of way making
[SPEAKER_00]: an effort you'll improve on it every year
and you'll realize there are better easier
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to do it so start making notes start
keeping that profit and loss sheet start
[SPEAKER_00]: documenting how many plants did you grow
if you can that's another i've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: words be careful written right here really
big on my notes if you can safely document
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff document as much as possible
how many plants did you grow this run how
[SPEAKER_00]: many days did they go how much did each
plant harvest what was your total harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: weight and then how much from that harvest
weight do you think that that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: market value then look back and see what
it cost you to produce each gram of that
[SPEAKER_00]: herb then look and see if like i said
before you've got to pay yourself do you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a salary included in there maybe
include write down how many hours are in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and see if you even make a salary
let's start marking all of that down but
[SPEAKER_00]: again be very careful because that if
you're not in a legal state that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous data so the most important part
here is we've just been new and
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable we've just been stirred up
and shaken up a lot of us are getting back
[SPEAKER_00]: to normal from it i still see weird
lasting effects like you see weird
[SPEAKER_00]: societal effects from being locked down
for fucking two years the world is just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting its shit back together a lot of my
favorite restaurants and stores of things
[SPEAKER_00]: are just fucking gone things have
disappeared things are different now but
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels like things are kind of it's kind
of starting to get back to as close to
[SPEAKER_00]: normal as we're going to feel like for a
little while it's going to take a while
[SPEAKER_00]: before we feel real normalcy again but
we're starting to get there it's headed
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction so Supplies are coming back
schedules are coming back people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: Sick and fucking quarantining and hiding
from each other as much as we were before
[SPEAKER_00]: so the world is coming back Let's kick
