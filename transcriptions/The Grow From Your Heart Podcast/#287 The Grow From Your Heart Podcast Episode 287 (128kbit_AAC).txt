[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 287 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coop and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to you
on a frosty, cold Colorado evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been snowing for about 18 hours now
and there is no end in sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking cold out there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow is deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The streets are slick and it fucking
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to brave the cold to go grab some
hash today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running low on concentrates and with
the storm coming down, I was not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get trapped at home without enough hash,
without enough concentrates to smoke on
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the weekend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made it over to Doctor's Orders and I
grabbed myself some of this sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar and some sour diesel live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was extracted by our friends at the
Garden of Weeden and they always do great
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Doctor's Orders at Stem
Beach and also a big shout out to our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at the Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lit up on this sour diesel,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very unique high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does something that not a lot of
strains do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that eye thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when you smoke flowers,
your eyes get droopy and you get stoned,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I smoke concentrates,
I don't get the droopy eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sour diesel does that shit to my eyes
and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to my friends for the great service
out there at Doctor's Orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do work for another dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of far away and it was fucking
snowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This place was closer and they have
quality products and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends work out there too and they
were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were helpful and they made
recommendations on products that I
[SPEAKER_00]: approved of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do support other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you shop at the one I
grow for, but you got to go other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my friends that took good
care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into a podcast a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about my breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys seem to love it when I talk about
the breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had two projects going simultaneously
in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was including the Stardog
Cross to Arise and the Durban Poison Cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to Arise and Platinum Tangy to Arise and
there were several others in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have been harvested,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban Poison took a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're younger than everybody else,
but they are harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are hanging up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have been bucketed or put
into bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just break them off the stick into the
bins and let the buds dry out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go and mash it up into little tiny
pieces with my hands and then I will pull
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at a seed separating machine,
but it is quite pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be in the future, but yeah,
they are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're drying up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the very near future, we will have
some new crosses to test and I will also
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to replenish the Helidank Seed
Bank with brand new batches of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the other breeding project I'm
working on is a reversed blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a blueberry cookies girl that I
treated with a silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned it into a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dropped pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that pollen on another blueberry
cookies female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put that pollen on a Platinum Tangy
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that pollen on a Strawberry Fields
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put that pollen on Durban Poison
and Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be another one in there,
but I can't think of what it is off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping to make a whole bunch of
candy flavored turp filled plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those crosses with that experiment
there with that breeding project,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those probably won't be available
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I like what I've made,
I will do it again and we will make those
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized blueberry skunk reversals
available at the Helidank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to segue into some
advertising with the Helidank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for irie genetic seeds,
look no further than the Helidank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit dankseed.store for all of your irie
genetics needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do you guys want to talk about
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got four brand new iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it when you guys leave
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually ratings and reviews on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in leaving an iTunes
rating and review, simply go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a section, go to the search bar,
type in the name of the girl from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a section right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to click on an amount of
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scrolling up to see so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 94 ratings and it says 5.0 out of
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that bad rating was, it got
removed or it got corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that only gave me four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 94 five-star reviews,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in and type a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give me a rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to give me as many stars
as you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, 94 people have given me a
five-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read the most recent reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn down this music so I can
hear myself think a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these reviews go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by a person who calls
himself My Jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was left on January 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like their Instagram name is
Warpath Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best podcast out for Colorado
culture and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, you are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up and stay irey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, My Jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought it was a competition or
anything, but it sounds like if there were
[SPEAKER_00]: a competition, I would be winning because
you called me the best and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I will keep killing it and I will
always stay irey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do the same, My Jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next review comes from somebody who
calls themselves Grimbold the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a little bit on Instagram
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddy, good seeing you on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, Rasta Man, you can call me
Grimbold if you want to read this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I already called you Grimbold the
Druid because I read your name out loud,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first started listening to this
show a long time ago, you and White Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: always said to tell a friend about the
show if you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronic Coby was that friend for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me realize I really owed you a
review for all the content I've enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to update you guys on that,
on the last episode, when I read the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, I read a review from somebody
who called themselves Chronic Coby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently that was Grimbold the
Druid's buddy who introduced him or who he
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, thanks for sharing the podcast
and thanks for remembering to leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: review after your buddy did so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says show review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely still one of my favorite
podcasts to listen to even a few years in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always look forward to waking up to a
new episode on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: In depth, step-by-step information,
unbiased, solid show.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt about it has increased my
knowledge and abilities as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work on Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of great compliments in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite podcast, one of your favorite
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope Joe Rogan and Joey Diaz are right
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks forward to waking up soon on
Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I put it out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want you to have a fresh new
episode on Mondays because Mondays do kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least my podcast is some light at the
end of that crappy Monday tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In depth, step-by-step information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like I'm a little too in
depth and too step-by-step, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to paint a really good picture
and I have to talk both of us through what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you enjoy the in-depth
step-by-step part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says unbiased, solid show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm biased, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be fair, but I do have my own
opinions and feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'm not afraid to let them
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share my opinions and feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate that you think I'm
unbiased and fair, but sometimes I do put
[SPEAKER_00]: my own, it's my show, so I can say
whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do put my opinion into it quite
often, but thank you for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt about it has increased my
knowledge and abilities as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be a better activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be more informed and
more comfortable with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Grimble the Druid, dude, thanks for the
great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also ends his review with keep it up on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're not following me on
Instagram, you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics,
I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, ireygenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into cannabis photography,
you would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm trying to make the iPad
close this review and open up the next
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird when I say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Johnny Snipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever you put in parentheses
there doesn't show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows a parentheses and an F and I
can't read the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if there's more than I'm
supposed to read Johnny Snipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I keep fucking saying that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently found your podcast because of
Mary's Motivations on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Mary's Motivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should follow Mary's Motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually just released a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have a better shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna press pause and get that correct
information right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I found the correct
webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just marysmotivation.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to marysmotivation.com and listen to my
friend Brett's new podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not feel threatened by sharing other
cannabis related podcasts with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett and I have a very different approach
to cannabis and podcasting, but we agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other wholeheartedly and we're
very good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing but love and respect for
Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett, I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this,
but you guys go check him out on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, Mary's Motivations or Mary's
Motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if the S is on there or not
and marysmotivation.com and check out his
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to Johnny Snipes' review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that timed out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you know Brett also because
Brett's a ray of sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said, I loved the drying and
curing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helped me understand the process
more living in Colorado and the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very difficult to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that drying cure episode will have to
be adjusted everywhere you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be something you're gonna have
to monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying and curing are totally different
from California to Colorado to Maine to
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, Oregon to whatever, Phoenix,
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be different everywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you're able to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, another favorite was the HC,
HTFSE episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, thanks for your
knowledge Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm glad you said that because I
already shared your name at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, you wanted more about my
opinion on sauce versus butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sauce is usually when you mix a little
bit of HCFSE with a little bit of HTFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, which is kind of what the
ambrosia is from apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mixing it, pre mixing it for you
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this I'm not completely, they keep
everything a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not give you information,
but this is from paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did say that their batters were
whipped ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they advertise ambrosia batter,
it's just their ambrosia that they took
[SPEAKER_00]: and whipped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, but you said butter, which could
be kind of, it's all about that texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the sauce is hard to fuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times when I'm dabbing in a
confined space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I try not to say I'm dabbing in the
car, but everybody fucking knows I dab in
[SPEAKER_00]: the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Mike, sometimes I dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I dab in the car and the saucy
shit is hard to fuck with in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just easier for me to have some
butter or some batter or some shatter for
[SPEAKER_00]: the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mainly why I like a different
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love the crystals and I do love the
turps, but it's not necessary to go that
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought some, some batter and some
sugar and it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The batter will be easier should I decide
to partake in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you guys, I know the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes life doesn't always allow for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not always a safe place to
medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the parking lot at the Indo Expo
parked with my keys in my pocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: not driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no place to medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to be at the Indo Expo for about 10
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I medicated in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that type of situation, I would
prefer something that's not goopy and
[SPEAKER_00]: saucy and that I'm not going to spill in
the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it's not as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Batter, I can just put the batter on the
dabber and dab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter, I can actually break off a piece
of shatter and drop it in the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's mostly about ease when it
comes to that point, but the butters
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the saucy stuff, the sauce is cool
if you have something easier to dab it
[SPEAKER_00]: with and you're at home and you got all
your supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on the move, that batter
stuff, that's the only reason I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, let's fucking dab either one
you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the, I like the crystals a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just hard to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I do it, I usually buy a gram
of the batter and a gram of the high
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid full spectrum extract
crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a little bit, no, I put a lot of the
batter on the dabber and then I break up
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the crystals and roll the batter
dabber into the crystals so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: collects it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a sugar donut or a sugar
cookie or a powder donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I thought I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I dab that together that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I like them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sauce, the sauce is just turps in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it saucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're overdoing those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds fucking ridiculous,
but I don't need it that turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns my sinuses when there's too much
turps in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like them both equally, but for ease,
I go for the batter with the crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to wait for another
episode, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got like a combo move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to leave a review and you got to
ask a question at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a air combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five star rating also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is one more that I'd like to read
on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on Thursday by a person
who goes by the name of Rogers1023 on
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they gave me five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm clicking more so it'll enlarge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, just like all the good books
out there, including all the Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowenfeld's teaming books, your stories
and insight helped me in so many ways for
[SPEAKER_00]: first time growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thumbs up to your guests also for all the
info they share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thumbs up to Jesse too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the info he shares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you enjoyed the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad being a grower with a lot of
experience and someone who thinks very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and talks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to remember to include the new
growers in my rents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to remember that not everybody has
been growing for a hundred years in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I have not lost the new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I keep it interesting for the
experience growers and I'm glad I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: losing the new guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hitting my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment without even
realizing that you're giving me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks for the great review and
thank you for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said thumbs up to Jesse and
my friends for all the info he shares.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to also thank Frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to thank Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to thank everybody that's ever been
on the podcast, especially white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes and spends a lot of time over
here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just Jesse, but or myself,
but big thumbs up to everybody that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show and all the people that I do
have lined up to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got somebody that I asked them to be
on the show to talk about lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple other growers and
breeders lined up to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to create the time and maybe
get over the anxiety of getting new people
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show and get them on here and bring
the content to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five stars and a huge
compliments without even realizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that was all the
iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody that left me a new
iTunes review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for rating and review and also
thank you to everybody who has left one in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really helps the podcast move in the
rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more reviews we get, the more exposure
we get in iTunes, which means more people
[SPEAKER_00]: will see the show, which means more people
will listen, which means more people will
[SPEAKER_00]: join us in the fight to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also more people will join us in
growing quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want is everybody to be
able to grow the best cannabis they can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, let's move
forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the throwback Thursday
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that listen to the podcast
and have been listening for a while know
[SPEAKER_00]: that every Thursday I put out what is
called a throwback Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go grab old episodes and I put them in
blocks of three and I let them out on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday so that you guys can get old
content back into the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am caught up on throwback Thursday
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was making episodes, I realized the
next episode in my feed is a throwback
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday episode, which tells me I am
caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to figure out something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to promise content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Thursday, I will continue to bring
you new episodes every single Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to do random things on
Thursdays until I figure out what I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to promise you a whole new
episode every Thursday, but I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to commit to that just yet because it does
take a lot of time to put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now I am simply at the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take more projects right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to eliminate some shit to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I eliminate will make room for
better podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I'd like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear my plate to get more time to do more
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got to figure out another
Thursday plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just put out random episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just talk about random shit that
doesn't qualify for a Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet,
but Thursday, if an episode doesn't pop
[SPEAKER_00]: out, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we're all caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let a few episodes go, maybe put
another 100 or another 50 episodes out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the feed and then start doing the
throwback Thursday episodes again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to set anything in stone,
but I promise you the Monday episodes will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for old episodes,
they are on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 150 are on YouTube and I am
putting out more episodes as time goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm slightly overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do eliminate some things,
I will make time for more podcasting and
[SPEAKER_00]: more YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we covered Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: When an episode doesn't come out Thursday,
please don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't blow up my inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the support, but we're going
to start skipping Thursdays for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to promise what's going to
happen, but we may skip a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't freak out if that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hi Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for being the incredible
human being that you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to read any or all of this on
the air, including my name and the PS's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of your amazing energy,
detailed cultivation knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: industry updates, life wisdom,
and all of the goodness you share on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, that's huge, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be in a positive good mood when I
read the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detailed cultivation knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, sometimes a little too
detailed, I feel like, but I'm glad that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay on top of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just old, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also says, and all of the
goodness you share on the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paragraphs like that make it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also goes on to say, I'm thrilled to
support you on Patreon with a $4.20
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me mention Patreon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you want to contribute to
a podcast financially, Patreon is the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to patreon.com slash Grow From Your
Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information that you need to
sign up for Patreon will be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be contributing financially to
the podcast, which will help me keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: website alive, which is where I host the
podcast for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps me get these microphone
covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to need a new MacBook Pro here
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that come from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would like to contribute,
patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email I'm reading right now,
I don't know if he wants me to say his
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say if I can say his name,
but our friend just contributed $4.20 per
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the huge contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, I really
appreciate how you cover so much Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your theory on airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a recent episode I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also dive into legalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: politics and how people are affected and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he said that he loves how I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dive into legalities, politics,
how people are affected and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to Cheryl and Jeremy at
Love for the Plant for sharing their
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with discrimination and for
teaching us about their Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It meant a lot to me and my heart goes out
to them and the many people globally
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with discrimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big thank you to Cheryl and
Jeremy for sharing their story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did share some personal stories on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't listen to that one,
go check out the podcast titled Love for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Plant and you'll know what our friend
here is talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the email goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a super important question
slash topic that I am not sure you have
[SPEAKER_00]: covered recently, which is cultivation
software, seed to sale tracking apps,
[SPEAKER_00]: other Grow apps, and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I'm super proud to share that
I've joined the industry as an interface
[SPEAKER_00]: designer with Flourish Software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making the shift from other industries to
the cannabis movement has made me very
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving what you do and being passionate
about the movement you're doing it for is
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible combination, perhaps one of
the best in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that feeling and I get to see
people enter the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched it develop and I've been into it
since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it before I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see a lot of my trim crew,
a lot of my crew that works with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two dudes from Texas and
sometimes the look on their faces is just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forget that I forget that feeling of
being new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's great seeing people move from
Texas where they were oppressed and afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: to come here to get to walk into a room
filled with 300 plants that are six feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall and just filled with buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smile on their face is fucking
amazing every time to me still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know the feeling that you're getting
being in the industry that you love and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what you love to do and being
passionate about your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does put something different into your
day when you actually care about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't care about my job,
everything would be totally different in
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't give a shit to take care of
myself because I wouldn't need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't rest well because I wouldn't
need to be sharp with my mind to do a good
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't have this career path,
I don't know what I would have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been a musician and I'd
probably be in not such good mental or
[SPEAKER_00]: physical health if I were still on the
road with the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, as I've come on board with
Flourish, there are tons of apps popping
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the landscape of options is evolving
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am curious, what cultivation software do
you use at the commercial grow you run?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is, have you heard great
things about any other grow software out
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third question is, is any of the
cultivation software you've used or heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about missing features that would make it
amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also ask for any software to
avoid or anything else you can think of
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cultivation software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Colorado, we are required to use
the Marijuana Enforcement Division's
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking system known as METRIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's M-E-T-R-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember exactly what that stands
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Marijuana Enforcement Tracking R-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the R tracking and
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, METRIC, M-E-T-R-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is required to use METRIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant is put into METRIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at a facility on Instagram,
if you look at the pictures, you see those
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow or blue tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are METRIC tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow are for medical marijuana
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue are for recreational cannabis
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those are called METRIC tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those plants is in a program
called METRIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all get an RFID number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the minute I cut a clone, I write down
the mother plant RFID number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my mother plant is, I'm just going
to say plant number 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down plant number 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut 50 clones of Durban poison,
plant number 5,000 on February 10th into
[SPEAKER_00]: this dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those get entered into METRIC as new
clones that came from a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get potted into soil,
they get moved from clone to vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now a veg plant and they get a
tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are RFID tagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get their own number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now those plants have a mother plant
number that they came from and a date in
[SPEAKER_00]: which they were created and a batch
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they move into a small plant with its
own individual tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tag will stay with that plant until
it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I move it to flower, I have to go
to that plant and find that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually tag it in the computer that has
been moved into the flowering stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: mark which flower room I have moved it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I kill that plant before it's
harvested, I have to take that plant tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do this honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike does this at the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the METRIC part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I kill that tag, I take that tag to
Mike and Mike enters it in the computer as
[SPEAKER_00]: a dead plant and has to give a full
sentence reason as to why it got killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't just type in dead or ugly or died
or male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to type in like several words.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask for more words to explain why
that plant is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody is using METRIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in Colorado, I know there are
other states using METRIC because I see
[SPEAKER_00]: their customer support on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I haven't paid attention because
I haven't needed to, but I know other
[SPEAKER_00]: states are using METRIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, what other software do we use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a lot of Google Docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say Google Docs really funny when I'm
stoned, but Google has a docs program that
[SPEAKER_00]: is very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to diss your software, but Google Docs
does almost between METRIC and Google
[SPEAKER_00]: Docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do almost everything we need done
and they're reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Docs, I'm just going to fucking
keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that I can update a document right
now and in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's at his house bouncing Davey on his
knee watching fucking cartoons and he can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at his computer in live real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch me update a Google document so we
can update inventory sheets and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: share those with all my management,
with whoever and that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Google Docs and METRIC are mainly what
we use in the commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use another app called Basecamp,
which is just a communications app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like a forum that's
private.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only members of my facility are allowed to
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm in other groups to where there's
a management group, a cultivation group,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an HR group, and then another group
that's like a private group that only a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of us are in for like secret
conversations so that if we have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: an email conversation that we don't need
other people in, only the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: checked off in that group can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so Basecamp, METRIC, and Google Docs
are mainly what we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other software that I've really
played with was old stuff like MMJ Menu
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't have enough plant movement
stuff and enough plant data stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I have played with was
the Smart B controller setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not give me any plant data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only room data, but they have a
light temperature and humidity sensor that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me a lot of data that helps me
adjust my rooms a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell me second by second real time
information, the humidity, the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, how much light is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are sensors that tell me how wet or
dry my medium is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Smart B setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they had some operating
errors in my facility and I sent them
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not work for me and my facility and
what we were trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't work for what we were
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use your Smart B system
for a home grow or a medium size grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow was too large and the devices
could not connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing against Smart B
controllers, just not the units for my
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I heard any great things about any
other software out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't pay attention enough to
grow software.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay more attention to genetics,
nutrients, lighting, HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should pay more attention to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a pen and paper kind of a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that seems weird, but I like
writing pencil to paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a dry erase board that's filled
with notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pocket full of notes all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the pen to paper kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I remember stuff and my brain
absorbs it more and remembers it more if I
[SPEAKER_00]: write something down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does something to my storage for my
brain a little bit better when I put the
[SPEAKER_00]: pen to paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not be the guy to talk about grow
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, between Metric and Google Docs,
I think I've got everything covered,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you asked me some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that I've used or heard
missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, Metric sucks because it is used by
every facility and dispensary in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow, if you've got a
processing plant, if you make edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you make extractions, if you have a
dispensary, if you have a delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: company, if you're doing anything in
Colorado with a marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: division regulated facility, you have to
be on Metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will freeze and you get that spinning
wheel of, fuck you, Metric death.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just turns and turns and turns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've walked into the office and literally
found Mike smacking his head into the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer screen and I go, what are you
doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, just watching Metric fucking
spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I walked downstairs and my phone
will ring and it'll be Jenny and she'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works at a dispensary also and I don't
know her exact title and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it wrong or I would tell you what she
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like a manager and a whole bunch of
other things at a dispensary and I'll call
[SPEAKER_00]: her and I'll be like, what you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she'll be like, I'm watching this
fucking wheel on Metric just spin around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the cultivation guy, I don't have
to mess with that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am blessed, but something I have heard
that is missing is shit that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metric seems to take for fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to design something and
make it nationally used, make it to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it works when a lot of people get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now you can look on Facebook
sometimes during the middle of the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see everybody in Colorado bitching
about Metric being frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Metric freezes, it slows down
business and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody and it actually costs us
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had delivery drivers sitting in the
lobby of my facility for an hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for Metric to load.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can simply print the manifest that
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds stupid, but you can't
leave the facility with 50 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: product without the proper paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a signed copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a signed copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll say, why didn't you print it
before?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't print it before because sometimes
these guys show up in a different car than
[SPEAKER_00]: last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to have their license plate
number, their ID number, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: shit changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easier just to print it when they
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you print it before,
I guarantee fucking to you something has
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make stuff that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any software to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying, I haven't used enough
to give you any idea on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like your last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you can think of related to
cultivation software?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that I don't know if
you're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't looked at your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your designs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it look like a cheesy video
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put any hippie theme shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put Rasta themed shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No red, yellow, and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: No rainbows.
[SPEAKER_00]: No tie dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a computer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it pleasing to the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please don't make it a cartoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it a video game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it really hokey that everything
cannabis related is also hippie and Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that shit goes hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Rasta man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your computer program doesn't have to
be also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give people the option to have
different skins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can have the the serious skin,
the calculator skin, the science skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the tie dyed one and the Rasta
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't make that like the default.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it cheesy in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it hokey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spent less time coloring it up to
appeal to hippies and Rastas and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: made a computer program that appealed to
tech people and people trying to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: data, it would be more efficient in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just voicing concerns off the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see a program that I can
enter what strain I grew, how many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, what each harvest weight was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that'll keep tabs on like
averages for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can just keep tabs on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe the next harvest,
I could do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew 20 platinum tangy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant weighed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average of that plant was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average waste was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of or the amount of trim
material was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then start let that spreadsheet start
documenting averages for me over different
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would have to input everything
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think our Google Docs are doing
mostly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a manager that does all that
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Greeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greeny is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using software.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called David Greenman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does all that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to David Greenman.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the guys you need to talk to
about software.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want input, those guys are the ones
that have the input like this for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate the question,
but I like I've said a couple of minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, I don't think I'm the guy to ask
about the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the guy with my fingers in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the guy getting dirty writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a clipboard, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as much on the computer as I
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write it down on paper and then pass it
on to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mike sends it in an email to
Greeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Greeny does the spreadsheet part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greeny is my software.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your email goes on to say,
and this credible day using technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: software to assist growing cannabis is a
no brainer for business and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: when dealing with different state
compliance regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is definitely a no brainer for the
business end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a no brainer for my growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do use Google Docs for like sheets
of lists of things to do for my grow tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it for scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it for nutrient charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it for inventory, but I am not into
the computer as much as a lot of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of old school, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying I like pen to paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pencil on paper is my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology and computing is a no brainer
for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: My general manager, one of my general
managers of the dispensary and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and we talk about strains
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is flow living up to our expectations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the testing reaching the numbers we
needed to reach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the harvest weight reaching the harvest
weight we needed to reach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it producing enough per square foot
compared to other plants to keep it around
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many hours are we spending on trimming
each strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does some strains take way longer to trim
than others?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many hours are we spending trimming
per pound?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is our cost of trimming per pound?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is our... So there are so many things
like that we think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, using technology and software is
crucial in any business, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis business, since it's so new and
there's so much to keep track of and you
[SPEAKER_00]: are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I'm not the dude to ask
about that, but I did my best with your
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you contributed to Patreon and I
promised to answer all these Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, I did my best, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you some useful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's using metric in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't make it look like a video game
and don't make it hippie themed and Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: themed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll be taken more seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the email says, I was also
curious if you'll be attending NCIA's
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming Seed to Sale show in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there with the team and I would
love to get a chance to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since that was this weekend,
no, I did not make that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was this weekend or the end of
this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'll go to the Seed to
Sale show, but let me know the next event
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to in Denver and I will try
to make it up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking snow and still, so I wouldn't
have gone this weekend either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends the email with, thank you,
much love and gratitude, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signs his name, Michael Patrick
Goss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Patrick Goss, thank you for a
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for contributing to the cannabis
industry by trying to create a software
[SPEAKER_00]: that is more user friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it user friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make us have to search for tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an Apple guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it look more like Apple products than
Microsoft products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsoft products piss me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple stuff seems to flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it flow like an Apple product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, PS, another awesome topic to
bring up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept of donating $4.20 to advocates
like yourself, organizations, and
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians so that they get the signal
loud and clear to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't know where this started,
but for a few months now, there has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign going amongst cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever said that I'm a
cannabis activist, but I guess I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a voice for cannabis, but something
going on amongst us cannabis supporters
[SPEAKER_00]: and advocates is we are trying to get our
supporters to contribute to our
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's another podcast out there or
another cannabis educator or supporter
[SPEAKER_00]: that you wholeheartedly support,
I would appreciate it if you donate $4.20
[SPEAKER_00]: to their Patreon campaign and let them
know why you're doing it, that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying it forward from the grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even mention me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say, hey, I heard that it would be
kind to donate $4.20 to my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis speaker, lecturer, educator,
podcaster, musician, whatever they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing for cannabis, be it normal,
be it a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's Mary's motivations podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go throw down, throw them a $4 and 20
cent contribution and let them know that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because you support them and you
support the legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to mention my show,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking you to, I don't need the
kickback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the notice, but I think that
if my listeners went through four 20 at
[SPEAKER_00]: another place, that would be helpful
because I've been getting a lot of $4 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 cent contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody said something about me
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm paying it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donate $4 and 20 cents to somebody that
you feel supports cannabis in a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: light, somebody that you support and that
you respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says P or PPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it PSS or PPS?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's post post script.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the meaning of your brand's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics after I heard you explain
the meaning of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on a throwback Thursday episode,
I was sledding in the snow with my son
[SPEAKER_00]: later that day, smiling wide as I observed
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silence was only interrupted by the
welcoming sound of the calm wind flowing
[SPEAKER_00]: over my ears and the crunch of his boots
in the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment felt phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps nothing in the universe could have
been better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have an Iri moment at any point of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids always bring an Iri feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of weather and some children
will put an Iri feeling in your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not sure what Iri is,
Iri means a lot of things, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a patois word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri just means feeling as blessed as you
could feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as maybe you're on,
there used to be, I grew up in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was a park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the exact park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Crothers Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little hill by the playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tiny hill, but I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a big fucking hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little grassy hill with a tree at
the top of it by the playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just lay on my back on that hill and
just look up into the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else was doing, I live in a bad
neighborhood, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fucked up area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else was out doing bad people,
crazy kid shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was laying on the grass, staring up into
the clouds, just feeling this feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was feeling Iri and I didn't even know
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about Iri, just think
about you're sitting on a grassy hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass is nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a warm day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that grass feels good on your butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good on your leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel the earth underneath you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like not wet, but it's like cold and
soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got that cool grass under your
butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough breeze to not piss you off,
but just enough to not make it hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can feel some wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that there's nature and wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dragonfly flying around over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is hitting you, but from an angle
to where it doesn't even make you squint,
[SPEAKER_00]: just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun feels just, just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun's kind of setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're sitting in the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun's kind of setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature's fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dragonfly flying over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got your dog next to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing in your heart's bugging you,
but everything just feels, ah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fucking Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basic Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be at a reggae concert and you
could be feeling that vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only got your arms stretched out on
the steering wheel and you lean a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit into the song and your shoulders do
that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are feeling Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your hips wobble back and forth to
the music, you're feeling Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri can be a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri is the most powerful, most blessed,
most fucking great feeling you can feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call my seed company Iri Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you consume my cannabis, you're gonna
feel Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you enjoyed the word Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate the brand name and
I'm extra glad that you sent me a really
[SPEAKER_00]: long email with two PS's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize that I'm not the tech savvy
computer guy that you were hoping for,
[SPEAKER_00]: which seems weird because I run a podcast
with all kinds of knobs and buttons here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've dumbed this down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy at this point, but Michael Patrick
Goss, I appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for trying to make some software
for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to check out your website and
then I will have Mike and Greenie check
[SPEAKER_00]: out your website too and see if there's
any software there that may help us out at
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensary or at the Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's something that helps us,
I will talk about that on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to
send me an email for me to read it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to read your email on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I've been talking
for over 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is getting dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to start wrapping up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do that, I want to give some
shout outs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Roger
S, Brett C, Kloss V and Michael Zartarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big ass stack of emails I need to
get through and I've got a bunch more
[SPEAKER_00]: content that I like to share with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to everybody joining me
on the next Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder, I do not know what's
going to happen on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If another episode doesn't come out,
don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure something out real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you guys for listening to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all the support,
all the interaction, all the messages,
[SPEAKER_00]: emails, all the Instagram love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year has been off to a great start
with podcasting, with social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: with my companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody for
supporting me who's had my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow me on all of the social
media, check me out on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply search for the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I re underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me some tweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GF Y H podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something to say and you're
not into all the social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear what you've got to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I've got some old
episodes up on YouTube and I am working on
[SPEAKER_00]: catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it takes fucking ever to get
those videos up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes it like three hours to load a
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do anything else with my computer
while that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can only happen when I don't need
my computer and I've got time to set it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually before I go to work in the
morning, I'll set it up to load up a video
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll take off and come home and
the video will be loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, YouTube videos are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reminded you about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would truly appreciate your Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks, simply go to patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out how to sign up to become a

[SPEAKER_00]: They will cover everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everybody that listens.

[SPEAKER_00]: Or just keep listening and I still love
you either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do your best to support cannabis in a
positive light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be an embarrassing pothead and don't
spread false information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see somebody doing something
stupid with cannabis in public or in
[SPEAKER_00]: private, point it out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct that shit if you're that kind of
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make cannabis a mainstream thing
that nobody is afraid of anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I want to thank
everybody for listening to episode 287 of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with brand new
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my boy,
Firm Deli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and silent through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and silent through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and silent through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to keep her out of sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and silent through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a pot's the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find nothing wrong with being
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes she lets me use the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't find nothing wrong with
your mind, you better find something wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I began to try to explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just wasn't, just wasn't what it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if I can't find something to do with
my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're silent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, lord, now I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get away clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and silent through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a pot's the queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to talk, double talk, double talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trouble talk, catching myself alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch myself alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama, come look at me just like I was mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't leave the valentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I began to try to explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just wasn't, just wasn't what it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if I can't find something to do with
my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and through the alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneak and silent through the alley.
Sneak
and silent through the alley.
