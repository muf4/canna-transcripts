[SPEAKER_00]: and of course I did include that link in
the show notes and in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description To make it super easy for all

[SPEAKER_00]: Really you guys Thank you for all of that
continued patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I wanted to do something rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do this on the podcast a lot I
used to talk about what I do all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to talk about going to comedy shows
I used to talk about going to concerts
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get to do that kind of shit
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing some Netflix saying
what did I watch on Netflix?
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently watched a documentary about the
Cecil Hotel To be really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just say that that was a four hour
show that could have been 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you jump in too far the Cecil
Hotel all of the answers are in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 minutes of the show everything you
needed to know was told to you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning you could put the whole damn
story together watch it if you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested but Man four hours of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have been recording podcasts or
doing something way different That shit
[SPEAKER_00]: could have been a 45 maybe an hour and 15
at the most There was a lot of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: content that did not need to be in there
long story could have been a really short
[SPEAKER_00]: story That's my review on the Cecil Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The new discord link in the last episode I
mentioned that there were some epa some
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrades to the irie genetics irie army
discord We've gotten our own Vanity
[SPEAKER_00]: discord link.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right instead of saying it out loud
right here I'll just put it in the show
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and in the description you guys can
go ahead and just click on that That'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take you right to the discord join the
irie army irie genetics grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast Discord gang there's a lot
of cool shit going on over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't honestly I don't participate
enough in the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot Going on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of other things happen So big
thanks to the people that do make the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord happen and who are on the discord
But when I pop in there, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chat rooms happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are video chats happening There are
conversations about growing happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are auctions There are all kinds of
great crazy anything you can think of that
[SPEAKER_00]: may happen in an online community It's
probably happening in the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great time a great place to go meet
new members of the irie army it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: place for the irie army and the DGC to
kind of mesh together right there So a big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to everybody over there holding
it down in the discord Also, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely random.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just heard it through my headphones a
moment ago Don't know if you guys can hear
[SPEAKER_00]: it There are some cats in my neighborhood
and I don't know if they are making babies
[SPEAKER_00]: or having babies But they're right over
there just a little bit I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: identified exactly where I think it's out
of my yard, but the yard next to me behind
[SPEAKER_00]: me ish There are some cats over there
either Making kittens or having kittens or
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar or maybe I should go
check further But I'm pretty sure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cats doing cat things over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it comes through the headphones,
there's nobody There's nobody tied up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing weird is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are cats I've been hearing
it randomly for a little bit this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want I want to believe that those
are cats making that noise I'm starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder what it really is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have brought that up Anyway,
those are cats if it comes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone you guys I I'm gonna do we're
gonna stick that That's my story and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're making making more kittens
over there It's what it sounds like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I did say at the start of
the show I was going to answer some grow
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to that part So we don't
have to talk about cats making kittens
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore Let's get right to the grow
question part This one came from my email
[SPEAKER_00]: inbox and it came from I'm looking to see
if they want their name said They did not
[SPEAKER_00]: give me a name to use So I'm not gonna
give them a their name said but shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to you You'll know who you are when I read
your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes just alike at this It says hey
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started listening to your podcast
and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said I'm not sure if you've been asked
or answered this before but What are your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on curing with humidity packs and
he actually listed a brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said Boveda There are several brands of
humidity packs available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to endorse or bash or
promote or belittle any Particular brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my overall opinion on the humidity
packs, which are used to preserve Dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: cure originally were for cigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're used in the cannabis industry
quite a bit But let's talk about how I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel about Boveda packs I don't really
find it necessary to use a Boveda pack if
[SPEAKER_00]: you dry it and cured your product properly
in the beginning That does take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of experience to get to that point So
maybe if you're using it as a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a training wheel for drying and curing
that's acceptable I don't need a Boveda
[SPEAKER_00]: pack to dry and cure my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessary but It's
helpful if it's working for you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop doing something just because
Rasta Jeff doesn't do it I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's necessary I think and this is my
opinion Mike seems to agree with me a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people have argued some people agree with
me Sometimes I think if you cure with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Boveda pack in there it gives it sort of a
moist Different flavor that you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: in the finished product if you wait until
the product is properly Dried and cured
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're preserving that moisture level
with the Boveda pack then it will Works
[SPEAKER_00]: well and it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's necessary for
actually drying and curing the product I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's better for long-term storage
and for preserving the freshness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: project product once you've got it like
stored for a while Maybe more long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage not drying and curing is what I'm
trying to say then also my opinion has
[SPEAKER_00]: Widely varied and swayed back and forth
over time when it comes to the Boveda and
[SPEAKER_00]: other brand humidity packs I've said
before that I think it kind of leaves a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird flavor it kind of and I could that
could be completely full of shit Maybe it
[SPEAKER_00]: was something else in the grow doing that
But I feel like it was making the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: taste different when we quit using the
Boveda packs the herb tasted better in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion Now we do I do live in Colorado
where I experience what is known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado crunch if I go buy If I buy an
eighth or an ounce of weed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary It's going to be crunchy
because the dispensary weed is stored in a
[SPEAKER_00]: jar on the shelf to where everybody can
see it that comes in the budtender grabs
[SPEAKER_00]: it Sets it out in front of you you smell
it or maybe not now during kovat But
[SPEAKER_00]: during most times you'd smell it and then
they open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pop off the lid They weigh out either
an eighth or they weigh out at a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe your ounce if that's what you're
buying Maybe two ounces if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: hard then they put the lid back on it and
they put it back on the shelf Maybe they
[SPEAKER_00]: popped open three or four other jars and
showed you all of those at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening with every customer that
comes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that weed is getting super dry If they
put that herb back in a big container at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the night with the Boveda
package and sealed it up Or maybe just put
[SPEAKER_00]: some Boveda packs in that jar that may
prevent that Colorado crispiness That may
[SPEAKER_00]: be a good use for the Boveda pack there so
if you're slow drying it and slow curing
[SPEAKER_00]: it Get it as close as you can to perfect
then add the Boveda pack if you mess it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it too dry Then that's when I
would say to read to reintroduce that
[SPEAKER_00]: Boveda pack and re moisten the product at
that time But I think if you're doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you don't really need the Boveda
pack if you've got Enough product to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you think you may need to store it with
the pack I'm not gonna like I said earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like it do it Maybe get a small jar
and try it with the Boveda pack in a small
[SPEAKER_00]: jar and try it without I think if you dry
it and cure it properly and you get a big
[SPEAKER_00]: jar that you keep your like personal stash
in put a couple of packs in there just to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that one long-term fresh then however
often you takes you to smoke and ate the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed take an eighth out of your big jar
put it in your smaller jar and make that
[SPEAKER_00]: one the jar that you pop open and open and
Close all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your big storage jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your smaller jar that way your big
jar stays fresh It's not getting cracked
[SPEAKER_00]: open all the time Then you got your
smaller one that does get open and closed
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time when you're reaching for a
nug Maybe even put a Boveda pack in with
[SPEAKER_00]: that eighth maybe a quarter depending on
how hard you smoke But you asked mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: about curing thoughts on curing with
Boveda humidity packs I would prefer dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and cure without it use a dialed-in room
use jars use a humidifier and a
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier use a heater and an air
conditioner use Those things for your
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing and then once it's in
the jar trimmed up Just getting that final
[SPEAKER_00]: touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can add the Boveda is in
my opinion I don't want to bash the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bash the company many
people love them I just think if it's done
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, you don't need them until it
comes to that long-term storage That's
[SPEAKER_00]: when they do come in very handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prevent you from getting that
Colorado crunch So put your big jar put a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of Boveda packs in the big jar and
then if you've got some bud that you did
[SPEAKER_00]: get from the dispenser Three that came and
it showed up all crispy and crunchy throw
[SPEAKER_00]: in a couple of Boveda packs in there that
will help Remoisten and stabilize that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I rambled on long enough about the
Boveda packs I do have some friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: have a podcast They did do the Boveda
challenge where they put some dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured herbs into two different jars one
with the Boveda one without and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: tell the difference the one with it was a
little Moisture moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a word it is now because I said it
right somebody put that in the in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dictionary moisture It was more Moist one
bud was more moist more supple it burned a
[SPEAKER_00]: little differently The other had that
Colorado crunch effect that I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just hear it go If you broke it up
by the microphone it burned really quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't get to taste that herb so I
can't testify to the flavor visually
[SPEAKER_00]: Audibly it did look and appear and sound
like better product, but I didn't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it so I can't testify much to that
but the quick summary drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need it storage or Re, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remoistening is the word we're gonna use
That is when I would use the Boveda packs
[SPEAKER_00]: got awful rambling on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a long show the next
question Oh, by the way, that question
[SPEAKER_00]: came from my email box my email in back
inbox My email address is holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard to say my email address is
grow from your heart at hotmail.com Since
[SPEAKER_00]: I put so much effort into it, please use
that email address Send me your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: questions this question came from the grow
help tab On my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is I read genetics comm on that
website You will find a tab that says grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help if you click on that grow help tab,
you can ask grow questions We ask you a
[SPEAKER_00]: few preliminary questions just to kind of
give me an idea of what's going on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow then at the bottom it says The
problem and that's where you are given the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to tell me about the problem
in your grow Then I will read that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and we will diagnose or recommend
some solutions for your problem That's
[SPEAKER_00]: where this question came from They want me
to use the name T dot 420 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one came from T dot 420 T dot 420
is growing cookies kush from Barney's farm
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing washing machine from
ripper seeds and one smoothie auto by 42
[SPEAKER_00]: fast buds and it was a sample seed a Lot
of these details are not necessary because
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's skip some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you feeding it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding it Remo nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's Ramo or Remo
nutrients, but shout out Ramo Ramo is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool-ass dude up there in Canada growing
with the Ramo nutrients using five mils of
[SPEAKER_00]: micro five mils of grow five mils of Velo
kelp eight mils of Magnific al that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like a fucking great name for a product
for the Cal Mag product five mils of
[SPEAKER_00]: nature's candy I can imagine that that's
like a sweetener and five eight
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of microbial mass and it says
it's the first time I'll continue to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this once every two weeks Then it says a
little more about the growth Which isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have a small question here since
I'm starting the microbial mass Should I
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the dosage indicated on the bottle
or should I reduce it to half as I have
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of my nutrients like you suggest
in your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your time I really
am learning a lot from you watching your
[SPEAKER_00]: videos reminds me of my chef when I was an
apprentice There's a lot of stuff there in
[SPEAKER_00]: that last fucking sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you I do appreciate that it makes me
feel good It makes it worth my time
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that you are learning a lot The
time that I put into this the energy the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment the effort is worth it because
you're learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot Reminds me of when you
were of your chef when you were the
[SPEAKER_00]: apprentice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be the grasshopper I'll be mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyagi.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you want to do it as long as
you're learning bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep teaching I'm glad you're
following along now Let's get past the wax
[SPEAKER_00]: on wax off portion and let's talk about
the recommendation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are using a microbial product Called
microbial mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little quick research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little bit expensive It's got a
lot of fancy microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's packaged up very well as long as it
is not too expensive I would probably use
[SPEAKER_00]: that product as recommended I do recommend
most the time that you use most products
[SPEAKER_00]: at about half to three quarters of the
recommended strength So if it says use a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred I say start with 50 see how it
responds then try 75 see how it responds
[SPEAKER_00]: you rarely have to go all the way Up to a
hundred percent of what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have faith in the companies
which we choose to work with but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the business of doing business their
business is you buying more nutrients if
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get you to splash on just a few
extra milliliters a Few times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that much sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy that many more bottles So
if they can get you to use it more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, they certainly will and they're
not in your grow They don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing how you're growing when
you're growing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are recommendations I would start
with About half of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your plants are gonna fucking thrive
a lot of plants respond better with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of nutrients when you start
putting more on you start seeing what the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients do not what the plant does and I
like to see what my plants do then adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: my nutrients to that so in most cases I
would recommend starting with about 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the recommended dosage on the bottle then
work your way up maybe to 75 maybe 80
[SPEAKER_00]: You're rarely gonna get up to need a
hundred percent of the recommended dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottle I don't know if you guys
hear the weird noises happening in my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, but I'm sorry if I look
distracted momentarily Because I certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly was Well, let's get back on
track You're probably gonna need 50 to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the recommended dosage on the
bottle for the micro products.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, um The other products let me back
up the other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the opportunity the potential
to burn your plants You can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can burn the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can burn the whole damn leaf You can
cause root issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cause lockouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can disrupt the soil and the plant
growth all together With a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products those salty products the chelated
buffered nutrients Can do a lot of damage
[SPEAKER_00]: the micro products I don't really in my
opinion feel like you can overdose on
[SPEAKER_00]: micro products The thing to think about
there is cost-effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you were gonna use it every two
weeks I think I'd like to see it every
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe every once a week if you're gonna
use a micro product I didn't research how
[SPEAKER_00]: often to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, it feels like once a
week is enough to keep those colonies
[SPEAKER_00]: Thriving just to get those microbes
whatever you've got going on once a week
[SPEAKER_00]: get some going if you're using tap water
If you're using filtered water,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your microbes are going to be
destroyed by environmental factors by
[SPEAKER_00]: competition within the root zone Maybe
just by chlorine in your water Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramine in your water a lot of things
are going to be competing and destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: your microbes So maybe if you use a little
bit too much all you're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: supercharging Overpowering the other
things and keeping that micro colony super
[SPEAKER_00]: strong within your rhizosphere So if it is
cost-effective and it's not cutting into
[SPEAKER_00]: your budget if you're still able to afford
the rest of your nutrients and eat like a
[SPEAKER_00]: king and buy Good concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say feed that bad dog that micro
product as Recommended if it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive maybe reduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're gonna do it every two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Again, unless it says to do it every two
weeks I would almost do it every once a
[SPEAKER_00]: week every other micro product I can think
of they recommend doing it once per week
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd read the bottle see if they say
once a week or once every two weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically if you're gonna use the rest of
Remo's instructions the rest of his
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles I would just go with what he
recommends at that recommended level
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've seen Ramos plants and I've
seen what he does and that dude has a
[SPEAKER_00]: kick-ass garden a so Shout-out to Remo and
Remo nutrients if that's the dude then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that makes these nutrients,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be that's the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout-out to Remo Yeah, so just use the
recommended part on that micro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think you'll overdo it I
don't think you'll overdose it and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just be compensating for anything that may
be destroying any of the microbes that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already got going on if it's
Chlorine chloramine or competition within
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone and if you got a bunch of
microbes in there that just prevents you
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting other Bad or other things
which may be bad into that root zone big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my friend t.420 That's his
Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to be called t.420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great great question,
bro I hope I was able to help you out go
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and use that product if it is cost
effective one thing I should add and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not trying to diss on anybody's nutrient
line, but If you do find that maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using a nutrient line and maybe the
microbes from that line are too expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe the enzymes are too expensive or
maybe the Cal Mag is too expensive You
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to always use the full lineup
of one company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use Ramos everything
everything everything Remo if you find
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a more affordable more
cost-effective Microbe product you can
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely swap it out for this microbial
product if it fits your budget your wallet
[SPEAKER_00]: your style your grow better But with that
being said be very careful that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap anything When you're reading the
bottles see what your NPK values are your
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen phosphorus potassium See how much
if there's calcium or magnesium in one
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle Maybe there's boron and copper and
zinc in one bottle make sure you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: overlapping any nutrients in two different
bottles because this company probably put
[SPEAKER_00]: a few Elements in a couple of bottles and
you can mix them up and get the ideal mix
[SPEAKER_00]: but this other company did similarly But
they mixed bottles a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently So you do have the potential
to maybe overlap nitrogen or phosphorus or
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium or calcium it is possible So
it's your responsibility to read those
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles and make sure but as agree as a
grower as a breeder with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience I've talked about using veg
bloom and new millennium at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm also mixing in What's that bloom
booster that I can never remember the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of the one with the bat guano stuff on it
Bud swell there we go too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to stop thinking about And the
name comes to my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also mixing in Bud swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also mixing in Solicium I also mix in
other products that are not new millennium
[SPEAKER_00]: or Veg bloom based so there are other
random products that do go into my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: because they work well with my recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about If even if you give a
professional chef a written recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's gonna go and you said to use this I
want to use this and make it mine because
[SPEAKER_00]: he's the chef and I'm the fucking grower
and I know what results I'm looking for so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to kind of manipulate my feeds
custom tailor my feeds Dial in my feeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: give me exactly what I need for the
outcome Which I need that way it like week
[SPEAKER_00]: three if I say, oh man, I'm running a
little bit low on this I can grab
[SPEAKER_00]: something and I know what to mix in to add
that to make my plants go kapow shebang
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not limited by what this lineup says
to do maybe I only need one element and
[SPEAKER_00]: this all these bottles have Three elements
in each bottle and I just need one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've got a product that's got that
one fucking thing And they're ready
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to add the nitrogen and the
other stuff in there Get that one in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with the other bottle from another brand
Just but be careful if you go doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you guys but don't think that you
have to buy just because you bought One
[SPEAKER_00]: brand of something doesn't mean you have
to stick with that entire lineup It's much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier when you're a beginner grower to do
that But as you get better, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_00]: add some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've said enough into that
Let's keep going with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the cats are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard them in a few minutes
Hopefully I didn't just jinx myself the
[SPEAKER_00]: next Message came from my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: No this one came from patreon this one
came from coach Steve shot it to coach
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve I hear from you a lot Thank you for
supporting the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and the DGC this message goes Just
a like of this it says hey rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've had a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great weekend Thank you,
bro about to have another great weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: not to toot my own horn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about to be my birthday weekend I
think this episode will come out on my
[SPEAKER_00]: birthday So I'll be smoking dabs and
eating cake and having a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you I had a good weekend It says
I just listened to episode 603 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of light leaks And I don't think I
heard you mention a dark period for
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative plants if you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed that Yes, I did talk about light
leaks in depth on a previous episode and I
[SPEAKER_00]: did not talk about Vegetative plants very
much vegetative plants get overlooked
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often We're gonna discuss that here
in just a moment The message goes on to
[SPEAKER_00]: say I do see a lot of growers treating the
dark period in veg with the same rules as
[SPEAKER_00]: flour Can you please mention that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you please mention that during veg you
do not need uninterrupted darkness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says great show as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks from coach Steve You are you are
right technically in in you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need on an uninterrupted darkness
in the vegetative stage But do you like
[SPEAKER_00]: getting woken up when you're sleeping bro
either to the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing there are processes
happening when they're sleeping so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: best not to disrupt them we can But it's
best not to once they've gone asleep for
[SPEAKER_00]: their if it's four to six, maybe eight
hours It's best just to let them rest but
[SPEAKER_00]: it is not nearly as critical if You must
interrupt a light cycle in a grow let it
[SPEAKER_00]: happen during the veg So if you've got a
set up a grow space and you've got like
[SPEAKER_00]: two rooms and you have to walk through one
to get to the other always make the
[SPEAKER_00]: Walkthrough room the veg space because you
can have that one on you can turn it on if
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to get through there the flower
room You cannot interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we discussed in the previous
episode But you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is it mostly Mostly important not to
interrupt that dark period during the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: stage just because things are happening
That's when a lot of processes happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are just chilling They're
doing a lot of processing and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to disrupt that you don't like being
woken up in the middle of the night So
[SPEAKER_00]: just let them process let them do their
things, but it is not critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to cause hermaphrodit ism
They're not gonna freak out on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be hyper critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Let's talk more about the veg food
Phase because I did like that inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as critical to keep them in the
dark phase But the veg phase phase is
[SPEAKER_00]: often overlooked and people weigh heavily
only focus like I did in that episode
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavily heavily they focus too much on the
flower phase So let's talk briefly here
[SPEAKER_00]: about the vegetative stage of growth and
why I feel veg is often overlooked and
[SPEAKER_00]: Super duper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've said super duper since
I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super duper important To have a solid
veg strategy a solid veg space a solid veg
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding regimen a good vegetative goal a
Strategy that all of that is under the
[SPEAKER_00]: word strategy is what I started with veg
is way important and people completely
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about that The vegetative stage is
where we are working on healthy roots
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy roots is where we get healthy
fruits If you don't have healthy plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom, you can't get healthy plants
up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on healthy roots We're
working on general basic plant health so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we start packing on weight These
plants are ready when we start putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them under 1212 and things start going
haywire and their hormonal systems They
[SPEAKER_00]: can transfer nice and smoothly if they are
hit by a pest or something in flower We
[SPEAKER_00]: want them super strong and veg so that
they are ready for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the foundation of everything Do
you want your plants to go to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five and like a hundred and
eighty pounds Or do you want your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: going to flower looking like Brock Lesnar?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like six two and like fucking 280 bro
He could be pick me up snap me in half eat
[SPEAKER_00]: part of me and store rest of me for later
So would you rather have your plants go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking like this or looking like this and
there's still not much there when I do
[SPEAKER_00]: that But you see what I'm trying to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you rather have them looking like
this pin or looking like my wrist which
[SPEAKER_00]: still I know not much difference but that
is up to you and that all happens in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage of your growth Shaping
topping popping twisting bottoming
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipopping These are all things that
should start in the vegetative growth If
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to put your plants in a
trellis and net them out that should
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in the vegetative growth stage
People are forgetting to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things in veg lack of work in veg creates
shit plants in flower shit shaped plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower struggle buds in Flower buds
that are too tall buds that are floppy One
[SPEAKER_00]: bud that's way up here one bud that's way
over here one bud that's way this tall So
[SPEAKER_00]: your lights got to be way up here and you
got these little buds down here that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't getting a lot of light But these
couple of buds are sticking up way close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the light and you're freaking out Veg
is where we can fix and prevent and
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare for all of these problems So shape
them and veg pop them twist them bend them
[SPEAKER_00]: down Get them the structure that you want
the strength and vigor that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare them in the veg Vegetative stage
set yourself up for success before we go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also any mistake you make in the veg phase
Prolongs your flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to correct any problems before I go
to flower I don't like to go into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: with problems because you can't spray you
can't do as many things to the plants once
[SPEAKER_00]: you're into flower So I need my issues of
the room of the grow in my life I need all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the problems resolved before we go into
the flowering phase so if you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with In veg you got to correct that
shit quickly get your plants back on track
[SPEAKER_00]: now Not only are you lacking growth and
performance and vigor from the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Potential that is potential potency
harvest weight of what you're gonna get in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end because you're fucked up in the
veg phase You got to correct that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to recover now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also behind you're probably Minimum
a week to two weeks behind from any
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking problem that happens in your
growth you get spider mites It's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take you a solid two weeks to get rid of
them another week to recover Another week
[SPEAKER_00]: to get back on track now You're fucking
four weeks behind in your grow because you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't taking good enough care of the
vegetative stage That is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative pest management happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all of the shaping and
structuring happens That's where root
[SPEAKER_00]: development happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where all of the planning should
take place Because this is the foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: the structure the infrastructure for the
future plants that we are growing Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to grow struggle buds or do you want
to grow big fat donkey dicks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want one big bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's touching the light with a bunch of
shit at the bottom or do you want a nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Canopy an even row of buds that fills the
entire room with a nice airflow Beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking everything is clean and organized
that's up to you But it starts it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: at day one of the vet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts from the day you cut that clone
It starts when you start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me segue in to that one the room
people don't spend enough money attention
[SPEAKER_00]: time and Details and effort on their
vegetative stage in their vegetative room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry They think they can just hang up
a light and they've got a veg room in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases that will work Do you have a fan in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you controlling the humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you controlling the temperature in
that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something some sort of duct
that pulls old air out and moves it out
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something that brings in fresh
air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need or have a humidifier or
dehumidifier is your veg room setting you
[SPEAKER_00]: up for success you spent all I know you
spent A bunch of money you spent like 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: of your money on the flowering room,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the best lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the best soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the best fucking pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the best timer You got that thing
on the wall that all the lights plug into
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got the best programmable shit on it
You got your PL minder unit or your pulse
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your co2 setup going on You got it
all cranking in the flower room,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you didn't spend shit in the veg room
So by the time you get to that flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room, those plants are wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all fucking unevenly shaped and
fucking look like Charlie Brown's
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree because people don't spend
enough time effort energy money Effort
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the bottom line effort and
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no strategically happening in the
veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You end up with weak light not the
right light lights of the wrong spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: lights that are way too high or way too
low from your plants I see veg rooms that
[SPEAKER_00]: are way too overpacked because they were
poorly planned There's not enough room for
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants for flowering or for
vegetation Plants for clones for shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get way too packed in there They
start getting tall and stretchy starts
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too humid in there start getting
powdery mildew Start getting lazy because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're too packed in start getting spider
mites The plants start going into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and pre flowering because they're too
packed in now Your clones look like shit
[SPEAKER_00]: your next round of veg plants look like
shit It all starts becoming a really quick
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking struggle and it just takes a week
of falling behind for all this shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen So prep your veg room have a really
Nice veg room or I see people with their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants way too far apart a lot of wasted
space in there They're just wasting money
[SPEAKER_00]: because the lights are running if you got
like if you set up your veg room to have
[SPEAKER_00]: two lights For when you have 24 big plants
and right now you got 24 cups Turn off
[SPEAKER_00]: that second light move those fucking
plants under the one light and quit
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting so much space you guys come on
There's so many things you can do to set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success I see plants way
too far apart way too close together
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing that breaks my heart is
filthy filthy Grow rooms sometimes I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: guilty of this Sometimes it takes me a day
or two to get my shit together and get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything caught up and cleaned But it
doesn't stay filthy I see people with just
[SPEAKER_00]: grow rooms that were never even built to
be clean or just never even thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: how Sanitation could affect the quality of
their product I'm not sure why I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: getting spider mites and fungus gnats and
I go to look at your grow and it's like in
[SPEAKER_00]: a shed With a door that doesn't seal and
the fucking bark is peeling off the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: and falling off the tree through the
ceiling into your grow space like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of weird shit that I've seen in
grows you guys clean up just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: take some pride in your grow Take some
pride in your work and those plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: show you they'll be like, oh daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe even mommy Thank you for taking
such good care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna make you so proud You got to
go in there and take care of that veg
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The veg space is just as important if
not more important than your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: space How long are your flowering lights
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours a day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are sleeping for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are your lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: On in veg 16 18 20 hours a day Why
wouldn't you spend enough effort money
[SPEAKER_00]: time energy on making that a super fresh
place for your plants to be also?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need both rooms to be ideal Don't don't
blow the whole budget the whole wad on
[SPEAKER_00]: making a Ferrari of a flowering room if
you're gonna roll around in a pinto of a
[SPEAKER_00]: veg space maybe get to I'm trying to find
cars that are right and they'll get you to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tesla's and now we got a Tesla automated
veg space Tesla automated flowering space
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's gonna send me fucking hate mail
YouTube comments why I chose Tesla.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one I chose I was driving in
Denver and saw a lot of Tesla's recently
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got to say some kind of words,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk for a while and don't get some
criticism you guys.
