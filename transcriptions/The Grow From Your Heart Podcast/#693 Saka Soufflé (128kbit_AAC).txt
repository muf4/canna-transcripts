[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I don't want to ramble too much
here at the beginning of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: May already be too late for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Saka Souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start my strain features by
talking about the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents of Saka Souffle are Biscotti
and Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a female Biscotti plant and an Arise
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode and every episode when I
talk about my Arise male, I will say Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: and King Solomon interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will mean the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon is a specially selected Arise
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just an Arise F1 male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my favorite male in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the best male plants I've ever
used and worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have named him King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read about King Solomon,
you may understand why I chose that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not important but the important
part is knowing that Arise and King
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say male Arise and King Solomon,
same dude, same guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got two names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call him Sully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call him Saul.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's King Solomon or just Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another note, when I list genetics,
I always list ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hear me say Biscotti to Arise or
whatever to whatever, Girl Scout Cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: to Grateful Dog or Banana Kush to Cherry
Widow, I'm always listing ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I say second is the pollen
donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying pollen donor at this time
because sometimes that is a reversed cross
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a female that gave us pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't truly a male but it was the
pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say that it always is the
pollen receiver to the pollen donor first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the easy way to remember that is
ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm talking about crosses,
when I say right now Biscotti to Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do mean that Biscotti was the lady in
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to try to not ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already too late for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cross is Biscotti to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my research, there were
differing results on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a couple of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my research, what made the
most sense to me from the research online,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavors, aromas, growth experience
with this plant, I'm going to agree that I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it is Gelato, Girl Scout Cookies,
and South Florida OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any varying information or
better or different information and you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to have a friendly conversation
about it, if you come at me like a dick,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to delete your email to be
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're cool and calm and collected and
friendly and want to have a conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: my email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you believe the cross is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm open to those friendly conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy and appreciate that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Biscotti came from a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew it from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled so good and the flowers,
when I smoked the flowers, it made me
[SPEAKER_00]: super mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me that, we can't say Girl Scout
Cookies anymore, but from here out,
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout Cookies means, or GSC means
Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me that GSC buzz, but it grew so
much better than the GSC and it gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: more of an open buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: GSC or the Cookies I'll call it,
kind of put me in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to shut me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put me in my own zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not very social.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to grab a guitar, grab a drum,
write something, be creative, search the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, scroll my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what GSC or Cookies kind of did to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Biscotti had that punch to the face
from the Cookies, but also kind of made me
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be more social.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me want to talk and didn't put me
in my own silent bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better for being social,
better for being outdoors and active and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the public, which I often have to be
over here on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine just being in your bubble here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoyed the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't shut me down as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to grow better than the
original Cookies that seems to be crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, but it had a lot of Cookies
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like just turbo Cookies,
better Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoy that because I really liked
the Cookies back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Gelato Girl Scout Cookies,
South Florida OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smelled good, really dense flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of made me mellow, but not too
mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to Cookies, better grower,
but a more outgoing social buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before that when I talk about King
Solomon and Arise, it is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an F1 Arise that was specially
selected and he is named King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Golden Goat female pollinated by
a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Golden Goat's got that tropical sweet
kind of flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows with kind of an indica structure,
but sativa traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a very sativa dominant head
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gets to your brain and makes
your head spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that Golden Goat mixes in with
everything that I cross from the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really adds to the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Golden Goat doing the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side of that cross,
we've got the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got Chem and Kush flavors and
aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant had big, wide, fat leaves that
you could camp under.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could live under those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had that funky, earthy, cushy,
gassy, chemical sort of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bred the Golden Goat, that sweet
tropical to that gassy, cushy thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that gave us Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those plants grow with what I call
hypervigor and great potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you cross the Arise to anything,
that hypervigor and potency comes along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I breed almost everything to
King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see everything crossed to Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cross a lot of stuff to eject the Ripper
male, and I do a lot of reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Solomon is my most used male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I've selected Solomon for
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he was bred to the Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about how these
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original plants, the parent plants
that will lead us into a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: how the offspring are expected to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Biscotti grows fairly quickly,
and it got fairly tall in the garden quite
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to pop it, twist it,
bend it over, manipulate it some way
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a good thing because I like
those vigorous, fast-growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes would make long
branches, and it would always make
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every branch, every top on the plant of
the Biscotti was just dense, rock-hard
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets with beautiful colorings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make pinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go from light greens to pinks,
and then it would fade into like
[SPEAKER_00]: burgundies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the top cola would always just be a
big, it would look like a baseball bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how big the plant was,
we're just kicking out baseball bats out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I now?
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden, the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before, the Arise,
it grows with hyper vigorous, super quick
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super resistant to mold,
super resistant to bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passes on that super potency trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Arise and the Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds from the Biscotti were great,
and the buzz was super nice, but I say
[SPEAKER_00]: that Arise fixes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really nothing wrong with the
Biscotti, but if you could have your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite thing and make it better,
just make it turbo-charge everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want everything stronger, faster,
louder right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could do that if we pollinated it
with the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Arise is the champ,
so I hit it with my King Solomon pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon pollen could be a tongue
twister if you try to say it too many
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I crossed those, and it made a strain
that I call sacca souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this gets us to something that a lot
of people have been asking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people also understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell does sacca souffle mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you come up with this name?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me at all, if you've been
following me on social media for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've been watching the podcast,
if you know me personally, you know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: am a huge fan of comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love stand-up comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that life kind of beats us down
all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a life bar like in a video
game, when the boss yells at you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a couple of damage points.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the cops get behind you and make you
nervous, your damage bar starts flashing
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting all weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that comedy and music,
a lot of it is comedy, a lot of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: music in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those refill your damage bar, your energy
bar, your life bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes life better again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like kissing the boo-boos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get told some good jokes and you just
feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like soup on a sick day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling about comedy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan of stand-up comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode I put out was about The
Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, of course, was named after Burt
Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Saka Soufflé was named kind of
after a combination of another one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite comedians, Tom Segura,
also Larry King.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell the story of how this name
came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Segura, one of my favorite comedians,
was on Larry King Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Larry King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, rest in peace, Larry King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry King asked Tom Segura, one of his
guilty pleasures, and Tom Segura
[SPEAKER_00]: innocently answered, Chocolate Soufflé.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Larry King at the time was about 132
years old, and he squinted and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: confused and said, Saka Soufflé.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where Saka Soufflé came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of took that sound by it and made
it a strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became very popular on Your Mom's House
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the name of the show, Your Mom's
House Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where Tom Segura and Christina
Paszynski do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: High and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, jeans?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're into weird, if you're broken
like me, you would enjoy that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird, great humor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is where Saka Soufflé came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clip became real popular on their
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched that show a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friends and I would just say Saka Soufflé
when somebody was just doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: outlandish, or if there wasn't the right
thing to say at the right time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just go Saka Soufflé.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just fills gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Saka Soufflé became a strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I wasn't going to ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Tom Segura also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about growing some Saka
Soufflé.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes of Saka Soufflé are going
to take between 60 and 70 days to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker black leaf phenotype finishes
in 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a phenotype that pops up
that is kind of short and kind of squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes dark, dark leaves very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably aren't messing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like you're having a problem,
like you're struggling in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from the, we're not allowed to
say Girl Scout cookies anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have to say cookies or GSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Girl Scout cookies got mad that
somebody made a strain called Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to say GSC cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say random things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Culturally it's cookies, GSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say those when I'm talking about Girl
Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Girl Scout cookies would turn
black back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a hashtag on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I said the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a hashtag on social media that
said hashtag black leaf society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was because a lot of the Girl
Scout cookies, the cookies, the cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses plants, we're changing black leaf
colors in mid to late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a phenotype where the petioles
are turning really dark purple really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and the leaves fade to black,
you're probably not messing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just what these plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that black leaf phenotype does finish
at 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighter colored plants do take
approximately 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of seems like the darker,
the shorter finishing and the lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are the longer finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lighter color, it could be a
nutrient thing also, but if you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: them right and feeding them properly,
the lighter colored plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a little bit longer with this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really enjoy the funky gross
aromas and flavors that come from the sac
[SPEAKER_00]: à souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off with that peppery cookie
dough thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds weird, but imagine
if you took one of those store-bought logs
[SPEAKER_00]: of cookie dough and just sprinkled just a
hint of black pepper in it and it warmed
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a warm cookie dough with pepper
sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, really do enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got pastries, sugary pastries,
maybe some sort of scones or maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: bakery aisle at the store, maybe just a
bakery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that sort of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are some phenotypes that
present a cough syrup sort of a smell and
[SPEAKER_00]: also a bubblegum sort of a candy flavored
sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's one that mixes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when you were little,
sometimes they gave us a pink cough syrup
[SPEAKER_00]: that was almost good, almost gross at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes reminded me of that
good gross pink cough syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of pastry, peppery candy
flavored, then there's a bubblegum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's a cough syrup funky
flavor that does appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great aromas and flavors,
but those are what the flavors I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: can expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more, but I'm going to stop
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can confuse you and give you too many
descriptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad habit of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect cookie dough, pastries,
cough syrup, and some bubblegum
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that the lighter colors are
more prone, have more potential for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dark colored plants aren't going to
have the bubblegum in most cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
growth, shape, and structure of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are, they make really tight
buds and most of the phenotypes make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: baseball bat type center bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how you train it, trim it,
top it, that middle bud with the center
[SPEAKER_00]: stock, that thing likes to grow a big fat
chunky bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost always expect impressive
top colas from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes only grow a top
cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a screen or a sea of green type
grower, the kind of grower that just puts
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of plants like small plants in one
table or one tray, packs them in real
[SPEAKER_00]: tight, just wants one tall branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phenotype in this line that does
do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for that one cola,
I call it the spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes one big rock all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one that is more kind of
bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows kind of even and it doesn't get
that super top cola and it grows real even
[SPEAKER_00]: without topping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of bushy, makes that menorah
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another one that does
the, it gets kind of bushy, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't, it gets real tall and the
branches get real long, but it doesn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: out real wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays real and real skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got one that kind of branches out,
gets bushy, doesn't make a top,
[SPEAKER_00]: one that is just tops and then one that is
a top with branches trying to keep up
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three dominant phenotypes
that I, phenotypical categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say categories because you're
going to see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an F1 cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see variation,
but that one big spear is a common
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That menorah type branchy one is a very
common phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one that just gets tall and lanky
with a bunch of chasers, that is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: common phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one that gets tall and has all the
chasers, every bud along the side and
[SPEAKER_00]: along the bottom will rock up and be
silver and shiny and covered and
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the bottoms on these plants are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one that's just a tall spear all the
way down, usable harvestable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one that's bushy and spreads out,
that's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like a classic plant
that'll grow very well and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you're expecting and looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one may change colors on you a little
more quickly and it'll get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: woody as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got that more branchy spread out
phenotype, that's you're going to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, possibly some woodier type
responses from the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about some specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are kind of slow growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my plants are known for
hypervigour and they grow very quickly in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that these don't grow as
quickly in veg, but the minute you put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in flower, they make up for all of
the lost time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go shebang, kapow, they take
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have the potential and
opportunity to triple in size from when
[SPEAKER_00]: you put them in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're one foot tall when you put
the plant in flower, expect it to get up
[SPEAKER_00]: to three feet tall by the time it is
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow proper light space, allow proper
ceiling space.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have the potential to triple
in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that again, triple three
times the size from when you flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can get out of control for some
growers, so be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a scrog net,
if you're bending, popping, twisting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that tall, stretchy pheno
that makes the stretchy branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: that bad bitch is going to triple in size
before it is done, so be ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have to mention?
[SPEAKER_00]: The straight spear, that one big cola,
the bush, the rocks, oh, the black leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are getting black leaves,
I probably said this already, that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably just the phenotype from
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That even bushier phenotype is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing will put out great product that
smells great, looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The node spacing is super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of not the super easiest plant
to grow, but the smoke from that one is my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bushier phenotype is my favorite to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now I'm going to talk about the
buzz that I experience when I smoke sacca
[SPEAKER_00]: souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I got from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like sacca souffle is the kind of
herb that you could roll up a big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: joint and smoke it on the way to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get to work, you clock in,
and by the time you clock out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just had a long, hard day at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like just get shit done weed,
but you don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're so in this tunnel vision
thing, but you're still like uppity and
[SPEAKER_00]: pepity, so you could deal with customers
if you got a social job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be great work weed if you
had to go deal with people, deal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into the public,
it would be good herb if you like to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go out in public and go do your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be great for that because it
gives you that, it just gives you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a pep, but it also gives you that
like super high kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you get too high,
you get too much into your bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one doesn't put you into that little
private bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give you the blinders that they
put on the horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the herb I breed will give you the
blinders and give you a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one doesn't give you too much of
that, but it does put you in the bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I did notice was every time I
smoked it, it kind of got me like above
[SPEAKER_00]: and behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like my hat was too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost felt like I was wearing a
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a strain called headband,
but it did feel like I had like my
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones were too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept like feeling like pressure or
something around my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed it and I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets me in the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts me in that bubble, but I'm also
still functional, which is a good thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for me because people like to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: People expect me to be functional and
doing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't be too roasted all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that those, the phenotypes,
they get the purple pedials, the long
[SPEAKER_00]: purple leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to give you more of that,
that tunnel vision sort of a, sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work into that part of the paper
where I always write tips and tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already mentioned that this plant is
a slow grower, but it does explode in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote again, triple in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes of these plants
will triple in size, be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been forewarned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fat, dense nugs, even the lowers get dense
and frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have your environment dialed
in, you may want to pop and twist and bend
[SPEAKER_00]: and top these plants and create a bunch of
smaller bud sites instead of just one big
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic bud site.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lay it on its side, those smaller
buds will grow up and you don't get one
[SPEAKER_00]: big giant dense bat, you get a row of
smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tip that big branch on its side,
it may help you out with mold issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to get big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your environment dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants, some of the phenotypes I
mentioned, I may have mentioned that the
[SPEAKER_00]: bushier phenotypes will get a little bit
woody later in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop and twist them early because you don't
want them to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the woody phenotypes will get a
little bit crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need some sort of
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even those single bud phenotypes,
they may enjoy some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just put down a screen and put one
bud per screen or just put one stick per
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, that would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tall stretchy one is definitely going
to need some sort of supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light green phenotypes are more bendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easier to work into a trellis,
into a canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more pliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they start getting a little bit
purple, they do get kind of woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do kind of snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll break off leaves and branches much
more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with those purple
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a nutrient deficiency that's
not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just something in the genetics
that does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop and twist those gently because you
don't want those to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them branch out to prevent that giant
cola at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple stems and purple and dark colors is
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that, but that is in my
notes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fades hard in late bloom and looks sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a phosphorus or a potassium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that purple stalk finishes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a nutrient issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wrote down was sometimes the plant
itself looks like it's done before the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let the plant keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes will ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if those leaves are black and turning
gold and yellow, let it keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some very beautiful photo
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is entering what is called
senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, dude, I've done my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only supposed to live a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only supposed to flower for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its whole goal was to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of its organs to receive pollen have
now receded and dried up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's waiting for its time to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just waiting for you to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until you do, those trichomes will
keep ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let it keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut it down too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That trait again does come from the GSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what trait in the GSC,
what line from that came from what parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is a trait from the GSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who grew the cookies back in the
day, we saw it turn different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it black.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental factors and pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients would change these plants so
many different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually just realized that when you
dial it in, it will change a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not anything we're doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to overfeed it to correct a
nutrient issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it'll stack up and make a good
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overfeed it, it'll do what I call
the spiral staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the main stock and then right up
that stem, you get a bud here and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: bud here and a bud here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't fill in like it's supposed
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed it properly, that'll all fill
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be one giant cola that fills up that
whole Maristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be one chunky baseball bat worth of
nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else do I have to go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants handle spider mites very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one tester get hit with regular
spider mites and these plants didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had another tester get hit with the
worst of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the russets and he said these
plants fared the best in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to call anybody out for
their russets, but good work for
[SPEAKER_00]: recovering from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finished the harvest of this plant
with russets.
[SPEAKER_00]: and made it to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, my final notes on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to expect big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have airflow and VPD dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly water less to reduce humidity and
to prevent issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watering less, you're going to
have less water in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will reduce transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants don't make a lot of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull off a lot of those big leaves with
the long purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make less air in the room,
less transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have as much water in the room
just because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants don't really like cold at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get purple and they stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some plants on a cold floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had another person report their room
got cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them, excuse me, don't get them
extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic diurnal temperature swings will be
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your five, seven, maybe 10 degree swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them cold at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds just turned into these black
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They freeze up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not like being overwatered and
they especially don't like cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No plants really do enjoy the cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slightly challenging to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is they're supposed to change
colors and do weird shit and new growers
[SPEAKER_00]: see those colors and see the differences
that these plants do and they panic and
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out and try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it just like any other plant and it
will work just like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't fuck it up and freak it out,
it won't fuck up and freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to change colors and do
weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find my pages in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is they like low pH and
medium nutrients in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much nitrogen will make it do the bud
spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that spiral staircase a
moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much nitrogen will definitely
attribute to the spiral staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did say low pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time I recommend about six,
two to six, four, stick around that six,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, six, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen these plants grow very well in
low, low pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them go five, eight,
and thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make the dark plants really dark,
really purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low pH and lots of kelp I think will bring
out a lot of stank that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: stank, not just stink, it's stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another, I've got one last page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure that I'm going to edit
that out because I'm on such a good flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best grows were in soil or soilless
mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant didn't seem to like hydro as
much as the soilless mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the hydro guys did kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soilless and organic guys were
crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were going to grow sacca souffle,
I would probably grow it four,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon pots under a thousand watt
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would veg it until it reached the scrog
net and then I would put it into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the first two weeks work it into
that scrog net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll take off and keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may put up another net to support those
big buds, but that's probably how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I would find that phenotype that shoots
one main cola and I would do in a five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five, I'd probably do depending on
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had unlimited numbers, probably go
with 16 of those in a five by five,
[SPEAKER_00]: veg them till they're about a foot and a
half tall, then flip them and they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would probably do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there's a lot of space when
they grow because they get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy, but they will fill in if you
don't overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veggies like cookies is what I wrote down,
but it takes off in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, do the sea of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a good phenotype that makes the big
cola and just cram a bunch of them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the hydro guy that grows on
cubes, do the four by four table with like
[SPEAKER_00]: 64 cubes and veg for like a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant would kill it with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I would recommend sacca
souffle outdoors for a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you've got a good environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it makes giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those giant buds do put you at risk for
problems outdoors late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we saw a lot of people with bud
rot, with powdery mildew, with extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: damage in the middle of their buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fear that this may make such big buds,
you would experience those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you can control that,
I don't know that I would recommend this
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants do make a very great calyx to
leaf ratio, so they are easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hate trimming and you like big fat
harvest, these may be the plants for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very nice bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds have a silvery purple color that
comes from the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them get very dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others are very bright, bright green,
so you're going to get very good bag
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rosin, we made, I can't say we,
I watched, I supervised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my hands on my hips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smelling a lot going smells like
you're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friends of mine made rosin and the rosin
that came out of the press looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had, it was silver and glittery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a silver sheen with
speckles in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like they were mixing metallic
paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really beautiful concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dab tasted like eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that camera just fucking died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to finish it on this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to finish up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasted like eating a buttery pastry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I got to go quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want this to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smelled like buttery armpits, bad armpits,
or a hippie girl who works as a pastry
[SPEAKER_00]: chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up because that
camera died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out my website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I have here at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, Rosin Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I got all this on recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
