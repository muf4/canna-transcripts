All
[SPEAKER_01]: right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 828 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
on in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to let you know that there
will be a Valentine's Day sale at
[SPEAKER_00]: irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: irydirect.com will get a fresh restock,
a fresh drop of new products and prices
[SPEAKER_00]: will be reduced for Valentine's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out irydirect.com for
the Valentine's Day sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I don't want to waste too much
time here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into most people's
favorite portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the grow help portion of today's
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of today's questions are going to be
focused on breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the questions also came from the
grow help tab on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you go to irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a row of tabs on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them says questions or grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a few preliminary questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will ask what type of question do you
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a garden question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a general question?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a grow question, we will then ask
about the temperature, the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic questions to give me an idea of how
to help this grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then most importantly, we give you a space
to ask your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me those grow questions by using that
grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the show,
you will win a free coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds at irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question on today's breeding
podcast came from our friend who wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: be called Brian J.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Brian J.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the good breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, bro, for the love and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, That is a huge compliment to my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You admitted that you made a few mistakes
and they were still some of the best that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job for having a great successful
grow and also good job for admitting that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've made some mistakes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard part for a lot of people to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great job admitting it and also good
job on that great crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am currently in week six with
the machine and the plants are exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what I am looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the machine is hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it works out beautifully for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of it, but let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know there's a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am planning on making my first
batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always a fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am going to use your Jack the
Ripper F2 number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be an awesome project as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, You and Subcool have taught me so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no better seeds to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, that is a huge honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing my best to pass the torch that
Subcool passed to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was about a generation ahead of me
in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I often say that Subcool taught
me a lot of what to do and a lot of what
[SPEAKER_00]: not to do in the cannabis world,
in the cannabis industry, in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out, big rest in peace to my
buddy Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is an honor to think that Subcool
and myself are the two guys teaching you
[SPEAKER_00]: and inspiring you to breed and that you
want to use my Jack the Ripper F2s,
[SPEAKER_00]: which maybe some people don't know that
Jack the Ripper was originally made by
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given honor and blessing by his
former partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the word there?
[SPEAKER_00]: His ex-wife, Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given the blessing to use that Jack
the Ripper in a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made F2s of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also made a lot of out-crosses with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our friend Brian J.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: here has chosen the Jack the Ripper F2
number five phenotype to make his very
[SPEAKER_00]: first breeding project with because he
learned a lot of what he knows from
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge honor to Sub and myself,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my goal is to grow plants with
the strongest smell and taste possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to critique you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your very first breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for the strongest smell,
which of course is what everybody wants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that smell and taste,
but what about things like potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about plant vigor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about resistance to problems like
pathogens and maybe bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about resistance to drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the ability to tolerate light
stress or cold stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just other things I would
recommend you also add to the requirement
[SPEAKER_00]: list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know about all the positive
traits that you should be looking for in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you might not look for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to remind you that it is
awesome to breed for that aroma and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about vigor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about plant structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are also things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to throw some ideas at you
because you're new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not discouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on that smell and taste if that's
what you'd like to do, but also keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind those other things I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure, growth, flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if these plants take 140 days to
flower, but they taste exactly how you
[SPEAKER_00]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that tolerable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people wouldn't accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just things to think about there,
other than just taste and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, knowing that, is there a male
I should look for that will fit these
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that you can talk about in
the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, the hard part about
seeking a male is that the only way to
[SPEAKER_00]: truly tell what flavor and aroma that male
plant is going to pass to the progeny is
[SPEAKER_00]: by breeding with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to find a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that a little bit more in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some criteria for helping you
find a male, but you've got to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what you've also got to do is you've
got to find the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a female plant that tastes very
close or exactly like what you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that female plant available?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part of this is to find that
girl that tastes very much like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor that you're seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find that female plant, then find a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a moment ago, I talked about
structure and vigor and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me refer to my notes here because I
did make a couple of notes that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in my experience,
in my reading, from what I understand to
[SPEAKER_00]: the best of my knowledge, but I am not an
expert, generally, in most instances,
[SPEAKER_00]: that male plant, the male part of the
program here, the male plant of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation is the word I'm looking for,
contributes to the structure, the vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the flowering time heavily,
and the pest and pathogen resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff comes from the male
side of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So select a male, and what I would
recommend is find a female that's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just breeding for flavor,
find a female plant with the exact flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then find a male from the Jack the Ripper
line that has structure, that has vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's got all of the physical or all of
the visual things that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that from the male plant because what
I think, what I believe, is the male
[SPEAKER_00]: contributes heavily, heavily, heavily to
the structure, the vigor, the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and the pest and pathogen and stress
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that will come from the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you insist on going mostly for
flavor, find a girl that tastes real good
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can already verify that she's
got that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look for that male that has the
structure you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, like I keep saying, also look for
that female with the flavor and aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: then breed them together, and then you're
going to find a phenotype out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: that will carry that structure,
that vigor, that plant growth traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for, and it will also have
that flavor and aroma because it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've mixed that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've stirred it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes that come from this
will have that flavor guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you really want to lock that in,
if you want to do this, you said knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you asked about a male, I'm going to
totally throw you off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a girl, a female plant that's
got the traits that you're in love with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could easily reverse that plant,
take two clones of it, reverse one,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that pollen on the other, and make
feminized seeds of that plant if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: what you wanted to do, if you're going
strictly for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like your idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to... it sounds like you plan
to start with a male and a female,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I've said multiple times now,
find the female that tastes just like what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the male with the structure,
the vigor, a good growing male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know it when you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool taught me this, and I'm going to
pass this knowledge on to you at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the delicious hypothetically say
you've got a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually there's 10 seeds, and my 10 packs
is usually 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got probably 10 of them worked for
you just because you might be a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making assumptions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just doing math out of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time five of them will be
female, five will be male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females are easy to select from
because we can... we get to experience
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to grow them, smell them,
touch them, smoke them, consume them,
[SPEAKER_00]: get high from them, and enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females will be obvious which one you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males we don't necessarily get to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get to consume, but the females
are easier to phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how I kind of do the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got five boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally there will be one or two that
take off flowering very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, hey, look at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get ahead of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start making pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two boys in that pack usually do not
get to be my breeding candidates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what Subcool taught me, and from what
I understand from my own experience from
[SPEAKER_00]: using Sub's guidance, I have learned an
experience that those males that flower
[SPEAKER_00]: too quickly, that are too eager to flower,
they pass too much of themselves to my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I mean by that is if I take a
male, I'm just going to pick something
[SPEAKER_00]: random here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took a male that is chocolate,
and I pollinated strawberry, banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: lemons, and gas, I want chocolate
strawberry, chocolate lemons, chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: banana, and chocolate gas is what I hope
to get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use that first dude, he will make
everything taste like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remake this dude all over again
because his genetics are so dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: are so strong in this mix, that all of his
kids look just like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mommy has no chance of getting a daughter
that looks just like her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to be a bunch of fucking
beefcake-looking dudes look just like this
[SPEAKER_00]: over-testosterone male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that I can explain it to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those first two are usually not the
candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth one, he's taken too long to
flower, usually not the candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's usually the third and fourth male
in the mix to show me that they're male,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually one of them is a little taller,
one of them is a little different shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that's what I choose from is males
number three and four out of those five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first two that take off,
I don't like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one to take off, he's usually too
slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually number three or number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that tall lanky one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the short squatty one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one with the big wide
leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend though is flower
all five of them out as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can take them to like week six,
week seven, week eight, you'll get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of flower structure they
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get to see that big old flower
cluster on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really fun and interesting watching
flowers on male plants develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to make a shit ton of
pollen, so be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got other rooms in flower,
try not to contaminate those rooms with
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, but doing a male phenol hunt is
very fun and very rewarding if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flower out those boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for, like I said, remove one and two,
you'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go into flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's gonna get way tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cull those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, four, and five, keep an eye on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers three and four, those are gonna be
your candidates out of a 10-pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been rambling for a couple of
minutes about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that good male that provides that
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got to pollinate with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, my goal in
selecting a male is to find a male that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put chocolate or whatever
selected flavor into the mix so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: make chocolate strawberry, chocolate
banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that dude that's just gonna
dominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those later flowering guys,
they're not so dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're genetics that when you breed
to them, they're going to allow their
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities, their traits to pass into the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also mommy gets a chance to show her
beauty and her expression in the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back to my notes because I've
gotten way off track, although I'm right
[SPEAKER_00]: where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate your favorite female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put in parentheses females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I like to do, I keep saying
this, when I'm breeding with the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, I just say to take that chocolate
and put it to strawberry, bananas,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking pineapples, watermelons,
breed it to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I want to do that, the reason I
recommended breeding your male plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple female plants, different females
if you can, is because here's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what he presents and
delivers and across multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I breed chocolate to bananas and it
comes out chocolate bananas, I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: these two plants make chocolate bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give me any evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives me what these two plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I breed that to strawberry and lemon
and one comes out chocolate strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: now I know that it delivers that chocolate
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the chocolate and the banana plant,
both are the strawberry and banana plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that I bred it to make progeny that are
both really, really tall, then I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: that trait came from the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the progeny come out with like a really
weird color across three different
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny, then I know that the male is
delivering that because that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: commonality in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I like to breed to multiple
different females from one male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another option, and I'm going
to fuck with your head here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you've got a 10 pack of the
Jack the Ripper number five plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you could do, which would be a
lot of fun, and you will find the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that's got the flavor that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put all 10 of those plants in a
room, all five boys, all five girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could just let a wild,
crazy plant orgy happen in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is called is an open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were going to list that on paper to
describe it, you would just say five Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper females crossed to five Jack
the Ripper males and an open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several good reasons to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes a lot more seeds if you want
to preserve this line and make a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will show you so many of the genetic
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will show the genetic potential in so
many different ways, because you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: every male and every female phenotype
available for the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to pollinate each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the mathematical equation,
but it's five million something or 250
[SPEAKER_00]: million something, is the way that I think
it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took plant number one and
pollinated all five of these, that's five
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then plant number two and pollinated
all five of these, and you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All five plants will pollinate all five
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have lines going to be string
theory, all crazy going from one plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a possibility, that open
pollination, or you can remove anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't like and still perform the open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you different ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do is find the
female that tastes like what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male with the structure,
the vigor, the leaf shape, the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time that you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would grow out those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would try to find the phenotype
that tastes just like you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're satisfied with that,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ta-da!
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your first breeding project,
and it is successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find the phenotype, your goal is to
find the phenyl with your flavor desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find that, you have hit your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to go for further generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really fun idea, but if you are
breeding strictly for flavor, that's fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what about potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you want to get really, really high
from it also?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is, it's going to get
you really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're breeding strictly for
flavor, think about it like when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: building characters on a video game.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave you a hundred points to build
your character.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say it was a
basketball video game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some speed was one of the
attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got shooting accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got stamina, and then there's probably
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what it is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ability to sell sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got all five of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to fill them up with as much as
you want, but you've only got a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: points to put into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing happens when we are
breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a hundred points worth of
attributes to assign.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you focus 90% of that on flavor,
the potency, the vigor, all that other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is going to fall to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep flavor and aroma up there real
high as you your importance, but also keep
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind that we need some potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do insist on breeding one plant
strictly for flavor, what I would also do
[SPEAKER_00]: now, this is where it's going to get
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to talk about line
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck is line breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your, we're going to breed two
different lines of the same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to breed a Jack the Ripper F2
from you've got F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to breed F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make the Jack the Ripper
F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to select for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only just select for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from those F3s, we're going to find
those seeds and select for flavor and make
[SPEAKER_00]: F4 from that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're then going to make F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now by this time, every time we grow these
seeds, we should find that exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor every time, almost every plant 89,
95% of these plants should taste exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we talked about, just like
you're searching for, because this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: fifth generation that we have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got them at F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the third or fourth generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've bred specifically for that one
specific flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't have that aroma and flavor,
you did not breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got pushed away out of the breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone five generations locking down
this flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I would also do at the same exact
time, I would run a parallel breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project of Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with the same exact seeds,
but on this side I would breed for potency
[SPEAKER_00]: and vigor because I want a vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a potent plant and a plant that
tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus line one is Jack
the Ripper flavor town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on this other side, in this other
breeding room, I'm going to breed a Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper that is nothing but potency and
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could taste like cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could taste like dog puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it is the most potent plant in
the room and it is vigorous when it grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what I'm breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: F3, F4, F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go to F6 on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of depends on what the
phenotypes are showing me at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on both sides, when I germinate these
seeds, I'm getting 89 to 95 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous plants, which means they all
look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this side, they're all going to smell
exactly like that one aroma that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Jack the Ripper lime turp that I
found that I'm in love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every phenotype makes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this other side, every phenotype is
ridiculously potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got an amazing structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now guess what we're going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to breed those two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be our true F1
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could take you 15 years to accomplish
that, to be realistic with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rush that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be in a hurry to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get to F5, F6, that's five or six
years worth of work right there if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to do it on two different
sides on two different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to carefully select.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in that breeding project,
there will be a misstep and you will have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go backwards one generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens when you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think this is the male I need to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it and you grow them out and you
go, well, fuck, I didn't find what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just chose the wrong male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just time, space, money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still get to smoke all the weed and
have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the breeding didn't make any forward
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to go back and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm talking about here is line
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first idea is to create a strain that
is completely flavor town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want vigor and potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use the same genetics and
just keep going in filial generations and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding again a different project,
either line A or line B, line one,
[SPEAKER_00]: line two, flavor town and fucking trichome
town, whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep breeding and then make this one
only focused on potency and structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this other one is just focused on
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I get to the F5 or F6,
I'll get the female that has the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find a male phenotype from that
population of seeds that looks just like
[SPEAKER_00]: what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That structure, I'm sure it's going to
pass on that potency, pollinate that
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor town female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the offspring from that will be the
super vigorous, the super flavorful and
[SPEAKER_00]: the super potent brand new F1 version of
your line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what also comes with that brand
new hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that you could
definitely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have taken this simple answer way
too far, but this was a really fun ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easy way to do it is to find that male
that fits an easy criteria, find a female
[SPEAKER_00]: that tastes good, let them fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go further, I definitely
give you a lot of different avenues to
[SPEAKER_00]: have fun with that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Brian, I hope I thoroughly
answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a fun breeding question for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to talk about a lot of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to pay tribute to our buddy
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out and rest in peace to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also my friend, the best part maybe,
you win a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
you will have a coupon code in your email
[SPEAKER_00]: for free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your email right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check the spam if you don't
find it, because sometimes they think the
[SPEAKER_00]: codes are spammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this party going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came also from the Grow Help tab
at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question, you do win a free
pack of iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Pegasus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Pegasus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Pegasus, check your email,
check your spam folder because you,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend, have a coupon code for a free
pack of iReGenetics premium seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pegasus's question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's up, Pegasus?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a question about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the breeding episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, let's just say if I were to breed
a male Arise plant with a female
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterglow, would the offspring be any
different if I had used the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the female Arise and the male
Afterglow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Much thanks and keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ironically, I made Afterglow,
which is clementine to Arise, which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kills it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also I put that Afterglow plant
in a greenhouse and pollinated that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Arise again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first half of this has happened,
which is really weird that you brought
[SPEAKER_00]: that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My idea there was to put a little more
power into the Afterglow, just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more turbocharged but also try to keep
that orange turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's answer the question at hand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about just a moment ago,
it is my belief, my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: my theory that much of that flavor and
aroma is coming from the female side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the other traits do come from the
female side, but what is really noticeable
[SPEAKER_00]: is the flavor and the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what I think happens from the male
side, like I said, is that vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the structure, the plant, the flowering
time is heavily contributed by the male,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resistance to problems comes from the
male side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, if you did switch them,
you're just automatically going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing that came to my mind is
knowing about breeding, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the male version of Arise and the
female version of Arise, you may select
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have different traits
within themselves, so that already starts
[SPEAKER_00]: us doing different opportunities in the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I do believe if you reverse them,
you're going to change something,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I believe kind of when you're
breeding, you're taking traits from the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes, the traits from mom,
traits, chromosomes from dad, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them into a, whatever,
a primordial blender and you shake it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however those chromosomes and traits
all land, that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's going to land
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more predisposition to get certain
outcomes if the male and female are
[SPEAKER_00]: certain variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no scientific evidence to back that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just it's got to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it would not be science when science
and nature together would not make that
[SPEAKER_00]: come out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that without any real,
I don't have any science to back up that
[SPEAKER_00]: claim, but that just makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've got different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took the afterglow female and Arise
male, and then you did that work,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you tried to switch that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to find phenotypes that
looked just like the opposites,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the male that looks just like the,
I think you understand what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the challenge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that phenotypical variation is going
to be enough to cause variation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: different breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you're just reshuffling the
deck and just putting all the black cards
[SPEAKER_00]: in one spot and all the red cards in
another spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just reshuffling and we're going
to get different outcomes in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered that question quite
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to branch off of the last question
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pegasus, thank you for the great
