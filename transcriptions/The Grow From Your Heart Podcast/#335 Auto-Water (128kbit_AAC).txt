[SPEAKER_00]: Yo what's up podcast world it's Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get the show started let me make
a quick disclaimer and sort of an apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I recorded a solid podcast
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my heart and soul into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a lot of time recording this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was listening back to edit parts of
the audio files started disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what was happening to my
computer or my software but the words I
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying were disappearing from the
fucking screen as time went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I tried to play with the computer
and edit and figure out what happened the
[SPEAKER_00]: more shit was disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was making my podcast vanish one
paragraph at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys the podcast you're gonna get has
some missing chunks and I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nearly 1 30 and I owe you a Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put this out so that you know I
at least tried and I didn't let you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to know what I said in
those parts that are missing I'll do my
[SPEAKER_00]: best to go back and kind of piece it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly it's driving me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I've got to offer you and
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the half ass podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be times when the audio drops
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't miss too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is all about building a drip
system or an automated water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not into that you're not
going to miss a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really into building an auto
water system and you miss stuff in here
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know and we'll try to get it
together for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys my throat's burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take some dabs and get some
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the grow
from your heart podcast your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower if you're a
professional grower if you're a new smoker
[SPEAKER_00]: or a dedicated dabber if you're a cannabis
activist or even someone who is just
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about the current state of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This my friends is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.

[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo what's up weed world it's time for
episode 335 of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot to talk about in this
episode so I'm going to try and make this
[SPEAKER_00]: intro quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show off by letting
you know what I'm perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at green
dot labs for the chem brulee full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right you guys we've got a lot of
stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to run you guys through
building a drip system or an automated or
[SPEAKER_00]: assisted watering system for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do two different versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a setup using kind of like
a water wand to set up to where you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: wand and you water each plant with this
wand but it will be set up to a reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're being fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're also going to run through a
setup using emitters or sprinklers in each
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these setups could be useful to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you to decide which setup you
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In veg I usually use the water wand in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I switch to the auto or
assisted watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what I'm saying will need to be
customized for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will need to be custom tailored for
your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will need to be custom measured
for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very good guideline
on how to get you started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a drip system all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be useful for any size grow
anywhere from one light to 500 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ideas will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just may need to be modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I'm going to talk about two
different setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about a drip system with
emitters for each plant and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about a water wand and a reservoir in
a pump style setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get into it it will be more clear
which setup is best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've both got their benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've both got their downfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about benefits of using a drip
watering or assisted watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first obvious advantages or
benefits to using a drip or auto watering
[SPEAKER_00]: or assisted watering system is that it
simply makes watering more efficient and
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes less time which will free up a
grower to do things like work the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: or defoliate or scout for bugs or simply
clean up things that have been getting
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building an auto watering system will
free up time no matter how big your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should save you some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the first benefit in a large
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will free you up a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a thousand plants you'll go
from spending all day watering plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: just a couple of hours watering every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to mix up solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably 250 to maybe a thousand
gallons of water in some facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make sure your PPMs are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to write down everything you put
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your filter is clean and then
you hit go on the pump and you turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: valve for the right room and make sure
that water pumps into the right room and
[SPEAKER_00]: then while it's pumping you run up and
down the rows and make sure that each
[SPEAKER_00]: emitter is spraying out some water and as
long as every plant is getting water
[SPEAKER_00]: you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let it spray until all that water is
empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: While those plants are getting fed you
walk through and you make sure all the
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters are working but also be looking
for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be looking for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be looking for something that just doesn't
look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the problem in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something that can be fixed
or corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in the room looking for that while the
sprinklers are running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also catch a little bit of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch some of the runoff that comes out of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that comes out of the bottom of
the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure the EC of that and start writing
that down and in the future we've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can diagnose problems by what you have
written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about in the journaling episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the sprinklers are running that's
all you need to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking on the plants and catching a
little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we freed up a lot of time to work the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to spend all day watering
and while the plants are getting watered
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually in there looking for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making sure the emitters are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we freed up a lot of time and we're
still getting plenty of work done while
[SPEAKER_00]: we're watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage to having an automated
or assisted watering system is this will
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that all of your plants get
evenly watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have one plant that got two
pitchers of water dumped on it because
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody got a text message in the middle
of watering and the rest of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: only got one pitcher of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't get a row of plants that got
skipped because you were doing a job and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you saw something that had to be
fixed and you went and corrected that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then came back and moved on to the next
row and totally forgot to water or water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will get evenly watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also help reduce waste in water
and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running a large facility
you're using a lot of water and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help reduce waste and this will
also help you save on nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have an employee spraying like I
said earlier two gallons into this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallons into this pot, four gallons
into this one when they all honestly only
[SPEAKER_00]: needed two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be consistent and you won't have
guys wasting water which is wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright another thing that will help not
only are they going to get the same amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of water but they will get evenly watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have a guy just watering one
spot of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've seen a lot is when you have a
crew watering plants with watering wands
[SPEAKER_00]: and it takes them all day to water the
whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start working and then eventually
they just set the tip of the wand right on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant right on the soil and they just
hit go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how long they got to count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 30-45 seconds you count and
then the plant will be sufficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: watered then you move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of shit won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use emitters the guy won't set his
water wand right there and water that one
[SPEAKER_00]: circle real heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emitter will spray the entire surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get water throughout that whole
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots will grow through the whole
entire space of the container and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the media not just down low where all the
water got saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get evenly watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get watered all the way through
where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get saturated and it will reduce
your amount of waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage to using one of these
systems is that the emitters and the water
[SPEAKER_00]: wand actually do add a little bit of
oxygen to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those bubbles are a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more oxygen in your water the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more oxygen in your root zone the
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots love the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emitters they put out that little
mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are little bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of air making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of space between the bubbles means
there's a lot of air making it down into
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the watering wands they make a couple
of nice little shower patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those get a lot of air down into the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants do enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also add an air pump if you want
to add some sort of air stones to your
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir or to your trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add oxygen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will thank you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never go wrong adding more oxygen
to the water in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right those are the basic advantages
to using an automated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using an automated system or a drip system
or an assisted watering system is not an
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse for laziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier there's plenty to
inspect and look at and check on.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the watering system is happening you
can also inspect the watering system
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure there are no leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the filter is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the emitters are spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the water draining to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a drain set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that clogged?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting water all over the floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many other tasks available
that you just made time to get done by
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes people have an automated
system or a drip system set up to water
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants for when they go on vacation or
if they've got a leave for an extended
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they've got an emergency or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like imagine being sick and you're not
able to water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one time I had the flu real bad and I
couldn't even stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I stood up I would puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a real challenge watering the
garden that day for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had an auto watering system I could
have just filled up my reservoir and then
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the button and those plants would have
got watered and I could have went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: bed and not felt like shit for those hours
it took me to water my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of a random use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to throw out examples of
why they're useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you wanted to go away you
wanted to go to Vegas for a few days and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little bit of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go on a fish tour for a week
and have a little bit of fun but you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop at home that might die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't trust anybody around to water
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need anybody coming in and out
of your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe nobody else knows about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up a small watering system
that will take care of those plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: you while you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also auto watering systems could be
helpful for people with physical
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you're unable to lift a lot of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't carry the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your mobility is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're in a wheelchair and you can't
roll between each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got limited mobility in some
sort of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on but this
could be a way that you can grow some
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have somebody come help you once a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe set up your grow for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your drip system set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your reservoir set up and then all you
have to do is go in there and press the
[SPEAKER_00]: button and you can water those plants
every day and that way you can tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can minimize the physical work that
has to be done and you can still grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of cannabis for yourself if
you're physically limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be useful for that sort of a
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also these setups are customizable and
expandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I'm going to teach you is just
from my limited experience building drip
[SPEAKER_00]: systems in commercial grows and in home
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that these are rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can expand on this any way you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can customize this any way you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be totally wrong for your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've sparked some ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've started an argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to show you what I'm doing
and get you started and then you can build
[SPEAKER_00]: it perfectly for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's honestly easier than you might think
to build an auto watering or an assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step to building anything or
upgrading anything in your grow is to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a solid plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put this plan on paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Draw the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what you're thinking so that you
can share it and we can work on it
[SPEAKER_00]: together and we both know the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal and also have a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your what's your purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you trying to build a watering
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to make it easier?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to be able to go on
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know why you're doing it and what
your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's build a plan on how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about how many plants you want
to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you watering one light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have nine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have 12?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have 16 plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to water a whole bunch of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a four by eight table with
maybe 12 or 24 plants in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a whole row of shit with 125
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about how many sites we're
gonna need.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many emitters do we need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also think about are we going to use
emitters or do we want to use a water
[SPEAKER_00]: wand?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small system and you like
being interactive with the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: a water wand is not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice and personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going from hand watering to a
water wand, you're still gonna save time
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're still gonna get that
interactive feeling with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be in there touching each
plant, watering each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get near each plant with the water
wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to move the leaves off the
bottom surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get to the soil and then you'll
have to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still get to play with the plants
if you use the wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small system, that's a
great way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bigger system,
I would definitely recommend using the
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've made your decision on the
water wand or the emitters, then it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw and design and actually build your
watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna start with building a watering
wand and a can watering setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I would recommend for a small
to medium sized home grow or a small
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow or maybe a small or large
veg room for a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my reservoir, I use a Brute trash can
from the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a brand new, cleaned out trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a 25 or 32 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a 32 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a Rubbermaid trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Brute right on the side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measured out to where 10, 15,
20, and 25 gallons go, so I know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how far I'm filling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the hardware store right next to these
big trash cans, they sell the little
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels that attach to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can fill your can up and you can
roll it to wherever you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it closer to the plants or you
can get it over to the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just much easier to handle when
you've got that thing on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that sometimes it can be hard to
fill this big ass trash can because your
[SPEAKER_00]: bathtub, the bathtub water comes out real
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the word for that thing where
the bathtub water comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bathtub water, the faucet,
there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is real low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down there by the bathtub so it could
fill the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then up top, the shower head's up real
high and you can only adjust the angle so
[SPEAKER_00]: much unless you've got the kind that comes
off and you've got the masturbator shower
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're going to have a hard
time getting the water into this
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the hardware store, I found a thing
that is used for washing your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog washer screws in where the shower
head goes and then it adds an extra port
[SPEAKER_00]: with a hose coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take off the shower head,
you screw in the dog washer, then you
[SPEAKER_00]: screw the shower head right back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only adds about an inch worth of length
onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even notice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's got a port coming off the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this dog washer hose comes
off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other dog washer hose has a shower
head on it with an on and off switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically turn on the shower and
then the water starts coming out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: dog washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the dog washer is just a shower
head on a fucking hose so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drop that right into your
reservoir and you can fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it so much easier for me because
my shower, it wouldn't spray into the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir without hitting the floor and
the bathtub one is way too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I feel like I'm trying to
describe something crazy and I probably
[SPEAKER_00]: sound like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get to this point,
you're going to go, oh, that's what he
meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's eight feet off the ground and
this one's two feet off the ground and my
[SPEAKER_00]: trash can is about four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I should mention this thing didn't
mess with my shower at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you pop off the hose for the dog
washer, your shower just becomes a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't disrupt your shower setup at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend that you remove the dog
washer attachment, the whole hose part,
[SPEAKER_00]: just take it off up there at the port.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you leave it hanging for too
long, that tension that it creates just
[SPEAKER_00]: from gravity just swinging there for so
long, after a while it will develop a leak
[SPEAKER_00]: right there where it connects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's going to be so much easier
to fill your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use this thing to clean things
because my shower head in that shower
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attached to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I needed one that I could pull off and
I just clean stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of use it like a little dishwasher
and I just wash a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a thing in the bottom of that shower
so nothing goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's a random side note,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a fucking MacGyver in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always have to buy something
that says grow room on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always have to buy something
from one of the grow companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always have to come from
Hydrofarm or Sun Systems or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can re-appropriate different items.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just used a dog washer to clean my pots
and fill my reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what I also did?
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned the dog with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I better stay focused because
I've got a lot of notes and I'm only
[SPEAKER_00]: through the first page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part, if you're using RO,
you'll need to get the water into the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir that you can drop your mandi
pump into.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about a mandi pump
here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using RO water for either
system, the water wand or the emitter
[SPEAKER_00]: system, you're going to need a way to get
that water into your reservoir that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get a pump into that we can mix
the nutrients into and then feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may already have it pumping into a
large reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you've got set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what your grow looks like
now, but you're going to need to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: that RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to use RO water,
you're going to need to get that into this
[SPEAKER_00]: big reservoir that will then feed to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that while you're designing
your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the source water to the reservoir
is something that is often overlooked by
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room designers, by contractors,
everyone's like, so then we run the water
[SPEAKER_00]: from the res to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go, where does that water
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, oh, shit, we never piped water
into here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just trying to remind you now,
think about how you're going to get either
[SPEAKER_00]: your municipal water or your RO water into
your reservoir so that we can mix it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and then finally get it to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got the water to our
trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, we're going to be calling that a
reservoir now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is now a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're using a fancy expensive
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to budget for,
whatever you can fit through the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those reservoirs don't fit through
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it fits through your doorway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can get it into your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get your res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it filled with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how much water is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is how I get the water to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a small sump pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow stores carry the pump called the
Mondi that I keep talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Mondi half horsepower sump pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pumps are great because they come
with a three quarter inch garden hose
[SPEAKER_00]: grommet attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is screw on a garden
hose and you're ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like those Mondi pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a trash can on wheels with the
Mondi pump in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I attach a standard garden hose based on
the length that you need to reach your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the cans on wheels so we can move
it, but also the pump needs to be plugged
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need an extension cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a longer hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you've got to do thinking on
your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna roll that can down the aisle
with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna have a whole bunch of hose
to coil up and drag that hose all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your electricity for the pump
coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things to keep in mind right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a rolling can that's marked
for volume so you know how much water is
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a Mondi pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the half horsepower Mondi pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really common at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search Mondi sump pump half
horsepower, you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pops up on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at every grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your rolling can marked for
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your pump in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your regular garden hose coming
off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need some way to control the flow
and direct the water because once you plug
[SPEAKER_00]: in that pump, the water is just gonna
shoot out of the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be no control of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't turn it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can crimp the hose, but other than
that, it's just gonna keep flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need some way to control this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part is where we get the water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the thing at the end of the
hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when your old man would be out
there watering the lawn, got the beer in
[SPEAKER_00]: one hand, cigarette in the other,
and that sprayer, just watering the lawn,
[SPEAKER_00]: just spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawn was wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just out there spraying because he
didn't want to be around everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just out there watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that thing that he had to water
the lawn with?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically that thing, but longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a longer nozzle on it that you
use to aim the water and control it to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the pot so that you're not just
spraying randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It directs it into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an adjustable shower head on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put it on fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put it on shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a bunch of different settings
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like the shower version.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it to go faster, take off
that, unscrew the cover that changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: settings and it'll just come out real
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call that the dump truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it just flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut down the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still useful because you use that
water wand as an off and on switch and it
[SPEAKER_00]: reaches into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice extended arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that's for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use that thing, the water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you can get them on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them at the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get these water wands in a lot of
different styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I think is you really get what
you pay for when it comes to a water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a cheapo, it's gonna fall
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The off and on trigger is gonna break on
you really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a good expensive one,
you'll feel the difference in the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and the trigger and the off and on switch
and the overall construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just be able to tell it's better
made and it will last you longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that some of them are
adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times where they're adjustable,
they like to become leakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are too short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the kind that you can pivot the
head or not pivot, but at least change the
[SPEAKER_00]: angle of the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are kind of hard to squeeze
now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have good squeeze power,
if you're not into squeezing a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger, you might want to find one that
takes a little less squeeze power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like the one that's got the
lever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull it up and then it's on and then
you push it down and it goes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You adjust the flow by using that lever
how high up and down you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn it on to about three quarters of
the way and I can get from this pot to
[SPEAKER_00]: this pot quickly enough where I don't even
have to turn it off, where I don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I spilled enough water on the floor
or anywhere to actually be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got it set to about three quarters
and I'm just water this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it as long as it needs and then just
jump right over to this one without even
[SPEAKER_00]: turning it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I'm ready to go when I'm
done and I want to carry the wand back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the hose, I just hit that off switch all
the way and I'm not spraying water on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I've got to do some work on a plant,
if I decide to defoliate that plant while
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it or reposition,
I can just turn it off real easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water ones are really handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different varieties
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the grow store, go to the hardware
store, look at the one you like or order
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that looks the best to you on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically my auto watering system with
this water wand is I've got a trash can on
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've marked it for volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill it up to my desired level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add and mix my nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pH my solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I adjust the pH to about six,
four, six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what I'm feeding,
what plants are getting fed, I adjust my
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assemble the pump and my wand,
which means I've got a pump, I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: hose and I've got a water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put a little bit of
plumbers tape in there anywhere on any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those threads to make sure they seal up
real well, feel free to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then drop that pump into the water and
plug it in and you can water your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may suggest that before you drop that
pump into your reservoir that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to water plants with, maybe you put it in
another container and run water through it
[SPEAKER_00]: just one time just to see if there's any
oils or anything left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something in there from the
manufacturing process that you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe clean it off one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of recommend cleaning shit out one
time before you use it in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run some clean water through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure it's not going to get oil
or anything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen one of these pumps, not a Mondi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it burn up in a reservoir and a
bunch of oil came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it all float to the top of the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Brian and I weren't paying attention,
we may have fed that water to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: could have fucked up an entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a good idea to rinse that pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's got something on it,
but it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put everything together, drop that pump
into the water and plug it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can water your plants by picking
up that water wand and squeezing the
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger and pointing it right into the pot
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't have to go back to the
reservoir between every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to carry a pitcher of water
from the reservoir to the plant every
[SPEAKER_00]: time, which is trips back and forth,
which is you spilling water, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistent watering, which is you
getting in a rush, which is where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys excuse me for all the throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to do a lot of pausing and
editing on this show, but my throat is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a break here in a
second, take a drink and a dab and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been talking a lot about
consistency with auto watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a way to dial this in with your
water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you watering with before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you using a pitcher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you using a jar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you using one of those fancy watering
cans from Target?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you were using, get your watering
wand, set that container on a table and
[SPEAKER_00]: set a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or count, just count because you're going
to be doing this on your own in your head
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're out in the grow, when you get
away from all the stuff and you got your
[SPEAKER_00]: earbuds in, you're going to be doing it in
your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that container and use your water
wand and just start filling it and count
[SPEAKER_00]: how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Count at your own pace, but count at the
same pace all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you count at one, two, three,
four, five, make sure you always count
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you count at one, two, you can
count at your own pace right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just measuring at your own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you count the same all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see how long it takes to fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, maybe it'll take 45 seconds to
fill up that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the container you were using to
water your plants, now you know it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: the count of 45 to water your plants with
that water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to go stand there for 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, but make sure you're
moving that water wand around the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole time so that you're moistening
all of the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole container needs to be evenly
watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to dial in how much
water you're giving per plant with the
[SPEAKER_00]: water wand system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our basic shopping list to set up this
trash can water wand system is a trash
[SPEAKER_00]: can, wheels, a Maundy pump, a good hose,
and a solid water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to set this up for
around $200 depending on where you find
[SPEAKER_00]: the pump, how long of a hose you get,
the quality of the water wand,
[SPEAKER_00]: and do you need the dog washer attachment
to get that water to your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for right around 200 bucks,
you can be water watering your plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: much more efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my throat is mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna press pause for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a couple gigantic dabs of
this cam brulee sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get some water and then I'll be
back to talk about building a reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: and emitter style drip system for your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about building an auto watering
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, we try to
automate as much as possible to allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: more canopy work, defoliation,
bug scouting, whatever else needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done that day, a lot of cleaning,
and whatever else we come up with on the
[SPEAKER_00]: daily to do list, we'd like to have time
to get all of that stuff done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use a water wand and a can set up for
our veg and moms in a large.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we move into the flower rooms,
every plant has an emitter or two for
[SPEAKER_00]: automated watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Designing your watering system is going to
vary greatly depending on your current
[SPEAKER_00]: gross setup and your ultimate goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember earlier we talked about having
goals this setup should give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of how to start your design.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to modify and adjust and
adapt to your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your grow room looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your room is shaped
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many plants you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to make some decisions on the
fly because your grow rooms and the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardware store are going to be different
than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's available at your
hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not shopping on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you've got access to
that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you live somewhere that aces the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't go to Lowe's or Home Depot
and they've got different stuff than what
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to do some adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just going to be a good
guideline in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's start with a little bit of a
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants do you plan on watering
and how often do those plants need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: watered?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water will that require?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we need to start with a reservoir
large enough to water the garden the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you're going on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just hypothetically say your goal is
to get this through a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're leaving Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be back Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the plants to survive through the
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water will that take?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times are your plants going to be
requiring water to last Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
and you're probably not going to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: them until Saturday, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to water them Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got five full days.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many gallons of water do you need for
those plants to survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your reservoir that you select
is large enough to handle that much water
[SPEAKER_00]: if that is your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on filling your reservoir
every day and mixing nutrients and just
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding your daily feed, make sure it's
big enough for one or two feeds and you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you plan on leaving town,
you're going to want a big reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm talking about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the reservoir size that you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a small, brute trash can is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want 50 to 100 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, it's got to fit through
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go somewhere in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to get into your facility
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you've got room for a big ass
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two fifties, those square two
fifties, they don't fit through a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a roll up door or something to
get that bitch in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind also that you're going to
need to get water to this reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned earlier, sometimes
that's not as easy as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you've got a 250 gallon reservoir,
that may end up in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may end up in an easier place to
access and the grow may be down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite end of the house in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get water to the
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to get it all the way back
to the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all starts with the reservoir and a
way to get water into our res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may need to heat or to cool that
res depending on where it is stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's out in the garage, the
temperatures are going to fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a hundred and something degrees
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water would have been really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have wanted to cool it down in
the winter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit in the indoor facilities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heating water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets so cold outside that the water
that comes in through the pipes is
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculously cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in at like 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick your hand in that 50 degree water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost fucking hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to heat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get that water around 70,
75 degrees before we feed it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes them much happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a hydro system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you do want your water cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't correct me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about this drip system
for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to get the water to the right
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to heat or chill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a chiller or a water heater
and be careful with those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial them in to the temperature that you
do desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may need a smaller pump inside
of your large reservoir to help keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution mix properly and to
prevent that water from getting stagnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a little like a fish tank pump or
something in there just to keep the water
[SPEAKER_00]: moving around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got a reservoir that we can
mix our nutrients into.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fill up with either our water or
municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get water to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's the first part is having a
reservoir filled with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we need a pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pump size is going to depend on the
amount of plants, the amount of emitters
[SPEAKER_00]: and how far your water needs to travel to
get to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going up, if you have to pump
uphill straight up, you need a much
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger pump than if you're just pumping
horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pumping vertical, you need a
stronger pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of pressure to push water
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just going horizontal or
down, you can use a less powerful pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pump is going to depend on,
like I said, the distance and the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more emitters, you're going to need
a stronger pump, longer travel,
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger pump, vertical climb,
much stronger pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to think about this
when you're designing your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little research on horsepowers of
pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to have too much pressure as
opposed to too little pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low pressure won't work at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too little pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those emitters basically regulate
themselves unless you're going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to blow it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just a little bit too much pressure
and those little emitters will regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself themselves and you'll be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so far, it's pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a pump and you've got a
reservoir and make sure that reservoir is
[SPEAKER_00]: fillable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got a way to clean that
would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just keep that sort of stuff in mind
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where it starts getting into
some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run PVC from that submersible pump
to an inline filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, this is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run PVC coming up directly up off of the
pump, then use two 90 degrees to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: go back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes up and then it goes around the
edge of the reservoir or the trash can and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it goes just straight back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may need to add some distance here
if your reservoir is wide or if your pump
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the middle and then it comes up and
then you go a 90 degree and then you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go a couple feet to get off the
edge of that reservoir and then you do
[SPEAKER_00]: another 90 to go down toward the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on your way to the ground,
that's where you're going to put that
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That filter is going to...
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shine or whatever sediment you've
got coming through the line, the thick
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, will get caught by the inline
filter and it will make it down to your
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters and clog up your emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the line, the PVC line that was
coming to that filter was running down
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep running that to the ground until
you get to the floor and then use a 90 to
[SPEAKER_00]: point at whichever direction you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got a long way to go or if
you're going into another room,
[SPEAKER_00]: just simply use PVC to route it to where
you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do some plumbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work, build yourself a little water line
to wherever you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use 90 degrees, 45 degree angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you prime and glue every
spot carefully so that you don't get any
[SPEAKER_00]: leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just build yourself a little pathway to
get that water to where you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this PVC I'm talking about can vary in
size based on your watering needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere from one inch to one and a half
inch to three inch PVC could be used
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size of your garden and
how much water flow you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a large facility,
you may be pumping this water a long
[SPEAKER_00]: distance just from your reservoir all the
way down the hallway, all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room around the corner out to where
it gets dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then down to each table, you're going to
need a stronger pump for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure your pump is equipped for how
much water you're moving and the distance
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to set up different rooms
with the same pump, just use ball valves
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a, it'll come from the pump
up to one valve and then you'll have three
[SPEAKER_00]: on and off switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just turn the ones off where you
don't want the water to flow and the water
[SPEAKER_00]: off where you want it to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can select which room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just use ball valves to control the
flow to each room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use tees and ball valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can have one pump that
you can water every room from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll have to do one room at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got a big reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got a pump inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pump has hose coming off of it that
gets us to a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That filter will save your life in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, it's going to save you so much
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to rez with the pump leading
to a filter from the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got PVC leading us to the plant
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this description is how I do tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about building the tables and
adjusting this to a floor plan or other
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get the general idea down,
but this is how I do it using greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: style irrigation tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are in three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting on tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tables are slightly slanted toward the
water runs down to one end and it drains
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never have water sitting on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about getting the pump
pumping water into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I've got the water coming into the
room about seven feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's above my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pipe running horizontally
across a lot of the facility, just running
[SPEAKER_00]: water all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, eight feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it comes into the grow room about
seven or eight feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just for my setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you how we do it in a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: About eight feet high, the water,
there's a water line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see it a PVC tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a thick PVC tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're running a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours doesn't need to be this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for each table, there's a T coming
off of that main line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a T comes off and off of that T,
I use flex hose that fits off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that flex hose arches from the eight
foot, seven or eight foot spot above my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates an arch down to the end of the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is out of my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk under that because it goes
right at the end of the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just bends perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm just walking under a little
bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's seven or eight feet above me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just arches to the end of the
table where it comes to another T section.
[SPEAKER_00]: That piece of flex hose then reaches
another T intersection where I have about
[SPEAKER_00]: a three foot section of PVC that lays on
my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: My table is five or six feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use about a three, three and a half foot
section to start building my table
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a T in the very center of this
three foot section of PVC where my
[SPEAKER_00]: so that PVC just rests freely on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically sits centered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the width of the table,
but it's close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The table is five or six feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This piece of PVC would be about three,
three and a half feet long, and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: sit the width of the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is basically the start of my
water distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're doing multiple tables,
here's an important detail between the
[SPEAKER_00]: flex hose and that T intersection where
you meet the PVC, give yourself a ball
[SPEAKER_00]: valve to turn that off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to water more than if
you've got two or three tables in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you only want to water table one or
table two or table three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got ball valves to each table,
you can turn off each table and you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about watering the wrong
table with the wrong nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will come to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you can put a ball valve to
control water, why not do it wherever you
[SPEAKER_00]: can put a little union like a if you when
you start building PVC stuff, you'll learn
[SPEAKER_00]: what unions are wherever you can put a
union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not do it to save yourself some time
in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about ball valves and unions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will come into mind once you build a
couple of these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done some PVC building that
already ring stuff to you, but it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced stuff that's going to help you
out.
So
[SPEAKER_00]: so now I've got my intersection where my
water feeds, it leads into my table,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my ball valve, so I could turn it
off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget that like I almost did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It branches off a foot and a half,
maybe two feet on each side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto that, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds a little sketchy to
start, but once you see how it works,
[SPEAKER_00]: it totally makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need poly tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of your grow,
the PVC and the poly tubing you use may
[SPEAKER_00]: vary anywhere from a half of an inch to
one and a half inches, you're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to think about how much water you
need to move and how big of a pump you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use in your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get back where we were, we've got
our line coming off the wall, we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: our T intersection, then we've got our 90
degrees with our little inserts,
[SPEAKER_00]: glued into there and everything is glued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has been primed and glued all
the way back to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this as we go so we don't get
any leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is primed and glued.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our 90 degree angles pointing
down our
[SPEAKER_00]: right down between the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so right, I'm going to run mine down
the length of the table because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get it down the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to put two more of those 90
degree angles at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually 90 degree angle, you have to put
an insert in one end of it, prime it and
[SPEAKER_00]: glue it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that pops into your poly tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either prime and glue that or put
a hose clamp on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's where it's going to come
undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When two different kind of materials meet,
that's where the glue likes to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I prime and glue it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a hose clamp on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just do another piece of PVC across
the same length as the one I used at the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end, probably three feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do another one and then do repeat my 90
degree angle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I roll my poly tubing out to
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've built a square.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now basically I've got water coming
from the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes along the wall, comes into the
room, comes from eight feet above me,
[SPEAKER_00]: branches off the wall, goes down the flex
tubing, goes to the ball valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can turn off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes to the T section of PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it runs down the length of my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes back and meets itself at that
square because it cuts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere for the water to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this helps create pressure instead of
just having one line running down the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle with lines coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little bit of equalized
pressure and this will help spread the
[SPEAKER_00]: water out amongst the plants a little more
evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since we've got such a long table,
we'd rather have two lines coming off so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can have emitters off of two
different lines and not have real really
[SPEAKER_00]: long spaghetti lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just got two mains to pipe off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is where having a solid plan will
come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you drew all this out before we
started building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you measured twice, cut once
before we laid out all the tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully everything went well with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you really need to think about
where you're going to place your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to place the plants now before
you start making your punctures to insert
[SPEAKER_00]: your emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a wise move to have the plants
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done this before, if you know
how many plants fit and how much space,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can probably do the math on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would set the plants in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a table, I know that this
section this I think it's a six by no,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to be eight by six section,
I think I can fit 15 to 18 plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would think about I need to get 15
emitters in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I going to put these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put three rows of five,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to need 15 emitters,
I do seven coming off of this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so before you go puncturing,
think about how many plants on each side
[SPEAKER_00]: and think about how far apart they're
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do make punctures, you decide you
don't need, they do sell little caps to
[SPEAKER_00]: just pop right into those holes or you can
just run spaghetti line off of it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: crimp it and put a hose clamp around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine, but it's easier to
not punch extra holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emitters are going to be coming off
of quarter inch tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little sprinklers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those come off of quarter inch tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That quarter inch tubing is attached to
our main line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That line you've got running down the
table, that poly line, the emitters come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there
[SPEAKER_01]: and the stake you need to insert it into
the plant, all pre-assembled
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close to the same length.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can keep all the water
pressure the same everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get any weird over or under
watering because you've got some lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that are too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got way sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get back to where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the poly tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to puncture a little hole in
that poly tubing with the tool that they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just smack the little, you can set it
right on the tubing and then hit it with
[SPEAKER_00]: your other hand if you want to,
to make it go through or just push it
[SPEAKER_00]: right on through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit of strength,
but you should be able to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you puncture the tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you basically insert the barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might hurt your thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do sell a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use pliers, get that little barb
in there, determine how long you need your
[SPEAKER_00]: tubing and cut it to length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to cut them all similarly,
like I said, or by pre-cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always more convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then insert your chosen emitter onto the
end of that tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That emitter, like I said a minute ago,
is going to need a stake or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: platform to be inserted into your soil or
cocoa or medium of choice to keep it in
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going to stay there by
itself, a sprinkler head on a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs some sort of a support or some
sort of placer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this stuff is in the irrigation
section at whichever hardware store you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about the emitters to get
because there are a ton of confusing
[SPEAKER_00]: options and I'll tell you exactly what I
buy and then this may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the MaxiJet Maxcone Fan 360s and
those are available at www.maxijet.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual part number that I order,
because there are a lot to choose from and
[SPEAKER_00]: the descriptions are kind of vague if you
don't know what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual part number that I order from
maxijet.com is M-A-B-3-6-D-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess major, alpha, bravo,
36, delta, one, just to make that super
[SPEAKER_00]: clear because I do speak with a weird tone
sometimes, but that's the part number you
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a riser recommended on the same
page that matches that emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you need to insert your
emitter into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are similar emitters on Amazon,
but they are blue and they are 12 emitters
[SPEAKER_00]: for $19.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the same thing,
but the description doesn't give me as
[SPEAKER_00]: many details as the others I recommended
from MaxiJet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to buy as many as they
sell on MaxiJet, I think you have to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 or 100 from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon, you can get 12 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MaxiJet are the emitters I recommend,
but there are tons of other options that
[SPEAKER_00]: may work better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do sell kits that you can buy to
irrigate your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little kits that they sell to irrigate
your outdoor flower garden, those will
[SPEAKER_00]: work in your pot garden at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a small garden and you want to
experiment with something like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to build everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a fun way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we would do in a commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little kits they sell, that wouldn't
work for me in a long 45 foot table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may work for you in your small home
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those before you go building all
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be right next to all of
the stuff that I'm telling you to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be in that department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get back to where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several emitter options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, this is all
customizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like something different,
I encourage you to use what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to experiment with
emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe once you get your whole system set
up, before you start puncturing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: holes, maybe you just puncture one hole
and you have one grommet or one nipple
[SPEAKER_00]: with one line coming off of it where you
just try a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: emitter style.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just put one on, turn on the
water, see what it's like, see if you like
[SPEAKER_00]: it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the water off, pop another one on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just start comparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See which one you like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're doing that, keep in mind
that when you add multiple emitters and
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple punctures, you're going to lose
water pressure because you got pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of more spots, but you should
get a general idea of what the emitters
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure out what kind you're going to
use before you start puncturing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in your poly tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you've found and selected the
appropriate emitters that you like and
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're comfortable with and confident
in, find the appropriate risers or stakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: insert those emitters into your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I insert one emitter per plant when I'm
using a three gallon pot and I usually
[SPEAKER_00]: need to water once or twice a day and I
grow pretty large plants in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility under double ended Gavita light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: One emitter is usually enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about placing the emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to water the entire pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just want to water the left side
or the right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to stick that emitter as close to
the center of the plant as you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get it right next to the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that may be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to puncture the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to tear up the roots a
whole lot, but you want to get that stake
[SPEAKER_00]: right in there close to the center of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you turn on the sprinklers,
it waters that whole pot as much as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that when you're placing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a crew, if you've got a
staff out there placing sprinklers,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to train them on placing them near the
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I feel like we've covered most of
building a drip system or an auto watering
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten all the way to placing the
sprinklers right near the stock of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap a little bit and then we will
dial this system in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you start, like I said,
measure everything multiple times before
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got tables, make sure you cut
your tubing to the right length.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing along the floor,
make sure you cut your tubing to the right
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure twice, cut once, then you'll have
to buy the supplies one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times have you cut something too
short and had to go back to the store and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy new shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe draw yourself a good plan before you
get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a helper, go over the plan
with them so you both know the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're confident, measure,
cut and assemble your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you glue everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're confident everything is primed
and glued and all your hose clamps are
[SPEAKER_00]: secure and that you've got all your
emitters in place properly, then it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time to test your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill up your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug in your pump and then go run down to
the grow room and see if the water is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check for leaks all along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work your way all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if anything is leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for water on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know if it's leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go pay attention to every emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the water is coming out of every
emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to identify and correct
your problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already put the plants in
the room to judge your spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: now is the time to put the plants in the
room and start sticking those emitters in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have basically completed
setting up an auto water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a couple of different
things now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want this system to water at a
certain time in the morning without you
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have this just when the lights
come on, you can make this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to be there when this
happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: To make this happen when you're not there
is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your reservoir with the desired
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your pH and your PPM set how you want
to have a mix pump in there so that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps stirring through the night so
nothing gets settled so that it just stays
[SPEAKER_00]: stays cycled up all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then have a timer on your pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your light comes on at nine at nine o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that pump trigger too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it'll just run that water and
it'll water your plants for you while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at work while you're on vacation
while you're sleeping right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing you're going to have to do
is dial in how long you run that pump
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you just turn it on and let it
run, it will run until it's out of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 20 gallons in there and it
only takes 10 gallons to water your room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to overflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start keeping a timer every time you water
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those emitters in there, set a little
timer, hit go on the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes your emitters are going to
get clogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have that filter down at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes little shit passes through there
and it builds up in that emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply turn off the water, take off that
emitter, get something little tiny and
[SPEAKER_00]: just poke it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just put a little pokey in there,
just something like a wire brush bristle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just poke it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I buy them in bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just have another emitter ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pop one out, pop a fresh one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put those dirty ones in a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody doesn't have something to
do, that's when they go along and just
[SPEAKER_00]: clean all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just throw that in a bucket with
some Fizan and some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it kind of clean up for you while
you're not even there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and give them a rinse and they're
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use those as your replacement
emitters next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are going to have to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention every day to clogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clogged emitters because your plant will
not get watered if that emitter is
[SPEAKER_00]: clogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pay attention to a clogged emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall your plants should really love an
automated watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more even.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to get the right
amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should like it because you're going to
save time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to save energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to save water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably save nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see an increase in production in
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see an increase in performance in
your plants and you'll have time to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those details I tell you about
that you say when am I going to ever do
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do that right after you
get this drip system dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up as many of those in a row
as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set them up as many wide as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a basic four by eight botanic air
flood tray on cinder blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cinder blocks are a little bit taller
than a five gallon bucket so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: slide the bucket under there to catch the
runoff and then you can just run your poly
[SPEAKER_00]: tubing right down these four by eight
tables like I was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys you can make these as ghetto or
as fancy as you'd like and they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it works for you, that's what
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build a trellis system around it
by putting PVC pipes in a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that five gallon bucket up with
cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go get some quick Crete from Lowe's
or Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour it right into the bucket and just let
it harden right in the bucket there with a
[SPEAKER_00]: pole, a PVC pole six or eight feet tall
sticking right out of it and now you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a steady pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those in each corner and then just run
your trellising on there and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really affordable way to make yourself a
greenhouse style flood table with an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system and then you can go ahead
and throw trellising bars up on there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really affordable and it'll work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to look super fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright you guys don't be afraid to
adjust, adapt and customize any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I said in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might need longer or shorter tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need thicker or skinnier tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need more emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like different sprinklers than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a good idea of how to get it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does sound a lot like a lot of work
and it does sound kind of intimidating but
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise that once you go to the hardware
store and you get started and you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: pump in your hand and you're like I've got
the start then it's all going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: together so easily and it will be a fun
project for you and a friend I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let a little work scare you away
from automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that hard and it will pay
off huge in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright you guys I've got a lot more stuff
written down but this episode is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be an hour long so I'm going to wrap it
