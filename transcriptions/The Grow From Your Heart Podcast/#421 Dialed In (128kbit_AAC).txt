[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 421 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to add fresh new genetics to
your garden and I highly recommend Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Elite Seeds and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Han Solo
Burger live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is a blend of GMO
cookies and Larry O.G.F.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: They describe the aroma and flavor as
lemon sugar cookies and diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I crack it open, that is a completely
accurate description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like you had some Mayer lemon
cookies and you tried to smuggle them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the gas tank of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consistency and texture are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little dollop of nicely
golden yellow cake frosting right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful concentrate from our friends at
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out for the Han Solo Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gross and kind of delicious
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't get enough of this aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to press pause and take
another dab right now, but let's move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some shout outs for our friends
from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to my friend,
Stabby McStabwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a giant shout out to Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Farmer John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a giant shout out to my friend,
Chicago Dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a big shout out to our friend,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
a giant Viking handshake to our friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Grim Bull the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody who has supported
the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to become a
patron, you can do so by going to patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for the huge
response to my 420 episode and the giant
[SPEAKER_00]: push for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the days leading up to 420,
I released quite a few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great response,
a lot of reaction from my friends on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give everybody a big thank
you for all of the words of encouragement,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the thanks, all of the high fives,
everything that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support for the 420
episode and for the push for 420 is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big thanks to everybody who sent me
messages telling me what 420 means to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few that didn't make it to
the show because you guys are potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't send them to me until the
day of 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already recorded the show,
which is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use them in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear what 420 means to you in an
upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to gather a few more of those
and we'll play them all in one show in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody who
contributed, supported, listened and
[SPEAKER_00]: responded to the 420 push and the 420
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really means a lot to me to get all
of the listener responses and listener
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the show crushed it on iTunes and
Stitcher in the past couple of weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get emails letting me know where I stand
in the rankings on iTunes and in Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were doing extremely well in the
lifestyle and health category on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in the low 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit about 69 at one point, but we got
about 45 and 50 for quite a while there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on iTunes, we were ranked 44 in
the education category on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is big because iTunes is the
number one possible podcast provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were number 44 in a specific
category there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody who is
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people are catching on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the support,
all of the sharing, all of the reposting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I was on the Dude Grow Show,
the podcast has been blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you to everybody for all of
the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a topic of this podcast in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about a phrase we keep
hearing in the cannabis industry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community amongst growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the phrase dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean to have your grow dialed
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks they have an idea of what
the phrase dialed in means.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you know what it means to have
your garden dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the cannabis growing
game, we have access to so many monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: devices that we should be able to tell
what is happening in our garden at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should almost always be able to tell
the temperature, the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: are the lights off or on.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in technology, we are able
to monitor most of the critical aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow room through a handheld device or
a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to buy something and set
it up and have full access to monitor your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that aspect, it is really easy to
get your lights, your temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: your humidity, everything in that area
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get the room cycling beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a challenge anymore,
or at least it shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light should come off and on as
scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature should stay right where we
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity should stay right where we
need it if we learn how to set up our
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should not be a challenge to get the
room dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I think many growers are
overlooking is that we want to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in the room for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see happening now, a lot of people
are buying these fancy monitors and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it set up on our phone and now
we're able to sit at work or sit wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: we are all day and stress out over the
garden because we can watch these numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: and graphs move up and down on our phone
and tell us what is happening in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us have not had access to this
type of information throughout the day
[SPEAKER_00]: until very recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I see happening is many growers
are stressing really hard over the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: on their monitoring devices and we are
forgetting that the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to get the room in a certain
temperature threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to get the room within a
certain humidity threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly need the lights to come off
and on at a scheduled time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one we can't really fuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep in mind that no matter
what the monitors tell us, the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is a gauge that says the VPD
should be between here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the plants aren't happy when you
get that VPD between here and here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those monitors do not matter unless they
match with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love all of the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of the monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing long before I had access
to that and I was killing it way before I
[SPEAKER_00]: had any of those monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I was using for a monitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants give me all of the signals that
I need by watching those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see is it too hot in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too cold in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it too dry in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it too humid in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do these plants need water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not disrespecting or knocking these
monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got monitors hung up in most of my
facilities, the most common monitor that I
[SPEAKER_00]: use is the PL grow unit monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a PL minder unit in my favorite
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a PL minder unit in my breeding
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the PL minder because it tells me
what's going on when I'm away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I use those monitors for the
most is to let me know if something goes
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with my equipment while I am gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can react accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make something else trigger off or
trigger on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can diagnose the problem and figure out
what didn't happen or did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can correct that from being while
I'm away from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I know, hey, I need to end this party
and get home and fix that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hey, I need to end this party and get
out to that facility out on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of town as quickly as possible because
this monitor is beeping and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my favorite function of those
monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are great for getting a room set up
and dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice I said getting the room dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the room, let's think about
it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to generalize greatly here and
I'm going to piss somebody off by doing
[SPEAKER_00]: so, but just go with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a thermostat right there on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science likes to say that if I set that
thermostat between 68 and 70 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: humans will be at a very comfortable
desired temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you that if I set that
thermostat at 68 degrees, every female in
[SPEAKER_00]: this house is going to come and crank it
up to 72 because they're fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, women run a little bit cooler
than men from what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, heavy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a fat friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice they're sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fat people tend to run a little hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are women in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fat people in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My skinny ass is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: 68 degrees just isn't going to happen in
the summer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of electricity to get this
house to 68 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think everybody here knows that 68
degrees just isn't the actual comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ladies are going to want it around 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big guy is going to want it around 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy probably right around 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all just adjust and we accept it
because that's what we've got in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is what you were doing to your
plants in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying, hey, this is what my
equipment does.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what science does.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what Rasta Jeff said the
temperature should be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are a happy plant because you were
within this temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were within this humidity range and I
fed you this many PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to develop a relationship with
each individual cultivar and establish
[SPEAKER_00]: what that cultivar wants and dial it in
for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of make a joke like it's having a
girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each girlfriend is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one girlfriend, she probably
loves a different kind of food than
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever other girlfriend you got across
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's the other important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put them both in the same room
and make them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are probably the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep them in the environment
in which they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend monocrop one strain until
you get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would work with one strain, pick a
strain, fall in love with it, develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with that plant, figure out
what it likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to grow four or five
different strains in a room and having the
[SPEAKER_00]: room work for everything, grow one strain
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn that plant beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much nitrogen does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much Cal Mag does it want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something you can do late in
flower, early in flower to it that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it really excel, makes it really stand
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not know that kind of stuff
about that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got it mixed in a room with
seven or eight different plants and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding them all the same thing,
you're giving them all the same
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, you can't experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't ever dial in one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the room dialed in to make the
group happy, but you're never going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: one individual plant to reach its maximum
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do understand that there are
commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I grow in a lot of commercial
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your responsibility at that time is to
select cultivars that grow with very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar conditions, put them in tables
where you can run the feed through that
[SPEAKER_00]: table in one way, maybe run the table on
this feed another way, just group the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to where they work well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to develop relationships with
each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes multiple growth cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow it at least two or three
times, in my opinion, to learn anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time, who knows if anything is a
fluke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science doesn't care about one time
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time is a fluke no matter what you ask
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happened once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prove it, repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the job, the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time, if you see, oh,
it didn't like nitrogen last time or this
[SPEAKER_00]: time, or hey, I got nitrogen deficient
last time and this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, instead of getting frustrated with
this cultivar, I know that on the third
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, I need to boost up the nitrogen late
in veg so that it is available early in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, and then also continue that
nitrogen feed a little later through the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering process than I did in the
previous grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help me to not get nitrogen
deficient early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn things like that if you grow a
cultivar repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're an
experienced grower, it is still an ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to learn the plants individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop a relationship with the cultivar
you were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can isolate one cultivar and cut
however many clones you need to fill the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and just run a room of that cultivar,
that is the way to learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it two or three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are from many different parts
of the world, and we have bred plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: the farthest parts of the world we can,
from point A to point B, the farthest
[SPEAKER_00]: distance we can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bred those plants together,
so we have created many different
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements and desires for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want generally the same things,
but like I said, they're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be very strain-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also will find it is very
phenotype-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get two seeds from the same pack
that create plants that want completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about if we cross two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say if we cross, I'm going to
pick something that we all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Kim Dog, and then what's
something way different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just grabbing strains out of
midair.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cross Kim Dog and Tangy,
we're going to get some plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: very Kim Dog and some plants that are very
Tangy, and those plants want to be fed
[SPEAKER_00]: very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may find that feeding and different
traits, different requirements of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are different based on different
phenotypes within specific strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a few of the details
that you can really dial in with your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we do this, keep in mind,
if you dial in a specific cultivar in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, even in your room,
if you've got room A and room B in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same facility, things may be different in
different sections of those rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and things will absolutely be different in
the two rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to mimic exact
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in large rooms, you're going to
get microclimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about those types of things in
future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the things we can dial in,
if I take a clone, if I cut a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I cut 20 clones off of my favorite
plant, let's just say we're going to cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of clones off of my storm shadow
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put five of them in room A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put five of them in room B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give five to you and I'm
going to give five to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants, Jesse's five are going to
look all the same if he puts them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your five are going to look the same if
you put them in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ones I put in different rooms,
the ones in the same room will look the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different rooms we may see slight
variation just because of very slight
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I talk about getting a room dialed
in, it may be, when you take this cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else, it may perform differently
just within different very slight
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got a different type of light,
you're going to see different performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're augmenting CO2, you're going to
see a different performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about the things that we
can dial in in our grow room for our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, with our plants to maximize the
potential of this plant in these expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms we're building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we really need to
dial in is flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to say this plant
takes this many days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't believe the guy that grew it before
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that as a guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he says it takes 63 days, around day
58, start paying really close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that plant maybe 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude that grew it before you and told
you it takes 63 days is not a trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not get to decide when the
trichomes are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your scope, your eyes, that is what
decides when those trichomes are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: See when it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can really dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, it's less
likely that you're going to dial in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to pick things that take nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run all the nine week strains
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come down at day 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a smaller boutique grow, in a craft
grow is what we like to call it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more able to dial in these types of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowering time is something you should
absolutely nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that to the perfect day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also dial in the flush when you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take a couple of flowering
cycles because you need to learn exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how long the plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need to adjust your flush time to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can feed to the maximum feed
point and flush to the perfect flush time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to learn exactly how long they
take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you got to run the same
cultivar two or three times to get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other things we need to dial in
perfectly cultivar specific are the VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day and the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have two different desired
VPDs for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they look like right when they
wake up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there right when the lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they're telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got monitors to tell you what the
temperature and humidity were overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as the lights go on,
walk in there, look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know what the temp and humidity
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how they reacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust from there as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your monitors during the day
to tell you what the VPD, the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and the humidity are in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also need to watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there taco leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are tacoing up, it's
possibly too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the leaves drooping and acting kind of
weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be too humid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants and use the
info from your monitors to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: educated decision and then dial in the
equipment to work for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the plant to be the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is the queen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to make the queen happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job now is to make that queen happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to do that by dialing in
all of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing you can think about are
the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these plants are going to want
completely different diets than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the people around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be three or four people in the
room near you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys all going to agree on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same exact meal for lunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got three or four strains in
that room, they probably want three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four different meals, just slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, from a commercial aspect,
we can feed them all the same thing and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get impressive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine if I broke that room down that
has nine different plants in there and I
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated it to just two different strains
and I was running one table with one
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and one table with another strain
and I'd ran those for like three months
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've got several crops under my belt
of these strains specifically and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make those plants that much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pull that much more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get that much more harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get that much more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can probably get another bonus if I do
this correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your specific cultivar need more
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know golden goat can use more macro and
micro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just eats through the nutrients early
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boost her up and feed her heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things that if you feed her
as hard as golden goat, you will roast the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't put that plant and golden
goat on the same table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply will not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always a good idea to keep Girl
Scout cookie and cookie dominant crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same table together because they
like to be fed a lower pH and a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your OG Kush it together because it
likes a little extra cal mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that you will learn by
working with cultivars over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can't really learn that by
grouping them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can learn to adjust the nutrients
to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want more cal mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it want more phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need more potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to learn possibly how much and
how often do specific cultivars want
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the golden goat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes to drink, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant has got fish roots that you
could just water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't overwater a golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could throw it in the fucking lake and
let it float and it will drink the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, there is a plant that
is called cookie rack that if you give it
[SPEAKER_00]: two drops too much water, it gets droopy
and it gets all finicky and it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: acting like a little bitch for two or
three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the difference in two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put them on the same table with
an auto feed system because you're either
[SPEAKER_00]: going to completely drown the cookie rack
or you're going to starve and dry out the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to learn that those go on
two different tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't run them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the trick is if some asshole does put
them in the same room, I put two drippers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the golden goat so it gets twice as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't want to have to fuck with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow to not be a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn the cultivars and that way you
know that that golden goat is a lush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plant ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to need to water a little extra
because I'm growing golden goat and she
[SPEAKER_00]: just wants to drink it up and drink it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that golden goat probably may want a
little higher temperature than that cook
[SPEAKER_00]: or humidity than that cookie rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cookie rack doesn't want as humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little whiter leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to get PM if you give
it that much humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things to think about
cultivar wise that you can dial in for
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calamag is always something you got to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cultivar specific watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often, how much water that is going to
be cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also very medium specific,
pot size specific, but is plant specific
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about things like defoliating,
topping and training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that are very strain and
cultivar and phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take as many leaves off of the
golden goat as you took off of that cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: rack, you would piss off the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can strip them butt naked and in three
days they're spitting out way more leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: than they ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some if you strip them too
naked, the leaves don't ever come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants look sparse and shitty through
the entire grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to learn which plants can
tolerate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes here's my suggestion and it
scares the shit out of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here is the way to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those need to come out top
notch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you normally do with those so that
those work for you perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dedicate a couple of plants to experiments
if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not go crazy with them, but let's
try something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those two plants in the back of the
room are going to get grown the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: way, let's take one of the plants up front
and defoliate the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go super hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the grow,
let's weigh everything and see if that one
[SPEAKER_00]: that we defoliated weighs less or more
than the one that we didn't defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four, maybe you've got
another plant in the front you can play
[SPEAKER_00]: with and do another experiment too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe feed it a little extra something or
a little less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something or do something weird to it and
see compare that to the other plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can see if the weight is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the potency is different in the final
outcome, the only way we're going to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: things is by growing a strain repeatedly
and by having some sort of a control
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take some notes, have like a standard
way that you normally grow, then pick a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of plants and do some weird shit to
them and see how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only way you're going to
become a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to become established
and build a relationship with each
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like defoliating and topping and
training and twisting and working them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the net, things like that,
bottoming, lollipopping, those are all
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be very strain specific type of
things that you have to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like let's say the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't bottom it as much because the
bottom buds get kind of nice and dense on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the lemon Jeffrey, I would bottom
that a little bit because those little
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom buds get a little bit airy at the
very base of the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will just treat them different when
it comes to bottoming and lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst makes big giant buds
up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take a lot off the bottom because I
don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know it's going to be huge up
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know exactly how much to defoliate
that strawberry starburst to make it go
[SPEAKER_00]: kapow because if you de-leaf it too much,
you kind of slow her down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you de-leaf her too early, if you give
her time to get a little bit too leafy and
[SPEAKER_00]: then defoliate her kind of nice,
she'll keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as those leaves come back,
take them off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go stripping her like level 10 right
away because it'll stop her from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to give her five level two strips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she'll keep going for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just small things like that that you
will learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like hanging out with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all got a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all got different needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you meet those needs of each
person, each plant, we can help all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them reach their maximum potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a grower, as a farmer, that should
be one of our goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're completely satisfied and happy
with the way that your crop is coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you'd like to push your crop,
your goal, your garden to the next level,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop worrying about the gauges and
the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those really help us out, but they're not
the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pay just as much attention to the
meters and let's pay a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to the old school and pay
attention to the plants, the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, everything involved in the plant
is going to tell you what is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meters tell you what's going on in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will tell you what's happening
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A joke I made earlier, trying to figure
out what is wrong with your girlfriend by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at her Facebook status is never
going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sit down and ask your
girlfriend what is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monitors won't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plants, sit down and ask them
what's wrong and they're going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the garden, pay attention
to the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, have fun in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart, have a good time and
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the best way to produce high
quality cannabis.
