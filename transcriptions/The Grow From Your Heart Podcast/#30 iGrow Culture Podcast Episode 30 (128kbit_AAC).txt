[SPEAKER_02]: All right guys, Jesse came over and we
pretty much wrapped up the flushing and
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting and trimming section of the
outdoor lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to waste any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and get right to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World, we are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to pretty much wrap up the
outdoor grow season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse's with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both dabbed out, so we're going to
have another one of those episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab some pins and paper, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys might want to take notes for this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told that people are writing down
shit that I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of scares me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at a grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies and
I was just there to pick up a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: small random items and a lady at the
counter turned around and she said,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, I know you know the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she made me come over and shop for her
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, the solution that I gave
her, I learned from our good friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: She was trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just wanted to know which bat guano to
use late in the bloom season.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one should she have used?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I told her, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, I'm so glad I was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told her Jamaican late in the season and
I learned that from my buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope you listen to the podcast
because I told you that you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have proven that you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I've also admitted that I was only
90% sure of that when I told you that at
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn knew what she was talking about,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a good job at the Hygro Shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, go to Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some big news coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say it yet, but it has to do with
a really popular new lighting system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't even know the news yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to grill Jesse here in a
second and find out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we got to sell on the... Was it Black
Label?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Black Label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Label nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they 50% off?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10% above cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% above cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever they paid for these nutrients,
they're going to sell them to you for 10%
[SPEAKER_02]: above that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that, it will no longer carry
the line of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not a big seller for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small shop also.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't carry every single line in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We replaced it with some Botanicare
products and we already sold out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff we stocked in today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend Botanicare strongly to
everybody that I teach how to grow so that
[SPEAKER_02]: could have some small factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to carry every product they
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Them and general hydroproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you listen to this show,
I don't talk a lot about the nutrients I
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep a lot of my... That's kind
of stuff that I like to let people
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanicare doesn't pay me anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Support their new adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a venture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Their new business venture and stocking
their store with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about grow, feeding recipes
and shit, and all of it is included
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_02]: PureBlin Pro Grow, the soil-based formula.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells almost drinkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for your nutrients to smell like you
would almost... I know there's chicken
[SPEAKER_02]: shit in there, so I don't ever think about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got that stocked in now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cannabis cup-winning nutrients right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used the NC... SN91 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more their commercial line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to pay attention to what we're
trying to do, and they're also good to the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't seem to be real dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Liquid Karma is a good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add Liquid Karma to any feed
regimen and it will help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the PureBlin Tea or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vitamino is a new product that they're
putting out that is a good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got that now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fulvex and a foliar spray is a good
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And OGT.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not getting paid for any of these
free commercials we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just from our heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's high quality products that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't talk about bullshit on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time to talk about the end of the
grow season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that music was distracting both of
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's focus a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor season has been fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's stolen your shit, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to shoot anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: All except one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All except that one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you got to harvest everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you didn't get that frost on it
that one night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't cut down yet, you're a week
or two away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe three or four weeks at the most,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that or you're prepared for the
long haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a greenhouse covered and you've
got a heater out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're just out in the backyard,
it's really time to get your shit
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flushing is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that I've always wanted
to touch on on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give it however much time this
takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're feeding all of your cannabis
plants, even if you're using organics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're pouring stuff into the root zone
that is staying in the soil and your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are feeding off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to smoke whatever you're
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want that taste in your buds at
the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want potassium in your buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant actually takes up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts the nutrients where they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yes, your plants do spit out the
excess nutrients through the roots again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically shits them right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm keeping this real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we need to do now is flush the
toilet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get that poop soil out of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want clean dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're recycling your dirt,
this is a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you actually start recycling
your dirt is at the flush of an indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this works without outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to do this to every cannabis plant
you ever grow before you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 to 14 days before you cut down that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water the shit out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water it as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from then on out, only give it clean
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just clean pH if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just give it a lot of clean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water it real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a container plant, say it's a 20 gallon
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it 20 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to see pretty much you'll have
17 gallons of water come out probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drag a seven gallon pot to an area where
I have a drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will pour about 15 gallons of water
through a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Repeat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep pouring water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get however much water you can fill that
pot with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pour it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it drain through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll pour out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back in a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pour another pitcher or a bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pour more water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can set the hose in your plants,
on your pot plants, water them until
[SPEAKER_02]: you're afraid that it's over watered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not too worried about killing them
at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't over water them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That water will go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get all that nutrients off
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The indoor container plants, Jesse's
perfect on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just water that pot as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of hard to get a plant somewhere
if you're working a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get it kind of up off the
ground so it'll drain properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shop vac is your best friend if you
don't have adequate drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of you guys are growing in the
basement and you've got a dedicated
[SPEAKER_02]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set that sucker in the shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it up on two cinder blocks under the
pot so that it doesn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that creates a lot of drainage space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That water will pour right out of those
bottom holes of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a three gallon pot,
set that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a couple of cinder blocks in your
garage maybe where you can get some water
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you've got a cool backyard where
your stash is kind of hidden, don't show
[SPEAKER_02]: your pot plants to your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be real careful about bringing bugs
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to flush them real good,
always.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 10 to 14 days with nothing but water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had any nutrient burn problems,
get in there maybe a week before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can over flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you're going to do is kill
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going to run out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be starved to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drown the roots because you're giving
it 15 gallons every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flushing will help your plants burn
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll dry and cure better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll smoke better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll taste better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll smell better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever smoked pot that it almost
tastes like you just stuck your tongue in
[SPEAKER_02]: a light socket and leaves that burnt shit
on your tongue?
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably had not been flushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I can name the brand of
nutrients sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can taste worm castings a lot of times
in people's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can taste advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if you overdo a couple of things
in botanic care, I can taste it if you
[SPEAKER_02]: overdo it and don't flush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucas formula always has its own ... I
think GH always has a ... It brings out
[SPEAKER_02]: the limonene smell, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: A candy, lemony, lemon head candy kind of
a smell when you use GH.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got something that you want that
is a lemon strain and you want to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: out that lemon, feed it the general
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I don't say this a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of a secretive thing that a
lot of us know that one of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have to read a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stressing the plant with light stress and
heat will bring out limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to lemon up your lemon
strains, drop that light a little bit too
[SPEAKER_02]: close around week six of ripening and
you'll bring out the limonene terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard you say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll also stress your plants a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to adjust on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your top leaves are going to brown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we're not growing for pretty
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl Scout cookies is gorgeous right up
until about week eight and then she's so
[SPEAKER_02]: damn ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just goes, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she's pretty up close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to taste her head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: My girl's got cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag is in another room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm teasing you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out this girl's Gorilla Glue number
four nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually haven't seen anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the finished product of the Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody around here is passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like an old skunk nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or cola, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a nice shout out to Elbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does not listen to the show,
I don't think, but I'll get him to and
[SPEAKER_02]: he'll hear this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a good job with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's ready yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it smokable?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, there's a nice little prop for when
we get to curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people hate the word moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to throw in moist out there
because it does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of ranted on about flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point here is flush your damn weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that can tell can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're the ones that you want to
impress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's hydro, flushing is even more
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't really talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about hydro growing very much,
and there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have zero experience in hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about as far as I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen sparky weed from hydro weed or
from hydro systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a res full of nutrients,
you're constantly pumping that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's important throughout the
entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every couple of weeks, you should be
flushing and using one of those flush
[SPEAKER_01]: products, Clear-X.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just about to ask, how do you feel
about those flush products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily for dirt, in my opinion,
but for hydroponics, you need it to help
[SPEAKER_01]: flush your medium off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things break up salts is mainly
what they do?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all like a sugar of something,
like a sucrose of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never researched what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dancing all over the mic on Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get him honed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm turning myself down so that I can turn
you up, and it'll make a sound even.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am super fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not getting you very well on the
computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to the mic real good for me for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to come up good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep you going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to turn just you up
anymore without making it weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if he's too quiet, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flushing your plants really good is
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to impress Jesse and I with your
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way you're going to do it,
the only way you're going to win a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cup is by flushing your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you don't want to give sick people
weed with shit in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what a caregiver does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what a compassionate person does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what a responsible person does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on the other team, and you're
growing that weed that should be illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on this reason that makes
prohibition happen if you're growing weed
[SPEAKER_02]: that has not been flushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: The look on your face is like,
shit, you think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to know which side you're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even sick people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't want to put that in
anyone's body.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a horrible thing to do to someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're going to talk about de-leafing.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you flush, a few days before harvest
time, you want to get in there and take
[SPEAKER_02]: off the fan leaves, all those big leaves
that are in your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they've got what's called a pedial,
that's the stem that reaches to the large.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other people pronounce it
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tweet me and argue me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how I've read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything with the pedial, you can reach
and cut off, chop all those leaves off,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean those things out of your grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just chop them and leave them on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those bring bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed them to your chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've had a clean grow room,
you can possibly juice those if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw those right in there with your kale
and your white people smoothie.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get in there, cut off all those fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cut off some of the outer leaf if
you want, but you might want to save that
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just decide how much trichome is on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's not a trichome on it,
you can take it off right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, Girl Scout cookies,
they always have a little pedial coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, such a long one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how far it is, like you said
with hash, some of them are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep that one on there just because I
see that little bit of resin on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get greedy with resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're resin farmers, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our goal is resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if it's very long, I've cut that
sucker off, coming out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clarify that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a knob that'll turn everything up
a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cut off all those fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, while you're flushing, you've got a
few days now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know harvest is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taken off the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now's the time to prepare the harvesting,
the trimming and the drying area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back real quick to flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about the sweetening
agents molasses and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I use this shit out of molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my outdoor stuff, I start flushing
really early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually started two plants flushing
this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them two molasses feedings before I
actually start flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going into my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to keep it basic because I don't
want to steer anybody wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want everybody to learn the right steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do sort of something similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feed them enzymes, carbohydrates,
and molasses at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll get some hygrozyme as the
enzymes I prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll get the molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes maybe some yucca extract and
coconut water and sucanat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yucca extract and coconut water and
sucanat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hygrozyme on that last flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like day 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really strong mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from then out, I flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't overfeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I don't overfeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got plenty of space to flush
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drag a plant to a watering area and just
run the fucking hose on it until it's
[SPEAKER_02]: flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually just converted the old
bathroom that was in the work joint into
[SPEAKER_02]: just the flushing spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guy's got to pee with no stalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: My building doesn't have indoor plumbing.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you have all that stuff that
you're taking for granted, you're way
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead of the game sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, use it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are guys that have been growing
since before we could talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to go to the hydro shop with your
hat down in your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rent a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get looked at like, that guy grows weed
even if I'm not at the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Colorado's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've used some sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And enzymes and coconut water and some
yucca extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to use them all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use these differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: The succulent may need a little while to
break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may need something to help that
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The enzymes are going to be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're preparing the dry space,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that where we are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean up your drying and trimming space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any dust, dog hair, hippie hair,
all the crap that's on my table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of dab resin to tell you the
truth, but all that shit is going to end
[SPEAKER_02]: up in your weed that you're cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, that's just as important
as having a good flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want crap on your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just spent 70 day flowering cycle plus
however long we took to veg that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus if you're doing a pheno hunt,
you're risking, you know, you got to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: which seeds are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a big plant too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a lot of work and nervous nights into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a nice secure area while we're at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not write that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But have a nice secure area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making concentrates,
every piece of dust and hair and
[SPEAKER_02]: particulate is going to end up in your
concentrate somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even if you're blasting butane over
it, you're going to blast dog hair juice
[SPEAKER_02]: into your hash essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know technically what you're
getting, but you know, that's what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to find in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all going to end up in your
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your trimming area, your work area,
cover your table, get a plastic cloth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys use rubber gloves when you're
handling your plants, when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, when you're chopping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For God's sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen how you do fingerprints when
you commit a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're leaving oils and hippie goop and
human goop and Cheeto stains all over your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wear some rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our oils actually affect the plants for
long term storage and plants that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been handled with bare hands and break
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Faster in my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a BHO dab, you can decarboxylize a
BHO dab enough with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by rolling BHO around in your
fingers, you can decarb it enough to be
[SPEAKER_02]: edible, like processed as delta 11 THC by
your liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how, well that's like cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can do that by rolling it in
your hand, imagine what we can do to a
[SPEAKER_02]: trichome on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rupture it, ruin it, kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're leaving weird oils that are
fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said decarboloxing, I was
thinking of dewaxing and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: floating in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked me what is dewaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get a hash maker over to say
more technically what it is, but I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: explain it on a later episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing to do with explaining that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your trim room, you should have
comfy tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have some good music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going to argue over the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on the agriculture podcast episode one
and hit play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like to put up stand-up
comedian shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listened to comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly listened to a lot of Joey Coco
Diaz and Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listened to a podcast when I'm trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite podcasts hasn't posted
an episode in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little annoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up Adam Hill?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my new podcast buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to keep on track here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting into the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preparing the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: The area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gloves, comfy chairs, good music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to dry area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preparing that dry area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preparing the dry area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly a fan or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heater and or air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to need to keep it between 60
and 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go up to 75 degrees if you need
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's in your bedroom or something,
you're going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind though that heat is one of
the biggest enemies of a drying plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also you want it dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had all kinds of light beaten down
on your plants for months, but now we want
[SPEAKER_02]: it dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want those to stop growing and
degrading.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to kind of suspend the animation
right where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It protects the trichrome heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked them at the right maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want them going much further.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also want our humidity at 40% if we
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go any lower, you're going to dry
too quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go any higher, of course you risk
molds and it's going to take too damn long
[SPEAKER_02]: to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the dirty south, do the best
you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Us in Colorado, it's funny that you say
that because in the south you read
[SPEAKER_02]: stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, so when you harvest your
weed, you got to dry it for 20 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you read in Colorado,
you're like, so cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five days later, you got dried buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, oh yeah, they must be,
must be in Colorado in February.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really varies from region to region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like what side of the state
you're on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got your fan, you got your
dehumidifier, your humidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to have, if you can afford it,
if you can do it, put a carbon filter and
[SPEAKER_02]: a blower in your drying room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvesting plants stink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm choking on a dab over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvesting plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your neighbors will smell it 10 times more
than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been around them every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had just gotten done trimming and didn't
have any plants on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody came over and they're like,
damn dude, I can smell your plants from
[SPEAKER_02]: the garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I don't even have plants
at this house.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just me reeking of trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had lady in loaf and jug always
tells me I smell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just coming home from work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people at Lowe's know what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're buying weird shit smelling like
dank all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And restaurant owners always love me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got that carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you need a hygrometer that just
tells you what the humidity is and a
[SPEAKER_02]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell a great one at Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that is something you can get at
Walmart anywhere in the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowe's has remote control thermometer
hygrometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can set the unit in the room and then
you can carry the thing around with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever you're curious, you look at
the thing and it tells you, you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to run to the grow room and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad has one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a chick on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he seriously got this at Lowe's or
Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's hot, she's in a bikini.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's cold, she's in a coat and a
scarf and everything all bundled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see your dad smiling at that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put more heat on your mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got, yeah, the rooms are looking
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a place to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a place to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you need a spot to hang your buds or
your whole plants, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set up a hanging space with plenty of
space between your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a small crop, you can use a
coat hanger and put two plants on one coat
[SPEAKER_02]: hanger if they're little, like three
gallon pot kind of guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a five gallon pot,
hopefully you've made enough pots where
[SPEAKER_02]: you need one coat hanger per plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any bigger than that, we're going to need
little hanging lines from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use hemp twine and freaking hooks and
just put hooks in each end of the wall and
[SPEAKER_02]: run some twine across.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys may not have space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fishing line works good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fishing line is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any kind of string to hang it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen guys take chicken wire and make
a big cylinder out of it and that way
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got a bunch of hanging spaces at
different layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what we do at the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomato cages work great too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recycle that tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago, I harvested a crop and
dried it in the hydro hut that the crop
[SPEAKER_02]: grew in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just took out the light, flipped the crop,
hung it upside down right inside there,
[SPEAKER_02]: kept all the blowers going, kept the
carbon filter going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had the space to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's moving.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid the drying racks if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people were talking about those
online the other day when I was talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those put a dent in your ... They make a
flat side on your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make it taste longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start squishing the bud together
like that, you're messing up your
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes and your flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trapping in air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trapping in chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trapping in moisture, which is what
we try to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise chance of mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It centralizes a whole bunch of humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always felt the mesh damages the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaking around and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to poke through the mesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always end up with ... I have to put
something underneath those to catch all
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff that falls out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much that falls off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wonder, what should I do with
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that was a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what to do with it now,
but I quit using those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you make B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure where you came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is useful for if you have gigantic
plants, all the larv and the little buds
[SPEAKER_01]: that you end up with inadvertently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always seems like you have a pile of that
stuff no matter how hard you try to fight
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be mad if you chop a bud in half on
your first trim session either.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always happens occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the rooms built up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wearing rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have everything done before you chop down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be scrambling around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really when ... I've seen a lot of
good crops go right up to the point where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's time to put scissors to them and
that's when somebody fucked them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or right after you put scissors to it and
trimmed it and then put it all on a
[SPEAKER_02]: Tupperware while it was wet or hung it out
too long to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it counts, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've spent 60 days, 70 days on a
flowering crop, let's do the harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where the money happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: My aunt in a highly illegal state grew a
crop when I was younger and she didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to handle any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there was no information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: She stuck it in a black trash bag and then
hung it in her basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were swamps in the area that country
she lived in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not her basement, but her attic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Needless to say, it created a whole bunch
of mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A horrible waste of a summer's work,
especially in this locale and time era.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Risk your life for moldy buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a crazy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a boy scout when it comes to growing
your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should always be thinking two weeks
ahead in your pot plants because anything
[SPEAKER_02]: you do today, you're not going to see it
for seven to 10 days probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you've messed up on in the
season, here's your chance to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: little right of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this is the time where we are
going to get the plants and harvest them,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should also branch out to dry trim and
wet trim a little bit before we get too
[SPEAKER_02]: far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about how I harvest a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hypothetically have a three
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to drag that three gallon pot
with my three foot tall pot plant over to
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice area where I've got plenty of
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to chop the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that I do it, I chop the plant
just above where the first nodes pop out
[SPEAKER_02]: so that I don't have a lot of stick
hanging off the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unnecessary water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flip the plant upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a fuzzy stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a pipe cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wrap that bitch right around those
bottom two nodes so that I got a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: hanger and I leave some hanging off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I tied that onto wherever it's going
to hang from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different situations at this point,
I hang in different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using my main dry room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hang it from the dry line that hangs
up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hanging in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a plant that's been flushed,
de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My rooms are clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's going properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've just got this giant wet plant
that is mostly little leaves and just
[SPEAKER_02]: donkey dick buds hanging upside down in my
dry room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temps are perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were going to wet trim, this is
where wet trim and dry trim would branch
[SPEAKER_02]: off a little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to keep everybody on the same
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we go too fast because we've
done all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people are like, you skipped
four days worth of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to keep it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to wet trim, the
difference between wet trim and dry trim
[SPEAKER_02]: is obviously you let your plants dry if
you're going to dry trim and then you get
[SPEAKER_02]: in there and take the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wet trim, you would do it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've cut the plant down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to hang it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time to get in there and chop
everything off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You trim it into the bud that's going to
be smoked at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go as close as you look
like you want to because those little
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves are going to shrink up into the bud
a little, but still do a hell of a good
[SPEAKER_02]: job getting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse said earlier, I definitely prefer
dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse and I agree that we say dry
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We agreed earlier that some of those
southern states we were talking about with
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of humidity, you guys may want to
wet trim because you need to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves off of there and kind of speed up
that dry process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Colorado, there's not a lot of
humidity sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets super dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We leave those leaves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk mostly about dry
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wet trim is basically I cut the buds off
of the sticks to where I have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: hand-sized bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wearing rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to hold on to just a stem and then I
spin that bud in my hand and just slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: clip off all of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can trim it to your preference if it's
going to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to put it to market,
you got to trim that shit close.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's not a lot of trichome on that
leaf, take it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that leaf is sticking out, take it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not leaf heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pot heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to smoke pot, not leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically wet trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some patients that they don't want
it trimmed at all with their old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you should leave it on the sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it kind of on the sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cut it into two smaller parts
because you need a way to hang it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how the branch is a branch and
then there's a little node coming off
[SPEAKER_02]: where your buds grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Save one of those little branch parts as a
little hook and then you can hang that in
[SPEAKER_02]: your dry room because after you get done
trimming these buds, you want to hang them
[SPEAKER_02]: up so they don't get a flat spot in your
cure rack or your dry rack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want them hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim them up, hang them up, and then let
those dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those wet buds need to dry after they've
been trimmed until you grab them and bend
[SPEAKER_02]: the stick and the stick should pop and
snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just go crack right on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be obvious when it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on where you are, that should
take between five to maybe 15 days just
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: They dry from the outside in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outside of the bud is going to be dry
before the entire bud is actually dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too happy and jump the gun
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really going to make a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just slightly wet buds to dry buds to
properly cured buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse's learning how to use a straw here
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cough wasn't that impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The look on his face was like,
did I just cough from a straw?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you did, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wet trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hang the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people chopping the branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about a three gallon pot here,
so I'd hang the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people chop it into smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get it into just branches,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to let the whole thing hang.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it dries at just the right
speed here just because of where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: For indoor plants, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing those big outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to chop them into smaller
parts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor plants with three levels of cages
around them, that's not really an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even get out of the cage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I told somebody to cut down the
whole plant and they said, I grow a scrog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to have to cut out
branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just go with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a bunch of branches now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cutting off one branch at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hang those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dry however long it takes,
just similar to the wet trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to let them hang until right
before they snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that first part snaps, now it's time
to get to work because your stuff's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to dry slowly and you're going to catch
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a little behind in
trimming, but you'll catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially if you got a lot of work
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, you got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had that thousand watt light cranked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 52 ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to grow outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: One ounce per week is all we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a flashback to an old episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys remember that because I
got where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got these dried plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You chopped your plants down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hung them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let them dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you've cut off a stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to your drying area and you got your
stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much just take your thumbs and just
knock those little dried leaves right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a little container and have that where
you can just knock the leaves right into
[SPEAKER_02]: that container because you're going to
make some sort of concentrates out of
[SPEAKER_02]: that, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or food or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: With your gloves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: With your gloves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your gloves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to eat your skin flakes and
your fingernail dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got these buds and I kind of hold
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just picturing the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like I'm playing Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my thumbs just going and I'm just
knocking leaves off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like he's playing snake on a
Nokia phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like you're texting on the
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just holding that thing and just
knock the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see what you want to take off once
it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trim it to your preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little triangle leaves that stick
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually trimming this bud that's
sitting on the table with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little triangle leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just pluck those right off and
then pluck that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see where the bud is and where
the leaf ends if you've done it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use scissors, but it's the exact same
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl Scout cookies and Yeti.
[SPEAKER_01]: No scissors necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just roll that around in your hand and
those dried leaves fall right off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so these dried nuggets,
they're pretty much dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw those in a bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I'm done, I jar them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of where the cure process
starts for both of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once those sticks are snapping on your wet
trim, take the leaves off, throw it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: bin and they're ready to go into jars when
you're done trimming everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dry trim, now that you've knocked the
leaves off, you got that in a bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're ready to pretty much go into
jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where the curing
process would start, don't you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we skipped anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we have, but I'm really stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to get into curing on this
episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone 35, 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to get into the cure or do we
want to save that for another time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do a little homework on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we're going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Jesse for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hang out and leave the mics
on for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything you want to say while
we're on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll even admit that I had to have been
told that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to keep you out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both want to say what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The store looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this, uh, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to explain it on the
air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Attention deficit disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuck in the old school and don't like
talking about certain things, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no reason not to, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try to keep, you're going to keep the
family life and the podcast life separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saying hi to the lady at the hydro
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make the shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: People listen when you come.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel like you're an authority and you
remind me of shit that I would skip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cracks me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't told you we're getting close to
1500 listeners per episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This little podcast town is actually
making a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're helping people make quality
medicine, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the goal was.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's something I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a dab going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, dude, would you pass me the new dabs,
the golden goat?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the other paper, that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, this is, these dabs are the craziest
looking dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he tipped it when he was putting
it onto the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got this ripple look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like, uh, like the floor of a
golden, uh, pool or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like, uh, I could see a rapper
wearing a shirt with this print on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's got like a slick Rick sort of
look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see a couple of wooks staring at
that for a couple of hours on some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: weird thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about your hash bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up homies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big love to everybody at the garden of
Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I need to give while I'm thinking
about it, a special, special super shout
[SPEAKER_02]: out to my friend Doug Benson and also
comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we had the time of our lives Monday
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to brag too much,
but look at, uh, the Facebook pages and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Instagrams and the Twitter's.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a hundred pictures of me
smoking and dabbing with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you guys don't even know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool as cool as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, uh, cuss jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you need to bring up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I even just stopped myself from
saying fuck cuss jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is only, this is only a rule that
applies to me, but if the guests want to
[SPEAKER_02]: participate, they can the cuss jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I say the F word, the F word is the
only one that counts in this cuss jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if I say the F word, you guys tweet me
and remind me every time I say it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast, starting on episode 30,
that's this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go back in time and cost me money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time from now forward that I say the
F word, on a show, it costs me a dollar.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a few episodes, if I quit saying,
if I don't quit saying the F word,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will increase my donation amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll crank it up to $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after I'm not committing to any
amount of episodes, I want to see how I
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if I do the worst I do, the more
money I have to pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it'll hurt me more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dollar doesn't hurt my feelings,
but it reminds me $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go, damn, that was $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start going, this is getting
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to increase it slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a charity, um, that I have in mind
that I will tell you who it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a friend on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, we had a long conversation and he does
deserve the donations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a person who needs help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's a sick child.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will help that kid out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I say the F word, here's a buck
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a dollar coming your way just to
get it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me want to make you cuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of a smart ass way to do it,
but it cost me a dollar and it was well
[SPEAKER_02]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to send this guy a dollar for a sick
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll still occasionally see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start charging the
guests a dollar too, just for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say that one all you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a big dab here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a huge shout out to my man Task
Rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate my brand new blue,
highly educated carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that stylish bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, uh, I'm going to wrap up this part
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, that pretty much wraps up
episode 30, mostly wraps up the outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to send a huge thank you to Jesse
for taking time out of his grow schedule
[SPEAKER_02]: to come and help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the listeners really
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much respect and much love to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys follow him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Jesse grows OG on Twitter and Jesse
grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_02]: search for I grow culture, find the review
section and give me a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think of the show and
I will read your comments on a future
[SPEAKER_02]: episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll also read all the Stitcher comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher just recently updated and it is a
lot easier for me to find the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to Stitcher, leave your comments
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a five star review and I will read
your comments from Stitcher as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I like good reviews and good
ratings is because that helps us move up
[SPEAKER_02]: in the ranks, which just gets us,
which gets us seen by more listeners,
[SPEAKER_02]: which gets more people growing quality
product, which gets less shit product out
[SPEAKER_02]: on the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can improve everybody's garden by
making the podcast a little more popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode
[SPEAKER_02]: is archived on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics, colorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a big, huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a huge shout out to my buddy,
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the crew at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys take a fat dab and give your mama
a hug for me.
I'll see you guys next time.
