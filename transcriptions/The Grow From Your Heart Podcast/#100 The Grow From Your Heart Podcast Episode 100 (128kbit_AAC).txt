laughed my ass off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm laughing just thinking about it How
high was he?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the rig and I dabbed it and capped

[SPEAKER_01]: It's Right in my face.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hitting it Happening kind of wasn't

[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you've been here since you
wanna Wow, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah fishes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still remember that When they said I
remember when they announced it they said
[SPEAKER_07]: and CBD concentrate goes to and they said
oh Gita and before they finished the name
[SPEAKER_07]: of the strain I threw my arms up in the
air and I looked at my friend that was
[SPEAKER_07]: with me and I was like, that's the garden
of waiting I was so stoked for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was proud of shit When they said it cool
I didn't even realize that it was us like
[SPEAKER_00]: they said it and I like kept like saying
it over and over I'm getting my head but
[SPEAKER_00]: Spencer was like Maddie Let's go in like
my friends all started rushing up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best part is Everyone was on
stage with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great to see I was in the back
taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to see you guys up there I'm
proud of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another cannabis cup coming up in
the future Do you guys have anything
[SPEAKER_07]: planned for that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, which one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was thinking about Denver,
but Unfortunately, Cali just got canceled
[SPEAKER_04]: if we get lucky enough to have a cup of
Denver, then I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I just with the way everything's
going I don't think that stuff's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: last much longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true unless it's unless it's like
in Like I know like Jamaica, that'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not gonna touch Jamaica because
it's in a different country It's our first
[SPEAKER_04]: time they've already approved that yeah
making counsel and then I think Michigan I
[SPEAKER_04]: was looking on the website today and
Michigan has There's either Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's California the one in LA that
they do February of every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um is going to have like two weekends So
it's gonna be one weekend and then like I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know what they're doing the entire
week and then the next weekend It's like
[SPEAKER_04]: so you know things are changing with like
different states trying to allow high
[SPEAKER_04]: times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it just comes down to like
Probably how much money you want to put
[SPEAKER_04]: into it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which they're probably still paying a
ridiculous amount to you know get
[SPEAKER_04]: locations and stuff Just when you know at
cannabis cups It's usually like people
[SPEAKER_04]: giving away samples and stuff like that
Like that's money that the the tax people
[SPEAKER_04]: don't see so that's something and it's
actually written in the rules that they
[SPEAKER_07]: can't give out Samples and shit at events
like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well now is it that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody can give out samples or only
Established shops with licenses can't give
[SPEAKER_05]: out samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is when the established shops
are giving out licenses But I heard a
[SPEAKER_04]: police officer say that but you just said
he said Shops given out license.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did say that huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: License shop giving out samples is what I
think I meant Sorry, but then I wanted to
[SPEAKER_07]: talk about something else that I heard I
heard a cop say today that if I give you
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis even if I gave it to you Legally,
that's a sale.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a transaction there that was
considered they can be considered a sale
[SPEAKER_07]: even if it's a donation So there's a lot
to be careful about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, technically that's a sale
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that would just be at the cops
discretion.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what that cop said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep Yeah, so if they want to be a dick
about it They can go ahead and arrest you
[SPEAKER_07]: for me give arrest both of us me for
giving it to you and you for accepting it
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though we're both over 21 Go ahead
slot grab a microphone I should just give
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys two mics over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about like, how does that work
though?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuz we can smoke with each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true One of us leaves with
anything That's a joint, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because yeah, I mean technically like the
definition of a sale is like Mike you're
[SPEAKER_08]: the legal guy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step in Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't give direct legal advice You
really just we need more Pro marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: laws the federal law needs to change state
laws need to change I mean marijuana is
[SPEAKER_01]: legal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have pot stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still can't gather outside of Someone's
private residence and consume together
[SPEAKER_01]: legally all of that's still in a gray
market People are busted for distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: for passing joints at parties or for
having more than an ounce on them or for
[SPEAKER_01]: Buying weed that comes in multiple bags or
for owning a scale so that they can check
[SPEAKER_01]: their purchase after they buy it The law
needs to change everywhere and more people
[SPEAKER_01]: need to get political Everybody here just
got a ballot mailed to him fill that
[SPEAKER_01]: fucker out and mail it back in everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes To vote and then vote and if your
state is working on cannabis regulations,
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure you write in public consumption
facilities of some sort someplace where
[SPEAKER_07]: you can go and gather and Smoke just like
you can go and drink beer at a bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can order shots.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can order beers Let's do something
just like that in your bill when you go to
[SPEAKER_07]: legalize cannabis in your location Let's
put something for you to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere in the US already has the
infrastructure for adults to go out
[SPEAKER_01]: consume intoxicants and get home safely
Every place has bars every place
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, all you got to do is call a cab cabs
aren't gonna pull up to the pot Can
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption tavern order the fuck they
call it and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, you smell bad You can't get my car

drove around at like a wholesale level,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's regulated in some way Do they go
around in like an armored truck?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you guys all have tremendous
experience in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm i'm an outsider Just manifested from a
place of place cbd rx has trucks that are
[SPEAKER_07]: labeled cbd rx, which is a cbd company
They do they specialize in mostly cbd
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't have to ask for permission to
use a men's room It's you're headed to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a left as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really pink The restroom is really
pink but cbd rx cruises around with their
[SPEAKER_07]: label on their truck And then they have a
trailer with just covered shit on it and
[SPEAKER_07]: you can tell it's just product for days on
the trailer A lot of times it's uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to fill out a manifest before you
leave Before the product leaves one
[SPEAKER_07]: building you have to fill out a manifest
of the amount of product uh, the Car
[SPEAKER_07]: license plate the driver and and even the
route you're going Yeah, the route that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're gonna take has to be documented
because you can't be like off like if you
[SPEAKER_04]: get caught like 30 minutes off of your
path, you're supposed to go to they could
[SPEAKER_04]: like Say you're doing you know i'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just in case stuff Yeah,
so you can't stop in mcdonald's or nothing
[SPEAKER_07]: on the way even if it's like a four-hour
drive Everything here is hyper regulated
[SPEAKER_07]: guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then you have to fax that to the
med Uh like 24 hours before you leave and
[SPEAKER_07]: they have to approve it and then when you
get the product then There you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: basically do the opposite of everything
has to be assigned by the other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah It's ridiculous and then wade and
then fax that it was received.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so they really track all of the
product here in colorado They pay a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: They call it the seed to sale model Uh
from the minute that we germinate a seed
[SPEAKER_07]: in the shop It's under camera and it has a
mips number and an rf id And it'll be that
[SPEAKER_07]: rf id until harvest time and when it gets
tested because everything has to be tested
[SPEAKER_07]: When it does get a test, it'll be tested
under that rf id number There was just
[SPEAKER_01]: another bunch of recalls uh today I had
two of them up in denver two dispensers in
[SPEAKER_04]: denver gave product That had whether or
not a bpm pesticides, whatever to to
[SPEAKER_04]: another Uh to a bunch of extract companies
and it was literally probably almost every
[SPEAKER_04]: extract company like bigger extract
company in denver And they had to return I
[SPEAKER_01]: only had time to scan that one before
today's meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the list of stuff That's getting
recalled is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the cannabis recall work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they do the customers that purchase it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they bring back their product?
[SPEAKER_07]: They can take it back to the dispensary if
they've purchased it No, it could be their
[SPEAKER_04]: exchange or a refund all the products have
a batch number on it So they can identify
[SPEAKER_04]: like which batch it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look on your jar and it has blah
blah blah blah and then hopefully you
[SPEAKER_04]: ain't smoking All already, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's there's also two lawsuits for
people who ingested That could be a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuits coming around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah But it's gonna be years before these
people find out if they got sick from any
[SPEAKER_07]: of the things that they smoked and then
How can you say that it was this batch of
[SPEAKER_07]: hash right here?
[SPEAKER_07]: They got you sick after we've done a
million dabs in the past five years test
[SPEAKER_07]: dummies Yeah, we are that's honestly
you're you were kind of kidding,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we are the hash test dummies any Bad
things that are coming from this cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: use the way that we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna discover them with us Yeah,
it'll be our generation in this movement
[SPEAKER_07]: that does discover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say either way I was extremely
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all that really matters,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just put down the rest of that Pumpkin
pie delight bar and it was actually super
[SPEAKER_07]: delightful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am delighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a one piece left.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think anybody can have if we need to
crack open more There's a strawberry
[SPEAKER_07]: crunch that I've never tried and I know
that the monkey bar is delicious I only
[SPEAKER_01]: want to eat it because it tastes good
Other reasons do you eat things because
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically the medication?
[SPEAKER_05]: To get me higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I'm like I don't need to get any more
high but man that things taste how many
[SPEAKER_07]: how many milligrams have you had so far?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm 50 in right now.

edible eater Oh, man, I usually save this
[SPEAKER_05]: much for a place in the mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some capsules in the car 300
milligram to TV capsules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, if you want to have fun,
then we want to have fun I'm not eating
[SPEAKER_04]: them.

like I can barely like move my arms and
[SPEAKER_00]: where I sleep for like a solid 12 hours
when I actually do fall asleep I can't be
[SPEAKER_08]: doing that The first time I ate a hundred
milligram bar I had to like go lay on the
[SPEAKER_07]: bed and gather myself I was like,

buddy Jesse.

turned to green Lay down on the couch over
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a break Yeah, big shout out to Jesse.

Clinda After that after that we might
[SPEAKER_07]: switch that email over here to the little
hit man because it hits a little better in

rip That's pretty that's pretty nice right
[SPEAKER_07]: for a mothership knockoff Like I did.

like you mean that knockoff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everybody go check out It's not a
mothership so it wasn't 2,500 bucks and it
[SPEAKER_07]: hits just like a mothership so it was
worth the 250 or 200 or whatever It was a
[SPEAKER_07]: knockoff, but I mean it's fucking it works
the same.

[SPEAKER_07]: the edge off You get we won't even ever
eat acid on this podcast you guys that's
[SPEAKER_04]: not gonna happen I'm like, you know,

[SPEAKER_07]: did you went pee a minute ago?
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a fun night.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a fun night for everybody,

t-shirt and I almost threw up almost threw
[SPEAKER_08]: up I've almost thrown up both times the
one time That Michael did it was during

dab stood up in the middle of his house
[SPEAKER_08]: Took my shirt off and lay down on the
floor Yeah, yeah, sometimes you just need
[SPEAKER_07]: a little rest or after a big dab like that
I think that if there were to be a dab

standards would probably be myself and
[SPEAKER_04]: Maddie I'll be the first person out.

does not take big dabs He likes take a

[SPEAKER_08]: I see it on YouTube all the time people
dunking It's like the most shameful way to
[SPEAKER_08]: dunk on somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you meant like really When I was
when I was like in 10th grade at the
[SPEAKER_04]: summer before my 10th grade we were
playing in a basketball tournament and I
[SPEAKER_04]: literally Caught a ball took two steps and
jumped over a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like I mean, it's probably only
like six foot like I'm in 10th grade I
[SPEAKER_04]: literally just Vince Cartered over this
dude Like the referees were like alumni
[SPEAKER_04]: players players who just come back for
summer for money And literally they just
[SPEAKER_04]: take off running out of the gym The
referees are like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just jumped over somebody Like I was
really athletic but I think I'm uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I always liked weed it was never like
Besides when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the only time I didn't really smoke
but once I got into like high school and
[SPEAKER_04]: like college I Continued this I had two
scholarships and I was still smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hoop in your high?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I play better when I'm high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's slow It slows down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so fast as a musician that I don't
know sometime it might be I'm slowed down
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can shoot better right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little more aim a little like you
get normally time is going by about tick
[SPEAKER_07]: tick tick But when he smokes a weed you
get that tick tick tick and when you're
[SPEAKER_07]: playing music I'll take a hit of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's smoke some flowers when there's
flowers around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Joe But now I got to pass it
now you're back to the where this joint
[SPEAKER_07]: goes game But as a musician When you're
playing music, you could just feel the
[SPEAKER_07]: time so much better when you're a little
high It feels like that beat is so much
[SPEAKER_07]: thicker like you got so much more room to
play with that time It's coming by as a
[SPEAKER_07]: musician.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it Slops not in his head.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd like to rap when you're all high
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I probably smoke a blunt perverse
Perverse.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Snoop Dizzle It's just works
out that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I won't I'll put it out and do some
rap spark it back up and stuff It's not
[SPEAKER_08]: like the whole time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't the blunt doesn't fuck up your
throat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I Mean, I sound alright, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound good, buddy Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean yo, I was gonna say a second going
y'all were like I love we yo we we should
[SPEAKER_08]: all discuss like When we first smoked
weed, it's a hundredth episode like what
[SPEAKER_08]: brought us to this community, you know,
what was that first?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it sloppy when the first time
you smoked weed since you're putting us on
[SPEAKER_08]: this I'll go with this The first time I
ever smoked weed was walking home from
[SPEAKER_08]: school I was in fifth grade my school was
a fifth grade through 12th grade in one
[SPEAKER_08]: school because the community was small and
I didn't really know what the big kids
[SPEAKER_08]: were doing but they asked me if I wanted
to smoke and I said yes and I went to my
[SPEAKER_08]: friend Demetrius his house and we went to
his shed and played Sega Genesis and
[SPEAKER_08]: smoked blunts was grandma cooked us
chicken and I remember it was
[SPEAKER_08]: To be specific and it was the first time I
had ever seen or smelt them and I was
[SPEAKER_08]: horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're horrible We were playing golden
axe, it's one of the first games on Sega
[SPEAKER_08]: Genesis and we do it all the time and it
was funny because I was so young that I
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't know what I did was wrong until I
was about to leave when my mom pulled up
[SPEAKER_08]: and They're like, all right Don't eat
anything when you get home and go in your
[SPEAKER_08]: room and tell your mom you have a headache
And I was like, ah, this seems weird like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know But that was every day and
eventually my mom was like, why do you
[SPEAKER_08]: have so many headaches?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're laughing a lot Life is too good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoying yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you didn't even know that you were
doing something bad I mean my mom smoked
[SPEAKER_08]: cigarettes when I saw people smoking but
not I was just like I wanted to be a cool
[SPEAKER_08]: Kid it was fifth through 12th grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was there with all older kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a minority school I got integrated
into so it was just like, you know being
[SPEAKER_08]: the oddball out I was like, well,
that's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's write Yeah, and then I did it and
played those video games and I was like
[SPEAKER_08]: this is the shit and I have been playing
Video games go together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So damn well, so nice nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else want to tell about the
first time they got high?
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to if you don't want to Joe
I want here do it if you want to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty basic story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was interested in it Hanging out with
friends one day some people came with weed
[SPEAKER_05]: Got smoked and I was like, okay,
this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see why people enjoy this and Just
kind of have ever since how old were you
[SPEAKER_05]: if you don't mind me asking I guess 17
Okay, but that seems about an appropriate
[SPEAKER_05]: age to start smoking but it wasn't like
the first year it was really sporadic just
[SPEAKER_05]: like here and there It was it was just
like a curiosity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it got settled and then after that
then I became interested in like more than
[SPEAKER_05]: just weed as a cool after-school activity
So some other things took its place I
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but yeah, that's all that's all for
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all for that I can tell by the look
on your face not to go further with that
[SPEAKER_07]: question Miss Maddie Do you want to tell
us about the first time that you got to
[SPEAKER_07]: experience and play with the wonderful
world of ganja and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really really young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really say my story on a podcast
because I'm afraid that Might not go so
[SPEAKER_00]: well, but I was really young I was like 13
when I like started smoking weed like once
[SPEAKER_07]: or twice a week Yeah 11 Spencer just
pointed out that sloppy said fifth grade
[SPEAKER_07]: and Maddie's afraid to tell her story,
but okay I think I know why I think I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what yeah out of respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah word.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right So how old were you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like 13 when I saw I probably
started I probably smoked weed before that
[SPEAKER_00]: I started smoking cigarettes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in like a trailer park.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was kind of like I
started smoking and drinking really really
[SPEAKER_00]: young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when weed was introduced to me,
it wasn't even like a question I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just something normal started now
you hear yeah almost just like sloppy like
[SPEAKER_00]: just didn't really realize what I was
doing was wrong and that I remember one
[SPEAKER_00]: day I sat in a class because in North
Carolina you have to go through their
[SPEAKER_07]: classes, which is a Drug awareness class
drug abuse resistance education.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were talking about they were
talking about marijuana and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying how awful it was over there
marijuana Yeah, so I just remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like, oh shit, man, maybe that
stuff is bad, but it's good All right,
[SPEAKER_07]: Spence, you know, you're up next one's the
first time do you What do you remember
[SPEAKER_07]: about the first time you smoked some weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I smoked weed Like a spray bottle
and I was in like ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even didn't even know what getting
high was So I didn't know what I was
[SPEAKER_04]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, I guess it I guess I'm
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know and then I didn't really
touch weed until I was like Maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: sophomore the next year's when I was like
actually smoking it's not like every day
[SPEAKER_07]: but Two three times a week, I guess
Whenever someone's got some weed whenever
[SPEAKER_07]: it comes up Friday night or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my interest changed when There I
found out about good weed when I like
[SPEAKER_04]: first saw like Actually, like cuz
everybody remembers Reggie like he smoked
[SPEAKER_04]: Reggie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah start off with that shitty brick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, then you see good weed and it
completely like Changes your mind's like
[SPEAKER_04]: holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll never I'll never smoke that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weed is how you two started dating
Yeah, he had really really good weed and I
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a mutual friend and I was like in
North Carolina Where we lived at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: was really hard to find weed So I got some
from him and it was like super super good
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the best weed I'd ever seen like me
and my friend were freaking out like we
[SPEAKER_00]: start smoking and we were just giggling
No, it wasn't it was just like some really
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff or where we were at and we just
started hanging out after that But that
[SPEAKER_07]: weed puts you two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how cute if he had a had if he
probably had bad weed I don't know like
[SPEAKER_00]: probably would try to hang out with him,
but A good weed got you a good girl,
[SPEAKER_07]: bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Mike We're gonna shift over to
you bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: When's the first time you ever smoked some
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we thought we were smoking weed when
we were like 12 and 13 But now what I it
[SPEAKER_01]: was either the worst ditch weed ever or
more than likely It was just what some
[SPEAKER_01]: older kids had sold us as weed and was
actually mostly tobacco and like some
[SPEAKER_01]: oregano But the first time I got like
Really high a friend of mine after school
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was like 15 It's like hey,
you want to go smoke and I was like sure
[SPEAKER_01]: and I thought they meant cigarettes and we
got in her car and drove off and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like This is kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we're gonna go around the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to her garage and got stoned and
it was the first time I'd ever smoked good
[SPEAKER_01]: weed We called it red hair which really
which I think is yeah now that I know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I know About marijuana like we had no
fucking clue what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just happy to have weed that was
good And I was stoned out of my mind and
[SPEAKER_01]: by this point in my life I had sat through
dozens of hours of anti-drug education
[SPEAKER_01]: propaganda nonsense And so when I finally
got dropped off at my house I made it
[SPEAKER_01]: inside and flopped down in the guest
bedroom thinking that I was gonna die and
[SPEAKER_01]: That my mom was gonna be one of those sad
ass moms that goes to middle school.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like my son started smoking
marijuana Like ten years later after a
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible run of addiction So don't do
drugs kids, and then I woke up three hours
[SPEAKER_01]: later hungry shit But that's the first
time I got really good in stone I Got more
[SPEAKER_00]: high as you were telling that story
noticing that my edibles are working.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're definitely working 120 milligrams
deep and I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you've got your own little guy Mike
You got your own little kid, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do How old do would you prefer him to
wait?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's only he's pint-sized now you
guys this water bottle is taller than the
[SPEAKER_01]: Davie at least late teens late teens Okay,
just like let the brain finish developing
[SPEAKER_01]: like I wish I would have waited like
another couple of years, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, mainly for the lungs, but like if I
could go back and not do something it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be not tobacco Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: You smoke way too many cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do but Yeah, wait till 18 Let your brain
finish growing learn all this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to teach you in high school
Okay, so like how do you feel if he's like
[SPEAKER_07]: in like sophomore year junior year and
he's killing it with the grades He's doing
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing you know, we're all about
meeting your responsibilities Alright,
[SPEAKER_07]: so then as long as he's going to work at
village in on time or whatever He's doing
[SPEAKER_07]: and he's playing his guitar and doing his
guitar lessons like he's supposed to and
[SPEAKER_07]: his grades are good I'll still snatch it
away years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, you better make sure you smoking
good shit, too Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be smoking mid grade Mike's
house quality control, but He'd still get
[SPEAKER_01]: in trouble for it and shit until he was
out of my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, okay, I Wouldn't freak out if I
found out my teenager was getting stoned
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe looks like you got something to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just grabbed the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah I was I was gonna wait but uh
Yeah, you should explain yours first
[SPEAKER_06]: before I totally Oh the first time I
smoked ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was coming out the womb smoking a
joint Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a couple I had three uncles who were
pot-smoking assholes the whole time I was
[SPEAKER_07]: growing up So I grew up with I have an
uncle Eric.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out uncle Eric, bro You don't listen
to the show but shout out bro much love.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am kind of a clone of him I grew up to
become very much like him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hang out with him all the time my
uncles Ron try and Eric would hang out and
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke they had a bong that was the color
remember those old-school 70s bongs it
[SPEAKER_07]: looks like it's pistol grip in the front
it's got a Barb up here by your thumb the
[SPEAKER_07]: bowl comes out of the middle and it's got
like a dick mouthpiece that comes off of
[SPEAKER_07]: it and it's funky-shaped looks like it was
made in ceramics class They would sit in a
[SPEAKER_07]: room and just smoke out of that fucking
bong all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's that like weird shitty ceramic
shiny glass looking thing and they had to
[SPEAKER_07]: babysit me all the time and So hanging out
in that room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got stoned as fuck as a little kid,
but I didn't realize that's what was
[SPEAKER_07]: happening I was just like wow,
like I just knew something was weird and
[SPEAKER_07]: then They took me to a concert my uncle's
Eric And Ron took me to a concert I won't
[SPEAKER_07]: even see it say the name of the band
because it was some cheesy hair bands But
[SPEAKER_07]: it's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to go with my uncles and it was in
Long Beach in California So we were in an
[SPEAKER_07]: El Camino it's like a small truck and they
were in the front and I was in the back
[SPEAKER_07]: and they decided to smoke a joint on the
way and Play the black album from
[SPEAKER_07]: Metallica and that was a life-changing
drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what made me a drummer That's part
of what made me a pothead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got so stoned from the joint They smoked
all the smoke blew right in the back of
[SPEAKER_07]: the fucking Vehicle and I was just sitting
there just chief and they knew it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were laughing at me like I'm fucking
high bro, like official high, but I never
[SPEAKER_07]: hit the joint And they played that black
album from Metallica and by the time we
[SPEAKER_07]: got back I was already figuring out how I
was gonna go buy that album the next day I
[SPEAKER_07]: was like I'm a Metallica head and I want
to get high all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I love and so This is life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it that just changed some
shit and then shortly after that my friend
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris Ruth smoked me out and got me stupid
high and We're in the parking lot of my
[SPEAKER_07]: elementary school.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't in elementary school anymore at
this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was an adult by now smoked a joint or a
bowl with my buddy Chris Ruth probably
[SPEAKER_07]: probably How old was I I'm gonna say
seventh grade because I left California
[SPEAKER_07]: before ninth grade before tenth grade How
old was I it's about seventh grade when I
[SPEAKER_07]: first smoked weed with Chris Ruth then I
didn't smoke for a long time I didn't he
[SPEAKER_07]: would get me so high that I didn't like
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was too much Like he was trying if he
thought it was funny, but he would get me
[SPEAKER_07]: so fucking high that I didn't even enjoy
it So I came out here and then I met up
[SPEAKER_07]: with some friends and they were smoking a
bowl and I was like, oh man I remember
[SPEAKER_07]: that and I took a hit off of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get stupid hikes They're smoking
mids in Cali.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're smoking good weed not here They're
smoking shitty weed so I could smoke that
[SPEAKER_07]: so I got some training wheels and I
learned how to really smoke good weed And
[SPEAKER_07]: now I'm a fucking dad monster.
[SPEAKER_07]: I Want to take a fat dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really high, but I want to take a fat
dad because this is episode 100 you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a dab of some gorilla glue this
slab Is vanishing rapidly?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been dabbing the shit out of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was uh, who grew this We did we did
team weed and grew this team.
[SPEAKER_04]: We shout out a lot of stuff that I don't
really if anything, it's from us,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's Most like like 90% of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you guys brought some Sour diesel
live resin that is just some fire and I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't know what this live is you gave me
the other day But holy shit that was tasty

lemons Okay, that's why when I hit it it
[SPEAKER_07]: tastes like a damn mouthful of lemons What
you got over there man in death?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like life by lemons, there's no death to
it We should all exaggerate about how big
[SPEAKER_07]: this dab is.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is at least a gram, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding you guys I can't do a
gram dab and keep this show going.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already fucked up on edibles.

edibles dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel more like Lisa at at this point I'm
gonna take a dab somebody else say
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible how Joey corrupted Lee
Truly took this innocent boy and turned
[SPEAKER_05]: him into a real stoner and psychedelic
adventurer And that guy went from being
[SPEAKER_07]: afraid to smoke a joint to eating 500
milligrams of edibles every podcast that
[SPEAKER_07]: he's on now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm impressed He eats more edibles on

[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a racial thing You just don't
want to smoke that black slabbeth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's a little scary smoking some
janky hash Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the best way to handle that?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good thing We could talk about
here for the last couple of minutes on the

[SPEAKER_07]: Just say no, what's a good way to handle
that right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody was like Maddie, you all
right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trippin I just I just had this happens
all the time when people offer you stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just like you don't want to take
it at all and you have to politely Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: what's the way to do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the best way to handle that you
guys what is the most?
[SPEAKER_08]: You literally have to just educate them
for it I only smoke stuff that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: personally for sure where it's grown and
processed at I think it's rude to see
[SPEAKER_08]: somebody smoking something bad for Them
and not inform them like they may get
[SPEAKER_08]: like, you know Even if they get defensive
about it, like don't try to be
[SPEAKER_08]: confrontational with it But at least you
can feel good at the end of the day Like
[SPEAKER_08]: hey, I told that duty smoking something
that's gonna kill him Yeah because like if
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw somebody drop some rat poison in
some lasagna and then put it at the table
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely look at y'all and be like hey
So I just think it's wrong not to be like
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just Like hey, I'm I don't want to
like, you know offend you in any way,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I don't feel comfortable smoking that
and this is why because Kind of looks like
[SPEAKER_07]: boo-boo my friend Right before his dad is
up And that's what I that's would have
[SPEAKER_07]: been my solution Boo-boo, I'm like,
oh why don't you take a dab of this and
[SPEAKER_07]: just give that to them and then yeah Just
saying or nah and kind of a high-pitched
[SPEAKER_07]: voice is always acceptable as well You
guys get some good hash Don't don't don't
[SPEAKER_07]: settle for some crap.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some you guys just want to get high
cop a buzz Don't settle for some boo-boo
