[SPEAKER_00]: And you know I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends to find the Patreon page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'm going to do a quick episode
about making your own silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we do make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually in the middle of a work day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing work putting stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I need to mix up that
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should spray these plants today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought to myself, what kind of
podcaster would I be if I did not set up
[SPEAKER_00]: some cameras, throw up a microphone here
and get this episode recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to record myself making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to record myself making a silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be used to make the next batch
of fem seeds that come from irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the solution I am going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to watch me make my actual
solution, which I use for making feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things we should talk
about before we show you how to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I've talked about those
things many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given many other podcast episodes
about the precursors, the prerequisites to
[SPEAKER_00]: making your solution and to selecting your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly, I will say this selection is very
important when it comes to making
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized plants, you want true female
plants, if you're going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized plant, if you're going to
reverse a plant, pick a plant that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know is a true female, we want a plant
that has been tested, give it some light
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, give it feeding stress,
maybe not all at once or do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's see if that plant shows you
enter sex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not and will not make feminized
plants feminized seeds from any plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that ever show me any type of enter sex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's remove the word enter sex,
herm, hermaphrodite, especially eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: the word hermy from our vocabulary when it
comes to talking about femme seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: femme seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no hermaphroditism happening
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no hermaphroditic plants being
used if we're using silver in the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop saying herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use the right words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I would throw hermaphrodite away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can talk about a few of the options
when we're making femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are self plant plants, there are
reversed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to do, what I'm going to
do is I'm going to make a solution of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my chemistry nerd friend says I say
that incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think I say it wrong, politely do
correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I do apologize for the other rough
voice here, the raspy throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not prepared to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually in the middle of my
workday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not recording normal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is not prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been doing other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The voice wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be silver thiosulfate, thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's Theo, thio, either way,
it's going to do the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to mix up this solution and I'm
going to reverse one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to reverse three
different clones of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put that pollen on multiple
other females.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put that pollen on a cut of the
same plant, I'm going to reverse golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full disclosure, I'm going to reverse a
golden goat female, three golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put that pollen on another
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that will make golden goat S1,
self golden goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also put that pollen on a platinum
tangy plant and a lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will then make orange gasm and lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be other bitches in the room
that we can't talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get pollinated as well,
but let's stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other plants that get pollinated that
are not golden goat will be what are known
[SPEAKER_00]: as reversals, R1s and S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to self a plant, use its own
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to self that plant,
put it on other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done full episodes on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to give a little a little
background, a little prerequisite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about making this
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be working with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these chemicals here in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me move the iPad a little bit over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that mainly for the shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like things are going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird with the new mic placement and
the iPad in the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of my comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do the best we can with
this new setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a bottle of sodium thio or
thiosulfate, sodium thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show that to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will zoom in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that camera is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get the best angle for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you and we'll fix it in post is
what we're going to say here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this bottle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got this bottle of silver
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing that to this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hold it up here for a couple
of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let you take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show it to this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see which one gives us the better
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cameras are kind of far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll edit that to be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chemicals, I do buy them from a
company called United Nuclear on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: UnitedNuclear.com is how I think I find
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy the two ounces of sodium thiosulfate
and the 10 grams of silver nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is almost still full.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is almost empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another bottle inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it rattles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you the double seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very cheap products.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they could be caustic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a bunch of notices written on
the sides of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be very careful when you're
using these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll start off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to dab a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a safe person, if you're not
comfortable doing shit, blaze,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do this when you're high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get a clear head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe wait till after you do this to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe mix up your shit, then smoke in
celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not your boss, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: My rule of thumb, if I'm the boss is if I
can tell you're high, you're too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can't tell you're high, do your
fucking job and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That applies to you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't fuck this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't inhale these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ingest these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I'm going to do to be a
good example, to be a good leader,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put on my gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys ready for your exam?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, we're going to make some
solution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my gloves coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I hate it when the hands are all
clammy and the gloves won't go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the right size gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fit just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put on some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally when I'm doing this, I would wear
a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do things differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already poured the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already weighed them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them stored right here next to me
so that I don't have to waste time doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would normally wear a mask to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a mask and a podcast and a camera
and a microphone seemed stupid to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the mask seems silly to me at
this point, but this is not a political
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get the gloves and the mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also tie up the dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that I had them tied with the
big hat, it didn't work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do as I say and not as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyewear may be a good idea if you're a
clumsy fuck, but that's not necessary in
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a powdered chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, again, if you're a clumsy fuck,
get that eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get shit in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff says wear eye protection just
because legally I don't want to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear your eyewear, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear your gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear your mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type your dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type your hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type your loose sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got wobbly sleeves, now's the
time to get the wizard sleeve tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Type your dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also work in an area where if you spill
some shit, it's going to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got your iPad,
your recording equipment, your power
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure all that shit is scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that's all on the same table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing that for a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, do as I say,
not as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast area would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you got a lot of electronic shit
is what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I may recognize I recommend have
some paper towels or a rag or something
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some water pouring
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things could go awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep saying, I'm, I'm not a Jedi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also not a clumsy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm somewhere right in the middle of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do need a rag occasionally going to
have to clean some shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get down to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about mixing this solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I have in front of me?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the, uh, the two products,
the silver and the sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to scale because I'm going to
weigh these two products and a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a half a gram of one and two and a
half grams of another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to put those into 500
milliliters of distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a gallon jug of distilled water
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold that up for the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find the handle of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a gallon jug, just distilled water,
plain distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy, I try not to let it sit around too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a fresh one most of the time when
I'm making the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a gallon of distilled water
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've poured that into two 500 milliliter
measuring glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to slide these closer to
the camera view.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both filled with 500 milliliters
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold that up for the camera here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right up to the 500 mill mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a liter of water here,
essentially divided evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my two powders, the way I would
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I skipped a step because
of the camera, because of the mask,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of technology and to speed shit
up, probably talked right my way through
[SPEAKER_00]: speed and shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're going to do, we're going
to, I used a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I folded it in half to make it easier
to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you don't fold the paper,
it arches the other way and you lose your
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I simply took a piece of paper,
folded it in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set that piece of paper on the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I hit tear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my scale is at zero at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprinkled the product on there until I
reached the desired amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I was using the silver
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the recipe comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 500 milliliters of water and I
used one half of a gram of silver nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to just set the silver nitrate
right in front of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the silver nitrate container,
but I'm going to do it this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've weighed it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've weighed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle, sprinkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw me do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a half a gram right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to see the scale or do you
trust my weight, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tear to the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word I tore, I teared,
prefixed the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone will tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so right here, I do have half of a
gram of silver nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it'll come up on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to fucking fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dump that right into the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tap my paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get that all into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there is a, an imaginary trash can
right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've got some shit over there to
clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to put that over there
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use a very technical piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, um, we call a butter knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this because it's metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing sticks to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stir my shit gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost went too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want this to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should dissolve pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product was chunky, so it may take a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a couple of fat rocks in there
that need to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going, it's almost dissolved
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see by looking through the glass
here, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically dissolved in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part is taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set that there for a moment
and get myself a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm just going to fold it up nice and
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're just going to clean this
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part has been handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the first part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave that there just because it's
safe there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fucking anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the next step, excuse me for the
throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already did this disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to basically repeat the
process with the sodium thiosulfate for
[SPEAKER_00]: this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need 2.5 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to set that right in front of
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much of that's coming up
on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's far away for me to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did already pre-weigh it, but just for
science purposes and video purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll set it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, actually I'll take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will refresh the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's refreshing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just taking a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got shy on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set it on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypothetically, I would tear it right now,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit the tear button, uh, cause I put the
paper on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would sprinkle my product onto there
until it says 2.5 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it's 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can do now, pick up my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is container B, sprinkle it right
into container B.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one slid right off the paper real
well, just for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows me that is negative 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I started at the right point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that's the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fold this up, toss it into
the imaginary trash can, brush this off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably clean up a little
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing this at home, clean up a
little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave shit on your table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, especially if it's like the
family table where a pet, a friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: a child could be clean the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's another point that I kind of
maybe skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your shit before we start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, I cleaned this bottle, this bottle or
this cup measuring cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the measuring cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned my next jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned everything with, I cleaned it
real well with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it sit, water, let it sit,
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I cleaned it with alcohol,
let it sit and dry again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that about an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I set up the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned off my scale real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spray bottle is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: My environment is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be just as clean when I
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something important to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I should be stirring this
product into here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one won't take very long to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much, this one's a little
thicker than the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much starting to dissolve
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the cloud at the bottom is going
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we can remove the scale
from the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my paper towel here in case I
make a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got more trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just toss that to the other
hypothetical invisible trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep stirring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may fast forward part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once these dissolve, we're going to
simply combine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to see that the little
crystals at the bottom are disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a little bit left to stir,
maybe a little vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did spill it right up to the top here,
but I needed the 500 mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until you see me fit it into the one
liter jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it will get spilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to clean this off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need my little wiper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to go over here out of my
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make my OCD shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all the used shit that I don't need
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have mixed up our shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if you're doing this at your
space and you're not recording and have
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones on, get your dreadlocks tied
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your long hair out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, the mask may not be
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry powdered chemicals are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you want to think about your
eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always use the gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chemicals, I think they're slightly
caustic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could burn up your fingers,
burn up your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to risk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have got the two things mixed
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in science, you always pour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote this down because I always mix
this part up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always pour part A into part B when
you are mixing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part A.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think we should do normally,
honestly, what I normally do is I pour
[SPEAKER_00]: them in here together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to move the iPad over just a
little bit because I am a catastrophe once
[SPEAKER_00]: in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move the mic out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pour parts A and B in here
together kind of simultaneously at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that mixes them real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how they fit in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I've got that done,
I'll bring the mic back and we'll continue
[SPEAKER_00]: on with our normally scheduled program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to move those out of the way,
move the mic over and we'll get to action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the magic of editing, I did speed
that up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't have to watch me try to
slowly pour that in there and then dribble
[SPEAKER_00]: some onto the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it mostly fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got equal parts left over in both
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my ratios are still correct close
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that's going to be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit left in each
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to spill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste it, but they're
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just barely any left in each
container here, but this is as close to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to fit in here without
starting to spill it all over the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got our solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our one liter of silver
thiosulfate concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 100% dilution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot apply this directly to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will not be success if we apply this
directly to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we do need to dilute this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dilutions and application intervals
are where this becomes kind of an art,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same dilution rate and application
times and intervals are not going to work
[SPEAKER_00]: for every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just like working with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like taking somebody on a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't work for your last date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not work at all for your next date,
so you're going to have to figure this
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some success, but to get this
perfect, there will be some dialing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a little bit of a learning
process the way that I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get, and I said earlier, I was going to
spray three Golden Goat clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I'm going to spray them all
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spray these Golden Goat
clones because that is the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my spray bottle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a funnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the funnel with me,
so I've already failed myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a workaround to where we can
make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my spray bottle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do, I would spray this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have two or three spray bottles,
honestly, or I've got another method that
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to remain one of my secrets
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have three spray bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix up one solution that is 10%
silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put, how much does this one hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: 450.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say, just to make this easier,
we'll say that I've got a 1000 milliliter
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put 900 mils of distilled water
and 100 mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost track of my math.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 mils of this non-diluted silver
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is a nine to one solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine parts water, one part silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix up a nine to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nine parts of distilled water,
one part of our silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also do another one that is an
eight to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got eight parts water, two parts
silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would do another one that is seven
to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's seven parts water, three parts the
silver solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically 10, 20, and 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would spray each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the schedule and
intervals of when to spray these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my golden goat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I plan to do is I'm going to spray
them seven days before I put them into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm recording on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put those plants into flower
next Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will spray them today, give them a
full week, put them into flower next
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they go into flower that day I will
spray them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get sprayed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to spray them seven days
before and then we're going to spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: again on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where we've got to pay
attention because now I will spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: every three days until about day 21 or
around 25 or 26 depending on what I see
[SPEAKER_00]: from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are stubborn and they don't
want to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not reversing, keep spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I'm using three different dilution
rates so I can see some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But spray every third day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spray these plants about
seven to ten times total each plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you spray, spray that plant just
about to the runoff point right when it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts running off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak it to where it's just dripping
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful because the silver solution can
stain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make things have a like a purple
shine to it or a silver color behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have stuff on this table
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just spray the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the stems, the stalks, the leaves,
everything on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak it the entire plant and then it will
absorb more of the silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening here, brief science,
I'm not a Scientologist or a chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: major.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver disrupts the copper movement in
the plant which triggers this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as far as we need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver disrupts the copper movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get the silver into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sodium thiosulfate works to penetrate
the leaf surface and move that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we mix this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know more, I've done full
podcasts about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to stop myself from digging down
that rabbit hole because we could go deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about times to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where I was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody put me back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to spray one week before
flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we're talking about dilutions and
intervals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really kind of got lost, but we'll fix
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray one day then spray it every three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop around day 21 or 24, maybe 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it about seven to ten times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the heavier dilution will make
the plants crinkle up and look angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going for pretty plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going for pollen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also sometimes too much silver can
make the plants angry and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes not enough silver will make them
not produce any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes just enough pollen or just
enough silver but not sprayed enough times
[SPEAKER_00]: or sprayed too many times will make it not
make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many variables here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to learn how much and how often
with each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to really do it is to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I say spray three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do five, spray five of the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them with that 70, 80 and 90 and
then spray one of them more often than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other and less often than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set up your own variables and take a lot
of notes and see what works for the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned how to make the most amount
of pollen that I can get from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just all trial and error,
experience, experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's where my brain was
going with that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see twisted, crooked, bent leaves,
weird shit happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to start making
pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see these female plants
start doing shit you'd never seen them do
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right where the new flower clusters are
coming out at the top, you'll see these
[SPEAKER_00]: weird little round, it looks like they're
growing a crown or a tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a pine cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like some kind of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little baby corn or one of
those little star fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the fucking name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really cool looking fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts looking like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing out of the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the male parts forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around day 26, those will start opening by
day 32, 26-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that timeframe, they'll start making
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you need to have the ladies
ready or be ready to collect the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My strategy, I generally start putting the
females in the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spray these plants one
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spray them on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Monday, put them in flower 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around day 26, they'll start giving you
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plant specific, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really the part you got to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intervals, the timing, and the plants,
and the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all fucking timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the females in there when the male
plants start showing you or when the
[SPEAKER_00]: female pollen donor starts showing you
that it is making male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sure that that bitch is reversing
when you're positive that you've done the
[SPEAKER_00]: trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drag those girls into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should time it just about right at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've talked about before,
my platinum tangy plant that makes Sunkiss
[SPEAKER_00]: and Orangegasm, it wants pollen early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant that makes the strawberry
starburst, the strawberry fields I use,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wants pollen much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably, your first run,
figure it out by dragging them all in
[SPEAKER_00]: there the first time you see the male
parts really significantly forming on your
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your first cross that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then learn the timing from note-taking,
watching what happens, observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make adjustments on your next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always keep in mind, this isn't the last
time we're going to do this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless things go wrong, this isn't your
last run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time you're riding this
horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fall off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to get back up on that
horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some more femseeds and do that shit
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to review the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lost in one point, but I feel like I
covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that my point was talking
about dilutions and when to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn how often,
how hard to spray, just like learning
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody got to go how often and how hard
you don't know until you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drag the girls in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop spraying once you see pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't keep spraying the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the females in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let those guys pollinate the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're sure that they are done,
when the girls are close to their point
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're not going to receive any more
pollen and you're sure the guy plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen donors are done spitting out
their pollen, cut off the tops and just
[SPEAKER_00]: smack them around on the female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll knock out more pollen into the
room, into those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang the plants kind of from the lights
or from the top of the canopy as the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen donor dries, more pollen will fall
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get that last little bit of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get every drop that you can because femme
seeds, femme reversals don't make as much
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen as we would hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why all the caveats that
catches the tricks you heard are why femme
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning the intervals, learning the
timing, learning how much, learning the
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all takes trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all takes note taking skill,
repetition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do everything the same every
time and just adjust your solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why femme seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it doesn't make as much pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make about, when I do a five by five
space, I know how many seeds I expect from
[SPEAKER_00]: regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect about half, maybe three quarters
of that from a feminized run if I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why femmes are a little bit more
pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this SOP that I just gave you,
honestly, I charge a lot of money for this
[SPEAKER_00]: SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have charged a lot of money for this
SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many details I did not give you
that I'd included in the written standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was an expensive SOP in the past
and a standard operating procedure that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would charge money for in a consulting
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were, there are companies built on
this SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Eyrie Genetics uses this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the solution that I will use to
make more femme golden goat, more lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey, more orange, chernobyl to
reversed golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I said that out loud on the show that
is going to be in the, in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the solution I'll make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you how I'm going to get into
this bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm going to just dump this one
into here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set this aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a hundred percent mix right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the same thing that's in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm just going to dump it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go quickly because of the way
that physics and science and shit work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do with a mic in front of me
and see how much we spill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But booyah, go like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can dump this one into here easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do the dilutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my own ways of spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you guys, I'm excited to go spray some
golden goat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to pull them bitches out of the veg
area, getting rid of their safe space,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray them down, let them dry,
give them a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a week from now, we'll put them into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about 25, 30 days from there,
we'll drag the other girls into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about so many days from there,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon, Jeffrey, orange, gasm, golden goat,
red pill and blue pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminine seeds coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will also be Chernobyl to golden
goat testers available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're going to be excited about
that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of femme testers
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are interested in testing the
femmes, watch the femme or watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: tester episode number 590.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then join the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know, send me an email and let me
know that you've done all of the steps
[SPEAKER_00]: required to test and we'll get you tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to go spray those golden
goats, get some femme seeds going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've covered all the stuff I need
to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is feminized seeds simplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get this water into this
sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spray some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make some femmes,
ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: pamps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
growers, clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Femseed makers, all of you beautiful
cannabis enthusiasts out there.
