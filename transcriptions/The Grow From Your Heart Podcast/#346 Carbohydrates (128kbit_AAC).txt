[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 346 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross DeGette.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the
show is brought to you by my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, roll up a fat spliff,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some fresh water in the bong,
or start heating up that dab nail because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time for a fresh episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 346.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I am smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm taking dabs of the Copper Chem
Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Copper Chem is a combo of Chem 4 and
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's described as perfumy chem with
assorted fruit candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I smelled it, it smells
like chem dog to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells a lot like chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there is a hint of copper or
pennies inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you ran a batch of chem dog
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had the chem dog nectar and then you
just poured some copper pennies right into
[SPEAKER_00]: it is what this smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you dab it, it's got a tennis
ball fresh tire sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus that copper penny kind of stays on
your tongue at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high from this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my eyes bugging out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I should give a shout out to my
friends at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I picked up a new banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taking dabs of the Copper Chem
Nectar out of a brand new banger with the
[SPEAKER_00]: insert and I got smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took one of my, we call them turp pearls
or turp spinners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little glass bead basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took an eight millimeter glass bead and
I put that inside of my insert where my
[SPEAKER_00]: insert, the insert that drops into the
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put my dab in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I dropped the turp pearl,
the spinner on top of the dab inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I heat the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I dropped the insert inside the
banger with the dab and the turp spinner
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I carb cap it, give it a couple of
seconds for that dab to start melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I start drawing on it and moving the
carb cap around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that that turp pearls or
that turp spinner inside my insert dish
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped move that concentrate around
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I wiggled that carb cap,
I could watch the turp spinner move and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it would just push the puddle of oil
from one spot to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it really made my dab,
it didn't burn, it vaporized much more
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly at a nicer speed, at a nicer
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like none of it settled on the
bottom and started to singe there because
[SPEAKER_00]: that turp pearl was moving it around so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did an insert dab with the turp pearl
inside the insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not use the appropriate carb cap to
make the turp pearl spin, but I was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to move it around enough with my carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I have noticed, you guys,
just a change I've made in my dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my carb caps have a semi-large
opening for the air to flow through.
[SPEAKER_00]: My newest carb cap has a really small
opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really restrictive and I feel like
I'm getting better dabs with a more
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictive carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really satisfied with the thermal
banger, but I think I am kind of slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: making the switch to these insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more work, they take a
little more to prepare and a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean up, but you don't need as many of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I actually enjoy the ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of cannabis users,
pot smokers, we just enjoy the ritual of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting our stash and spending a moment
with your stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's grinding up a little bit of
weed to roll a joint, or maybe you're old
[SPEAKER_00]: school, maybe you're still picking the
seeds out of your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get your stash out, your little secret
stash, and you got your album cover or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is that you use to work on
your stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go through the little ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually enjoy the ritual of which dab
do I want to hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab a little container and I'm like,
ooh, the copper cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pick myself out a dab and which
rig am I going to hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do an insert dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a little dab in the insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, ooh, I'm going to put
a pearl in there and then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat up a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a really nice ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been enjoying the new rituals of
preparing the insert dab, then enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: the insert dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, there's the little bit
of cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pull the insert out,
then you got to clean up the insert,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you got to clean up the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully, you just repeat the
process and take a couple of more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But insert dabs have been a lot of fun for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been enjoying it, getting a
lot more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it is conserving my
concentrates a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm not burning that first initial
part of the dab off, as soon as it hits
[SPEAKER_00]: the banger, I feel like I'm getting more,
I'm getting to consume more of my dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm smoking on today,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of the copper cam nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting a Hitman hammerhead sidecar
rig with a quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loading the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drop it into an insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drop a turp spinner or a turp pearl
inside of the insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heat the banger, drop the insert into
the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I cap it with a bubble cap that is
also very restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give it a couple of seconds to start
melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I've been getting some of
the most satisfying dabs I've had in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the long version of what I am
smoking on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Tim Martin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also shout out to everybody at Elevate
Glass for taking such good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more quick thing I
want to talk about before I get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: main topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people listen to the podcast on
Stitcher Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher Radio is an application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using Stitcher, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not missing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your life is probably better for it
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to the show on
Stitcher and you are still experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in contact with Stitcher quite
frequently over the past couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are working to resolve the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not sure why my show is having
problems on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend, if you are a
Stitcher listener and you're having
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, I would recommend you just jump
over to YouTube and watch the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every episode is available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 1 through 346 is up on YouTube,
so you can watch everything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube does not compress my sound
quality, so it probably sounds better on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the loading issues that people are
experiencing will not happen on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: like they are on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been listening on Stitcher
and having issues, again, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you just to jump right over to
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not already subscribed to
the YouTube channel, I encourage everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: to go subscribe to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a lot of subscribers,
and I do appreciate that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like that's a
solid intro for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take one of these insert
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come back, I'm going to talk
about the function of carbohydrates in
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a big old dab of that copper chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go chill out on the couch for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go get some Instagram time in
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little bit more than I
bargained for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're smoking something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that if you're stuck at work,
if you're in a cubicle or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably high enough for both of us
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting in a chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not at work, so nobody can fire me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully when you get off work,
you've got a big fat joint rolled up at
[SPEAKER_00]: home so you can get as high as I am right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's turn down that music a little
bit and get into a podcast about
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start right off at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are carbohydrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should be more specific because
these are carbohydrates in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis plants, even more
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrates are compounds produced
during photosynthesis and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates have two main purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their first purpose is to provide building
blocks for plant structural components
[SPEAKER_00]: such as cellulose, which is important in
building cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second purpose of carbohydrates is to
deliver energy for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants make food in the form of
carbohydrates by combining carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: and water and using energy from either the
sun or our grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our plants can immediately use or they
can store the carbohydrates and those
[SPEAKER_00]: stored carbohydrates can be converted to
cellulose or other structural
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now excess carbs are stored in the plant's
roots and leaves and primarily are stored
[SPEAKER_00]: in the form of starches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants store those carbohydrates to
use during the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the daylight hours are reduced,
the plants aren't able to produce as many
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates because the lack of sunlight
or grow light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have it stored up for when that
time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most of the carbohydrate production in
our plants will happen during the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative phase and it will taper off
during the first three weeks of the bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically by the end of the third week,
the start of the fourth week of bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbohydrate production in cannabis
plants basically has stopped without our
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't step in and add something,
there will be no carbohydrate production
[SPEAKER_00]: through the rest of this plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when we step in and we add
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just because the plant stops producing
its own carbs around week three or four a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower doesn't mean you have to wait until
then to start supplementing the carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add them early on in the plant's
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could start them when the plants get
big, when they're in veg because the carbs
[SPEAKER_00]: do have another function that I'll talk
about a little later in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to wait until the plants
stop producing their own carbs to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we understand that carbohydrates are a
source of energy and also major building
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also understand that our plants
stop producing them on its own around the
[SPEAKER_00]: third or fourth week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's right when our plants really
start taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start seeing buds that happen that
stretches over and we're starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky buds right around that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when we need a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carbohydrate energy is used to
produce big buds, big robust stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of trichomes and then a lot of
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants running out of carbohydrates
right at that crucial time, that essential
[SPEAKER_00]: time is kind of detrimental to a cannabis
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most plants aren't designed or
expected to perform the way we expect our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the biggest, fattest, most potent
product we could possibly create in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shortest amount of time in the smallest
amount of space with the best resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to bugs and the best resistance to
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nature didn't intend for this plant to
become a rocket ship or a Formula One race
[SPEAKER_00]: car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature intended this plant to survive and
be good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature made this plant to where it would
grow and get an apical dominant top that
[SPEAKER_00]: would receive pollen more likely than the
lowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where it had that that huge shuttle,
hey, look, I'm right here, pollinate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made it to where the male plants
grow taller to where it would drop pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it knew if I do this, I should
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, he evolved to be a survival
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We manipulated it and bred it to be this
high performance plant that we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature never intended this from the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It evolved for tons of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any idea how long honestly,
but the plant evolved for thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: years by itself without humans touching
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to push it to do something it
was never expected to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we've done some breeding to
create genetics that were ideal for our
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done breeding to find the high
testing cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bred it to be a high performance
machine because we've realized that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now after realizing it's a
commodity, we want to push our plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the extreme and we expect them to
outperform themselves crop after crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hear a grower, what'd you pull
this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better get two and a quarter next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is that a lot of pressure on the
grower, that's a lot of pressure on that
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that plant can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got some of the older,
more finicky OG cushions, two pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, you should be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, I got two and a quarter,
you're Jesus of growing back in the day if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were doing that with some of the OG
plants and some of the equipment that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you were expected to do even
better on the next growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of expectations for
these plants and we've bred them to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet these expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've bred monsters,
we've got to feed them like monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to meet their expectations,
which is now more energy in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: more carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to keep our plants running strong after
their natural carbohydrate production has
[SPEAKER_00]: ended, we step in and we add our own
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen your plants slow down,
like right around week four, maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of week five of flower and you can't
figure out why, like your pH is on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got enough air flow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VPD is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe those plants were lacking
carbohydrate energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they just slowed down just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have gone a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen them go faster before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just ran out of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consider your physical performance
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just think about what you do,
your physical performance level on a daily
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider your nutritional intake and what
it takes for your body to perform the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to eat to keep your body
in shape to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many calories do you have to consume
to have the energy to perform your daily
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're performing at your normal
natural level, your expected level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say if I expected you to
increase your performance by 30%,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to work 30% harder,
30% longer, and I need a production of a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum of 30% more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think I'd probably have to increase
your feed and your pay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm gonna have to increase your pay
also, but I'm gonna have to increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: feed by a minimum of 30% to try to get 30%
more production out of you, or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep that in mind with your cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same sort of thing with your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start introducing things like
high-end nutrients, double-ended Gavita
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs, CO2, supplemental LED lighting,
and then we start implementing things like
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning the bottoms off, and then we do
things like cracking the stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're expecting a lot from our plants,
and we need to provide those plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper nutrition to see the results
which we demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now that we understand what
carbohydrates are and what they do in our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and why we need them and why we
need to add them ourselves, let's talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about how we can add the
carbohydrates ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to fully feed a carbohydrate
product to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go spraying carbs onto your plants,
you're just gonna clog shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a gross mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to feed carbohydrates is to
add a carbohydrate product to your water
[SPEAKER_00]: and your nutrient solution, just like any
other bottle nutrient, and water it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbs are best absorbed through the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now right away, a lot of people are gonna
tell you to add molasses to your feed
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to increase your carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used molasses in the past,
but I wouldn't recommend just store-bought
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe back in the day I have said to do
that, but I wouldn't do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Store-bought molasses is really
unreliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very inconsistent, not only from
brand to brand, from region to region,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you could buy the same brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy two bottles and you could
pour that molasses into two bowls and
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be two different consistencies,
two different colors, two different
[SPEAKER_00]: smells, and we like a little bit of
regulation in cannabis growth so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we are feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if we see a problem, we know it
was that and maybe not maybe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say it could have been the
molasses, so stick with a horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You organic guys that like to go all
organic, you're gonna probably just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the molasses is a little
bit too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also invites other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of suffocate your roots with
too much molasses in your feed solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it also, molasses contains other
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of molasses will contain sulfur,
and like I said earlier, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: add random feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To our plants, we're only trying to add
carbohydrates, not sulfur, so the molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna disrupt your feed program,
throw off your plant's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be hard to monitor because you
don't know what's in that molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a myriad of things messing up
your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using any hydro, definitely
stay away from the thick molasses-y type,
[SPEAKER_00]: syrupy kind of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really just gonna clog up your
entire hydro system, so be very careful
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you overuse the molasses,
you can't flush it out, and your buds will
[SPEAKER_00]: burn like shit in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll admit it, a long time ago,
I wasn't always a really good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to be a shitty grower to become a
good grower, and a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't always read the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do the proper research,
but I did have a grower friend that I
[SPEAKER_00]: trusted, and he said, bro, just pour this
much molasses into your five gallon thing
[SPEAKER_00]: of fucking nutrient solution, mix it up,
get all that molasses mixed in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then water the plants with it,
and it will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I way overdid the molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, because when I smoked those
plants, they burned like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like smoking a charcoal briquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd put it in the grinder, and you'd
grind it up, and the grinder would like
[SPEAKER_00]: skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like, kick, kick, kick,
kick, kick, kick, because the buds were so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard, and that was, I'm certain it was
from the molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they burned, it just all stayed
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no white ash crew in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was black charcoal ash, and it was
from way too much molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend not using molasses,
but if you're going to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: use it sparingly, and if you're an organic
grower, that's probably going to be your
[SPEAKER_00]: first option for a carbohydrate sweetener
type of project product is the molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just read a little bit and see if there
are any other options that will satisfy
[SPEAKER_00]: you for your organic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand if you want to go completely
organic, and molasses is your thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't let me stop you, make yourself
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you my two cents,
and if you want to take it, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow your way, I encourage
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite things about
cannabis is that my grow is totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different than your grow, and they both
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both put a product on the table at the
end of the day that is a top shelf product
[SPEAKER_00]: that people enjoy, and it works for our
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the beauty of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just my input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I said I wouldn't use molasses,
and I try not to pitch products too much
[SPEAKER_00]: on my show, but here are three products
that I am familiar with that I have used
[SPEAKER_00]: that have worked great for carbohydrates
in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, one of the best crops I
ever grew, I used a product called Humble
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble Honey has yucca extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble Honey has a lot of great things in
it, and it really made my product taste
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble Honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have regular Humble Honey,
and they have a Humble Honey hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: blend, which is a little thinner,
so you're not going to mess up all your
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Humble Honey is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I like Hybricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybricks is from a company called Earth
Juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way Hybricks smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I really do enjoy is
called Sucanat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugarcane Natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: S-U-C-C-A-N-A-T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucanat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that one from our friend Subcool
probably 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are three products that you can
use for carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't get paid by a carbohydrate
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things I've got experience with
that worked for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Hybricks because it's very
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a lot of additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the Humble Honey because of the
additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that yucca extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it did a little something for
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sucanat, that's old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using that a way long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of those products will be a
little molasses-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And earlier in the show, I said don't buy
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why am I recommending molasses-based
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this stuff has been filtered,
and it's a little more consistent than the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being sold for a horticultural
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to meet a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food can have a little variation because
it can taste different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can look a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a horticultural product, they put a
little different standard to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't assure you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the consistencies are a little better
to work with when you're buying them as a
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Botanicare Blackstrap molasses is
really thick and a pain in the ass to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're thinking you're
going to do, I'm not going to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is a pain in the ass to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a big old container of just,
it looks like tar, and it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, I went through
several containers of it, and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying about don't buy
molasses from the store, like the grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go buy Granny's Blackstrap molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to a grow store and get a horticultural
product that is more homogenized,
[SPEAKER_00]: more regulated, and more uniform,
and more consistent so that that way you
[SPEAKER_00]: can dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually the opposite of what I
would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, I would say if you can find that
product and not at a grow store,
[SPEAKER_00]: go get it, not at a grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this one occasion, I'm going to
recommend that you get an actual growing
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just did a quick Google search just
so I could do some price checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny because I ended up on a
forum, and everybody says that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackstrap molasses is a pain in the ass
because they end up wasting half of it
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the stupid container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said before I even went for
the Google search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what comes up when I look for hybrids
and when I look for humble honey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybrids is mostly molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit diluted so that it works
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't say that they add anything to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just say that it's been thinned to
where it works for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humble honey has additives,
and it is quite pricey compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a little money to spend,
I would say throw it at the humble honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to go low budget,
I think that hybrids would make you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants just as happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said earlier, if you're trying
to go all organic, I think the hybrids may
[SPEAKER_00]: qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is listed as organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to stick with just
molasses, that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind, they do add things or
there could be things in the molasses that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do choose to use either the
blackstrap molasses from the store or the
[SPEAKER_00]: botanic hair kind, stir it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it gets diluted or dissolved or
whatever, because it's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really thick and it's going to take a long
time, a lot of stirring to break that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another reason just to work
toward either some humble honey or the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your life a lot easier and
you'll find yourself spending less time
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up sticky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm using the hybrids right now
because I stopped at a local grow store
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did not carry humble honey and
the hybrids was quite affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the product I chose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been using the hybrids off and on
for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend Donovan from way
back in the day who introduced me to earth
[SPEAKER_00]: juice nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys earlier I mentioned
that carbohydrates had an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit to our grow that they would be
useful from early on in our veg stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way through the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that added benefit
that I hinted about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another added benefit of carbohydrates is
that they will feed your microbes in your
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that recharge or that mammoth pea or
that great white shark that you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: pouring in there, it needs to be fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that beneficial fungus is hungry and
it will use these carbohydrates as food
[SPEAKER_00]: and fuel to keep living and reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your carbs are working double time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving your plants extra energy
and they're also feeding your microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are keeping the roots healthy,
keeping the roots happy, which are also
[SPEAKER_00]: helping the plants absorb more
carbohydrates, which are making the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how it all works?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in symbiosis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get everything dialed in,
everything works together so well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my podcast on
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I taught you something today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to hear your input on me
talking about not using molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people are going to have
stuff to say about that.
