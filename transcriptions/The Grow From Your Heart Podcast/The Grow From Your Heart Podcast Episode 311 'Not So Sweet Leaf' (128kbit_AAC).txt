[SPEAKER_00]: All right, enough advertising for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these podcasts off by
letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been dabbing on some Stardog
Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in love with the Stardog lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way it smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the high it gives me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like taking pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog has just been, it's been a great
plant for me lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a smell right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that fuely, earthy thing that
I've been into lately and then it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: something else on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something just dirty and funky and I
really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuely, dirty, feet, funk, right up my
alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the exact thing I've been in love
with lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been so in love with the Stardog
lately that I crossed it to a rise and I
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to struggle for a name
for it and I was in an Instagram live feed
[SPEAKER_00]: the other day and one of our friends who
I'm not sure if he wants his name set on a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, but he shouted out or he typed
out, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: He typed out Starstruck and I'm going with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starstruck is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog to a rise, that is called
Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming soon to a seed bank near you,
Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got Starstruck named.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got blueberry cookies crosses available
and I am smoking Stardog Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've covered all the business for
the start of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay attention to the podcast,
you have probably heard me talk about a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary known as Sweetleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf is a chain of dispensaries in
Colorado that got in trouble for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something known as looping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we get too far, I'll tell you
what looping is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the state of Colorado, when you buy
recreational cannabis, you are allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one ounce at a time per transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people found that word per
transaction as a loophole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would buy an ounce of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would then drive around the block or
maybe just go get lunch or something and
[SPEAKER_00]: then come right back to the same
dispensary and buy another ounce of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which means they have now
purchased two ounces of cannabis from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same dispensary in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at some point, the marijuana
enforcement division sent out a memo
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, no more looping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule is that you are allowed to sell
one ounce of cannabis per person per day
[SPEAKER_00]: from your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, it was expected that
looping would stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears allegedly that Sweetleaf
continued with the looping and that puts
[SPEAKER_00]: us kind of in the article that I've got
before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from The Cannabis and
it was written by Alicia Wallace and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was originally published on April 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was updated yesterday and it goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sweetleaf dispensary chain shut down
in December after a police sting was a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal enterprise that pocketed millions
from an illicit looping scheme that
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed customers to purchase the maximum
amount of marijuana multiple times in a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, a municipal hearing officer has
ruled.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, Sweetleaf Marijuana Centers
could be stripped of its 26 retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and manufacturing licenses
according to recommendations released
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday by Denver hearing officer,
Suzanne Fazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf scheme, at the very least,
permitted the unlawful possession by its
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and its scheme was not the
action of a reasonable licensee,
[SPEAKER_00]: she wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did Sweetleaf fail to take action
to stop the illegal purchases,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it actively aided and abetted the
illegal purchases through its looping
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashley Kilroy, the city's director of
marijuana policy, will have the final say
[SPEAKER_00]: on Sweetleaf's fate following a 10 day
period for objections and a five day
[SPEAKER_00]: period for a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilroy's determination could come in the
next few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials for the city of Denver said
Sweetleaf could not be immediately reached
[SPEAKER_00]: for comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf's licenses were suspended on
December 14th when police raided eight
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf facilities in Denver and Aurora
following a year long undercover
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation into illegal marijuana
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than a dozen arrests of budtenders
and customers have been made in connection
[SPEAKER_00]: with the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investigation zeroed in on alleged
incidents of looping in which Sweetleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: budtenders would make repeated sales of up
to one ounce of recreational marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum allowed for individual
possession under Colorado law to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: customer multiple times in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looping accounted for at least $6.7
million of medical marijuana sales in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 month period that ended when the stores
were shut down and at least $1.5 million
[SPEAKER_00]: in recreational marijuana sales,
according to the hearing officer's report.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least half of the loopers had out of
state IDs, Fazing wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: She found that people from Arkansas,
Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: large amounts of marijuana to resale
illegally in their home states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those customers were convicted of
criminal charges after being arrested with
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple pounds of Sweetleaf marijuana in
their possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure a lot of people are gonna go,
how can they prove that that was Sweetleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because when you buy something from
a dispensary, it comes very nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: packaged, but then they put a sticker on
it with their logo right on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at a couple of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Apothecary Farms logos all over
my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Three Rivers logo right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole, I've got a Cut Above
logos right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could tell where all of my products
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you couldn't tell by the logo on
it, there's a number on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of these packages, let's see if
I can find it on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually got the dispensary,
the address, the city, the zip code,
[SPEAKER_00]: the phone number, followed by the MMC
number, the medical marijuana center,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 402- number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number right there indicates exactly
where that came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, that's how they know where it
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what day that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what day that was purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of those stickers are on there,
all of the details are right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people out of state,
they want that labeling on there because
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes the product worth more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got labels on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking those labels with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they know that it was Sweetleaf
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Facing her testimony in Sweetleaf's case
over several days in March and April,
[SPEAKER_00]: essential, a central issue raised then was
what constituted a transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's marijuana rules were amended on
January 1st to define a single transaction
[SPEAKER_00]: as including multiple transfers to the
same consumer during the same business day
[SPEAKER_00]: where the retail marijuana store employee
knows or reasonably should know that such
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer would result in that consumer
possessing more than one ounce of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf's attorneys argued that Colorado
marijuana rules in place prior to January
[SPEAKER_00]: 1st did not explicitly prohibit the sale
of more than one ounce of recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana per day, but rather it barred
any single sale of more than one ounce of
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple transaction to the same person
would not have been in violation of state
[SPEAKER_00]: law, they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facing disagreed, citing a marijuana
enforcement division public notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: outlined how sales that are structured as
multiple standalone transactions may be
[SPEAKER_00]: viewed as an attempt to evade quantity
limitations on the sale of recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf's owners, Matthew Aiken,
Christian Johnson, and Anthony Suaro
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged and directed the practice of
looping, including training new employees
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow looping for retail customers if
the customer left the premise after each
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase, she wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence cited by Facing included messages
from management on Sweetleaf's Slack
[SPEAKER_00]: channel promoting multiple sales to the
same customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looping is going to be going on until the
new year most likely, they wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence is clear in this case that
respondents implemented a looping scheme
[SPEAKER_00]: that was intended to evade quantity
limitations on the sale of retail
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like there's a huge chance
that Sweetleaf will lose all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses, and if that happens,
there will be a lot of hot licenses up for
[SPEAKER_00]: sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna see some changes in the game
when that comes, but it looks like a lady
[SPEAKER_00]: by the name of Ashley Kilroy has the final
say on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they get a 10 day period for
objections and then a five day period for
[SPEAKER_00]: a response, and it looks like they say the
determination could come in the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I will do my best to keep
everybody updated, and I wanna give Mike a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge shout out for sharing this article
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thanks for the great text
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made a great podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, it just started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in Colorado, if you live in
southern Colorado, you know about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Miller moth season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year in southern Colorado,
we get invaded by these little moths that
[SPEAKER_00]: fly around all of your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one just arrived in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just flew around the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly around all the lights all the
time, and when they bump into the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that moth dust, that butterfly dust
comes off their wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta just keep shit covered up,
and honestly, I start turning off more
[SPEAKER_00]: light, so it helps me remember to turn off
all the damn lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta cover up all the hash on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have any concentrates open,
because I don't want that moth dust in my
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst part is when they get in the
damn grow room, because they just wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: fly around your light and all on the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smack the, if you got glass over the
light, like I've got vented lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: they bounce all over that, and if you
don't have glass over the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: they fly into the fucking bulb and cook
themselves, and it smells so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they're annoying more than
anything, but they have arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Miller season.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I wanna give a few
shout-outs before I start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give a huge shout-out to my
