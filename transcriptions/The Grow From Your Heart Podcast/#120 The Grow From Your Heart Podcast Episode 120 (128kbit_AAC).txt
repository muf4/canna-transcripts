[SPEAKER_03]: We had Mike over, and our good homie
Sloppy was back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did an episode about how to interact
with law enforcement in case you're pulled
[SPEAKER_03]: over or in case you bump into the cops out
in public or in case the cops come to your
[SPEAKER_03]: front door.
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be some useful advice in this
one for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to the podcast, I need to
give a huge shout out to my friends at

[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into the episode about
how to interact with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think we have learned today is that
we need to sign an emergency contact form
[SPEAKER_03]: for people when they come over and take
dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to fuck people up over here,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting to my left is our good friend,
Buzzy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing today, my friend?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, y'all as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here, kind of in front of me a little
bit, off to an angle is our good buddy,
[SPEAKER_03]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here, even more in front of me is our
buddy, Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get to see you often enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I shot over here like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, Sloppy was on time, if not early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was fucking impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a topic that we're going to talk
about tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tell a little quick story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, I was at work and one of my
tremors, I will not say his name just
[SPEAKER_03]: because I got respect for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my tremors called me and he's like,
hey, bro, can you do me a favor?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, anything for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, can you come pick me up at
the fire station?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I got pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they gave me a DUI for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they pulled him over.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had probable cause to pull him over.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they pulled him, walked up to the
car, the car reeked of cannabis because
[SPEAKER_03]: he's a tremor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occupational hazard, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cop was like, holy shit,
you smell like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy was like, well, I'm a tremor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, all right, well,
get out of the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give you a sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy failed the test.
[SPEAKER_03]: They then put him in the cop car and took
him to the fire station and drew blood.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, they called me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy called me and said that I could
come pick him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of minutes later in my phone
ringing, it was my buddy saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, this state trooper just said that if
you look, smell, or act high at all,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's going to arrest you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be cool if you're coming or I'll call
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't smoked since, yeah, it was early.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like two in the afternoon and I
don't even think I smoked before I went to
[SPEAKER_03]: work that day because I go too fucking
early to smoke sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hadn't smoked all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason my eyes would be crispy is
because I'd been up for too long working
[SPEAKER_03]: in the fucking grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I drive over there and I call my buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, can you come out?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, hold on, the cop's going to
come talk to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh fuck, he's going to
come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got my couple of friends in the car
from work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just brought everybody with me because I
didn't want to leave them there without
[SPEAKER_03]: the boss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put them in the car like a field trip
for the boys and took them to the fire
[SPEAKER_03]: station.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get out of the car, I was like,
you guys stay here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody recorded this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of the people recorded the
interaction on their cell phone just in
[SPEAKER_03]: case shit went sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing went wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I walk up to the cop and he's like,
so your buddy was pulled over for DUI.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's too intoxicated to drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the opportunity to either take
him to jail and keep him or I can release
[SPEAKER_03]: him to a responsible adult who will
declare responsibility for him for the
[SPEAKER_03]: next eight hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know the guy, he's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going to come work with,
I need him to fucking come work with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on his way to work when he got
pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, yeah, man, I'll sign the
paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cop's like, I need your ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he took my ID and watched me write
down my information as I was doing it and
[SPEAKER_03]: ran my license and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, you're not wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never felt more unwanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, I was sober.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of, the cop, I want to
give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really fucking cool for being a
state trooper that had to give my friend a
[SPEAKER_03]: DUI.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave us information on how to avoid
getting ourselves in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said stuff like, don't smell like
cannabis so strongly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't smell like cannabis, have expired
plates and do these certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said there are 15, he didn't tell us
what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said there are 15 things that they look
for as main keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy hit nine of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he definitely got arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they let him go to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cop was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been talking about doing this
episode about what to do if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: involved with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like my buddy handled himself well.
[SPEAKER_03]: He told them he worked in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to over, you wouldn't have gotten
that call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was peaceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have gotten a very different
call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you come out of the car like,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you arresting me?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to get, yeah,
you're going to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your car.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even tow his car.
[SPEAKER_03]: They pull it off to the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they were extra decent about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they asked us a lot of questions and
I'd quit when I was picking him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cop asked basic questions and then he
got friendly with us and started asking
[SPEAKER_03]: questions about the industry and work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at one point I just shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, I don't want to answer any
more questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tricked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's my friend now and I'm telling him
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, wait, no, shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause and don't say anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to pull myself out of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it brings us to this episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really good way to segue into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys don't drive high because they're
out looking for people in Colorado right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: This officer told us it's the start of
their searching for DUI season.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the state troopers have recently taken
a drug expert class.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the state troopers are now
cannabis intoxication or impairment
[SPEAKER_03]: experts or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where they could tell how high you
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this cop said things that made me
think he was serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew stuff about my buddy being
intoxicated that I know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, your buddy doesn't look high or
act high, but when I interviewed him,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell there are things inside of him
that are going on that indicate that he's
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was impressed by the way they put it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about some things that we
could do to maybe help ourselves out and
[SPEAKER_03]: not get in as much trouble and maybe
prevent ourselves, maybe hopefully walk
[SPEAKER_03]: away without any fucking handcuffs,
or maybe instead of getting all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: taken to the jail, keep yourself in a
situation where they call Ross to Jeff and
[SPEAKER_03]: he gets to come pick you up and sign for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about like if you get pulled
over, your method, our friend Buzzy over
[SPEAKER_03]: here, he's told me his method of how to
handle himself when he gets pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go around the table and
I'll start with Buzzy because he's to the
[SPEAKER_03]: left.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're driving down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you got a little weed in the car,
but it's hidden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not all of our listeners are in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of these people are going to be
like however many percent of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you are is really going to depend on
what you should do before you get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you are driving with weed,
regardless of where you are, you should
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much put it in the trunk always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in no way endorsing breaking the
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to teach you how to be a
little smarter about getting to a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in Colorado where it's all gravy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll stick with Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Colorado out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you light up a big blunt, let me find
you an ashtray, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, just do it right here onto this
table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ass into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do that then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a MacGyver, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: MacGyver, MacDaver, MacBlunt, MacBlunt,
MacGyver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you invented ashing into the
Swisher package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before instead of deciding I
want to just ass on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's order in the court.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tapping the gavel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got my buddy Buzzy over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got those red and blues behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're flickering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bling, bling, bling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're getting pulled over for who the
fuck knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the cops, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not using your blinker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being in a car and driving and just being
a person.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Windows are tinted.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what color you are in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have no idea what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even know yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cop walks up to the window, shines his
light right in your goddamn face.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually he'll say something like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would have the window rolled down
before he gets there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hands should be on the steering
wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both hands on the steering wheel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be able, the cops should be
able to see both your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is to, my method is avoid anything
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be extremely what the cop wants to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him the most desirable situation
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be submissive to him almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm just trying to avoid paying
money to the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or getting shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far his method and my method are very,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just keep your hands on the wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like license registration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it's in my glove box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I reach into it?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go into it, you get your stuff out,
give it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different things can happen from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so he grabs your license.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, I'm pretty good, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably is what you're polite,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gonna be like license
registration, proof of insurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to walk back to the car and
hopefully he's going to come back and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to say, uh, my friend Buzzy,
you were going a little too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, quit driving like an asshole in these
parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to give you a warning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, hopefully it goes well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the key to it, I think we're all going
to have the same story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, be polite to the cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to be, know your rights,
but don't try to invoke them immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the cop comes up, give him what he
wants until he started, until they start
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the important thing to keep in mind
here is that they have all the power and
[SPEAKER_01]: can execute you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean not to fucking blunt it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine, 99 times out of a hundred or
probably even more than that, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get annoyed, ticketed and sent on your
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one time out of however many
they're going to freak out and shoot you
[SPEAKER_01]: in the face or get pissed and drag you to
jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the cops will just straight rob
you and take your shit and leave you
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your shit and leave you on the side
of the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the same pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, like exercise your rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you follow the little script
they're expecting nine times out of 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're on your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10, 15 minutes as long as it takes them to
run your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the same pullover.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've gotten pulled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've gone through all the shit our buddy
Buzzy over here has handled.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now when the cop comes back with your
license, registration, proof of insurance,
[SPEAKER_03]: he goes, Hey Mike, uh, kind of smells like
you got weed in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what's the proper response at this
point?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't consent to any searches,
sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sloppy do not endorse that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not ever endorse running from the
law enforcement unless it's in a video
[SPEAKER_03]: game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so just, I do not consent to any
searches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just, you keep repeating that when
they ask you to search your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need major probable cause and they'll
make shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you've got Altoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probable cause because trunks use
that to cover their breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not probable cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about like myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: I work in a giant grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trimming plants that were six feet
tall today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to chop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to lean in between two plants and
chop plants down and carry six foot tall
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my shirt, I probably reek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got trim on me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was coming from work and they said,
you smell like marijuana, I work in the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a side effect of my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably probable cause to search
my vehicle though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, be, be, I'm sorry to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say be strong on distinguishing
the different smells between smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and fresh marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this doesn't, this, this smell that
you're smelling is work related.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the smell of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, you're, like they're
arguing about smells because you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: slurring your speech because your eyes
aren't red because they didn't catch you
[SPEAKER_01]: weaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't do that shit is probably one of
the things we should put on the list to
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid getting your ass in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're sober right now, you can argue
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a smell that I picked up at work,
working while sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on my way home sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what you're smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you insist on searching the car,
like unless they're finding roaches in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ashtray or a dab rig in a cup holder and
put your shit away, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're headed on the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have it out of reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, have your stuff in a, in a,
if you've got a locked container,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they'd prefer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we were talking about that
earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It works just like booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a 12 pack in the back,
back seat of the trunk, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that 12 pack is open and the 12th one
is in your cup holder, half drunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you ain't fine no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You little blunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never passed it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with you, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hit it four times, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I figured there's only two of us
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a puff on that blunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to turn down your blunt at
the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect the blunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, and I grew this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's part of why I want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I was sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I used to pass to some of my
friends just not wanting to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just see her face sales all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made me this stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did this to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the red and blue lights behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just cruising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't done nothing wrong that you know of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pull over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come up behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you handle yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two different answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I was younger, cause I have two
totally different perspectives on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I got you here from being an
adolescent to being in a, or, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like from going from young to old,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was just saying, I'm just tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember why I don't smoke blunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, is that a respect for the blunt and
my homie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could die happy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, uh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was younger, uh, I was one of
those old, Oh, fuck the police,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't do shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would, you know, approach the
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pull me over and I'd be like,
why'd you pull me over this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd be really confrontational
towards it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what would happen because I was
being confrontational in a scenario where
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays you comply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking comply to everything they are,
are asking you within reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, Oh, why, why were you speeding
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, keep like what Buzzy said,
keep your hands where they can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to make the police officer feel
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, as soon as they walk up to the
window, that should be your best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh, those teeth are mighty white
today, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking real sharp in that clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's nice and sunny out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, don't say the phrase mighty
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without, without putting myself out
there too much, I was driving,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, not high at the moment, uh,
going 15 over and I had weed on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back in North Carolina or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I got pulled over and I had
Colorado plates cause I had a rental car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going, I'm going 15 over, uh,
and I just, I was like, fuck, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like dude got out of the car with his
cowboy hat, like he had a cowboy hat and
[SPEAKER_00]: his badge was on the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so what happened was I drove back
to North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought a little bit of personal cause I
didn't want to deal with no like fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: ratchet shit to get weed back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got pulled over in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst place to get pulled over ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got out with the badge on his hat
and I was like, Oh, he's going to shoot me
[SPEAKER_00]: and my dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had two little puppies, but so I'm
nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fuck, fuck, fuck Colorado
plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right until he was in my peripherals,
I was nervous, like scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as he was at, I sung to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, I could have sung him a whole
disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so nice to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he asked me why I was speeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, officer, I've been driving for
like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that there's a rest area up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honestly just trying to make it
there so I can go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Runs my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know how the police things
work, but I'm pretty sure that when they
[SPEAKER_00]: run my name in any state, they can see my
criminal background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it goes from state to
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he saw that I haven't perfect,
but the bigger stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he saw I had a record,
uh, and he treated me totally
[SPEAKER_00]: respectfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I pulled you over, accused you
were speeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to, to really come talk to
you because of your Colorado plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see if you have anything to
hide from me, but obviously you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he left me, didn't even give me
the speeding ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all because I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made him feel comfortable and I was
polite because 15 over, they could take
[SPEAKER_00]: your license on the spot if they really
want to be a Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were in Kansas and I had two pit
bulls in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after he left, I threw up because I
was like, Oh my God, I really thought I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going back to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I hate life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take my dogs,
but I could have handled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I was younger and been an
asshole and got my dog shot and got
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking taser killed myself or thrown back
in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate seeing all these videos where
they're like, Oh, that's, that's police
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's police abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dude isn't doing what the police
is asking him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like lay down on the ground, lay the fuck
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, why do you want to get DDT?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just don't see the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're pointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I saw a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all video.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police had a gun pointed at a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a knife pointed at a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a knife and he lunged at them and
they shot him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were like, unnecessary force.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fucking hypocrite because if you
have a legal gun on you and I come and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to stab you right now, you're going to
shoot me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You faggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't fucking, don't be dating on the
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and when I say faggot,
I don't mean gay people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be all uptight about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a little fucking bitch about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a little faggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, because if I try to stab you,
you're going to shoot me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I hate that because people are so
hypocritical because if they put
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in the same position,
they would act totally different than what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate that because if you try to stab
me, I'm shooting you if I have a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: firearm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand in front of that guy with the knife
and I'll give you half a second to decide.
[SPEAKER_03]: You going to shoot him or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're shooting them every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six or eight times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six or eight times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until that gun goes click, click,
click, click.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judges be like, why didn't you shoot
them 17 times?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only 16 bullets.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big Lebowski reference for all
the people that didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real trick here though, is to just be
calm and go through the script that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not doing something you're not
supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people are doing something we
shouldn't be doing a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember how it used to be in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have to drive and go pick up
weed and drive it home all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the time that I was most at
risk is when I just went and picked up a
[SPEAKER_01]: new quarter and had to drive it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made it real easy on myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw it in a backpack when I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw that backpack in the trunk when I
got to the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I got pulled over on the way home,
it wasn't for speeding because I did my
[SPEAKER_01]: damnedest not to break a single traffic
law with weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cruise control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got pulled over plenty of times with
weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they walk up to your car and you
go, good evening officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't stink like weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, oh, I pulled you over for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me run your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's your ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You show up to court, you pay that bitch,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit driving 105 on I-25, Rasta Jeff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruise control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think looking them in the eyes is
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're hiding something,
take off your shades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be respectful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can be calm and confident,
they don't wonder why you're nervous and
[SPEAKER_01]: try to figure out why you're freaking out
and want to dig through your car.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hardest part for me is when they make
you sign the ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, I sign my name like I get a
little motion, but then you get all
[SPEAKER_03]: nervous and your shit looks like fucking
polygraph or some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, officer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look like you've got a major
neurological disorder.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always sign sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if that happens, I guess I don't
know what I'm going to try to sign my real
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_03]: You end up going to jail and they're going
to, oh, our buddy's headphones here have
[SPEAKER_03]: taken a poo on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they back now?
[SPEAKER_03]: You in business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's this connection here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to sign sloppy one time and
they're going to make that your real name.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to sign everything as
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my alias under the NC inmate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is so sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unfortunately, unfortunately,
I got arrested once and my hat said sloppy
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they take it down because your gang
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he brought it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, I can only assume that you're
sloppy, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had it tatted on my arm for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had it on your arm for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's covered up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this dude have a tattoo for a
while?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have covered all of my gang affiliation
tattoos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to be a good person now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to be a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the old heads one day looked at me
and said, all that is, is a bullseye for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that doesn't like you and the
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh my God, that is genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, well, you walk down the shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just telling everybody like,
you don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, that makes a lot of sense.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now let's move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all, we all know how to, what to do if
you get pulled over now, pull the fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: over as quickly as you can safely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull the fuck over, keep your hands where
they can see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let the cop come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be like, I want your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't flirt with a female cop that
pisses her off so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't call him Ms. Carter.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cop will come up and be like,
Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: And be like, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let that interaction go smoothly.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they ask for your stuff, tell them
you're going to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to reach for into the glove box.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask them to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask them if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I reach in my glove box and grab my
license?
[SPEAKER_03]: Registration proof of insurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to reach in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get my wallet out now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't shoot me, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hand him your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend everybody records interactions
with the police's as soon as you're pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: over, turn your camera phone on places
somewhere or like, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Stream it live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stream it periscope periscope that
periscope it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then like, yo, I mean,
why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, Hey, I don't want everyone seeing me
cry on periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can record it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extra layer of protection for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're lucky, you live in a place
where the cops have cameras stuck to their
[SPEAKER_01]: chest that they can't turn off,
but you're not lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you drive away, don't get
all nervous and do something stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try not to peel out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't celebrate too hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, officer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was nervous as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I was thinking about
earlier today that I had to realize as an
[SPEAKER_00]: adult is a not every officer is a fucking
scumbag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: By saying that every officer is just
trying to make your day worse is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: being racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the same as labeling a race is
doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just job is or some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every fast food person is going to be an
asshole and every cop is trying to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: you over because I've seen cool cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've interacted with cops who are
literally just trying to do their jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know cops that have given me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I was younger, like 24 or 25 ish,
my girlfriend at the time worked,
[SPEAKER_03]: managed a bar and we would go smoke in the
alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an alleyway that went one way
and you could turn left or right to come
[SPEAKER_03]: into the parking lot of the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the other way, you'll go
through another area.
[SPEAKER_03]: This cop would roll through and he knew we
were out there just puffing all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: in that alley because you could just walk
right out of the side door of the bar and
[SPEAKER_03]: go sit in this little area between cars
and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he would come through and flash
his brights, put our shit away and be
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared to do, he wouldn't have to fuck
with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would just rather not see us smoking or
maybe he's got somebody else in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not all cops are assholes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy was trying to help us out,
like not have to do paperwork and fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: with us just because we want to smoke some
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, I've just had dozens of
interactions with... When I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: teenager, I used to get pulled over like
twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a car that had really loud
subwoofers in the area I grew up in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me the biggest target on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you follow the script nine times
out of 10, you're out of there in 15
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We rarely see any good shit about the cops
on the news, on the internet, on TV,
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere like that because you rarely hear
anything about the good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people do good shit, it's like,
oh yeah, that cop helped that old lady up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his fucking job.
[SPEAKER_03]: You only see cop kick the guy in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually... No, let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In psychology class, I learned about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually life, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice people talking about stuff a
lot or even the news, it's never good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff because even though it's unknown,
you don't realize that good stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bad stuff is a blip on the radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you remember in reference to
because it's usually things are
[SPEAKER_00]: copestetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When something bad happens, it really
sticks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to hear like, a hundred
kids were saved today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hear puppies getting kicked
off of a cliff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are fucked up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see bad stuff and it gives them...
Puppies getting kicked off of a cliff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a fucking vine of six seconds of
just somebody punting puppies and it just
[SPEAKER_03]: replays over and over in my fucking head
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally feel like people want to see
bad things so they have a reason to fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary fire to complain about why
they're not doing well or to use it to why
[SPEAKER_00]: things are so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially here in America, we are so
privileged as Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate this whole anti-American thing
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: People standing on flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see you standing on a flag,
I'm running you over in my Prius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know why?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is fleeing from America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not putting your family on a door
and pushing it into the ocean to get
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: America is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no death threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's nighttime, we're in here making
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not having one of us make sure that
death troopers aren't coming and killing
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in our fucking village.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate people that are like, oh,
America is horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're able to be the person that you
want to be because you're in America
[SPEAKER_00]: because being yourself in other countries
can get you fucking murdered.
[SPEAKER_00]: As shitty as that sounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This jar of weed, this is probably about a
half ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: A half ounce of weed right here in most
countries would probably get your head cut
[SPEAKER_03]: off, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not most, but several.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a few, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot of countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be the- Jail time in most.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are so free to do even- There are a lot
of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't downplay that there are
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there are.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the grand scheme of things,
he's completely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can drive down the street and get 75
different kinds of food.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can drive our own vehicles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet everybody in this room has varying
religious beliefs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to ask,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we could all express them by having,
I've got a tattoo here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your symbols there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have a good idea of what you
follow, and I'm sure you two link up in
[SPEAKER_03]: the same similar sort of way from
conversations we've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in other countries, one of us would be
beheaded for what we all believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be fighting to the death right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the very, very least spend all day
pretending that wasn't you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't have these dreadlocks in a lot
of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of states, not Colorado,
you'd get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked you this when we first met at one
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally asked you, how the fuck do you
not get pulled over all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because you don't stand out in
Colorado anymore, especially not in
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the listeners don't realize,
I've been told so many times that my voice
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't match my appearance when people
meet me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when I'm at the store at Green
and Healthy Wellness, I'll go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy a lot of product there, and I also
deliver products sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I should have said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might edit that shit out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy a lot of product there, and when I
do, sometimes I bump into people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: shopping, and they're like, I recognize
that voice, and they turn around,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they look at me, and they're not sure
if that dreadlock guy is the guy from the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: The listeners that aren't privy,
I guess, I'm 6'5", and I've got dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_03]: seriously to past my ass, mid-thigh,
region, almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the really longer ones goes almost
to my kneecaps by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel pressure from the police sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cop yesterday asked me, he said,
how long did it take you to get those
[SPEAKER_03]: dreadlocks that long?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 11 years, and he goes, wow,
commitment, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That cop was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the courthouse getting
fingerprinted for when I worked at a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody had to go get fingerprinted and
had to go take a day off because it took
[SPEAKER_03]: them all a fucking day to fingerprint me.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cop in there walked by, and he goes,
great dreadlocks, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that was a cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That cop complimented my dreadlocks just
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He meant it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't even being sarcastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a smile on his face and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all cops are cocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cops are cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a freak, and sometimes I do feel some
pressure from the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all that America stuff times is
good with the police, because that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: a big thing going on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could really just go on about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on, slob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media warriors and stuff,
people who are just bitching about the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what we were just talking
about earlier, public executions and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff, I think that for one hour out
of the week- Were we talking about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were talking about other
countries being fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike gave me a look of like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, we're all high, and this is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sharp left.
[SPEAKER_01]: This conversation's brought to you by
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brought to you by marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that everybody should be made to
watch one hour of what's really going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in other countries, like a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hour a week of show me what's up in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me what's up in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show you what's really fucked up,
because people really think we have it bad
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a great idea, but I think
it's all about the source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you going to get that material?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking internet has all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has people being publicly executed by
the hundreds and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does it have the good also?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have the good as well as the bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is, I was just referencing
to the fact that people bitch about
[SPEAKER_00]: America so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really okay here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went to Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time ever in Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think someone like Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got into a debate with my friend
there, because she's an active feminist
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, which I support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she said that women don't have a lot
of rights here, and they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: restrained, and so on and so forth,
which in some ways I do see,
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically, they get paid less and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as freedoms of the world,
women are really free in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate to say it, but in other
countries, women are still getting stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: to death for talking to males in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got women running for president.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, things are different, but we are
farly advanced in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that sounds weird to say,
but how can people find you on Twitter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy919.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angry tweet me if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure all of the tweets about the
anti-feminism statements are headed
[SPEAKER_03]: towards Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say anything about anti.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said I'm totally for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some microaggressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was just a statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You almost swallowed your whole blunt when
I said the word microaggression.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a new word for this generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man, stand up for whoever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in all... I also think that... I
think it's fucked up that it's fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: to be proud of your heritage nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's like, I'm Italian and
da-da-da-da.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's with their roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to be guilty of cultural
appropriation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a step away from being
racist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost... It's a foot into the racist
category, which it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, racism is...
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it just having pride in one's race?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't bigotry the real problem or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it shouldn't be a thin line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should be proud of who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're German, be proud you're German.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're black, be proud you're black.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're Asian, be... You know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's when you add hate to it,
like, oh, I don't like these other people
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're not this, then it becomes
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it's misinterpreted a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just see what they want to see
straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take any story and make it good
or bad by changing minor details,
[SPEAKER_00]: altering shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two people can read the same book and get
totally different stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two people can watch the same car accident
and tell two totally different stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perspective is a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And watch the same fight have two totally
different stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both people won.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike beat the shit out of Jeff and you'll
be like, Jeff beat the shit out of Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was stomping him.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Mike had him the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard stuff like that, like back in
school shit, like both people won.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, who won then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all just like... Everybody is... Is Hulk
and Superman here?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, we got way off course
here, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my fault for bringing up the America
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to squeeze it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashtag, I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about what to do if you get pulled
over by the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, behave yourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't reach too quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all saw the video of the guy that
reached into his car to get his ID and got
[SPEAKER_03]: blasted by the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't reach so quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to get a good recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever said that is a genius.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slav, high five since you got your hand
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: High five you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: High five on record it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so how about if we're sitting
here, Mike, I'm going to...
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask you, let's go Mike first.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say I just gave you the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doorbell rings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not even doorbell, it's this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking this sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pounding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cop knock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's heart sinks when you hear that
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your pizza boy is knocking like that,
fuck him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tip him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't knock like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know right away, shit,
it's the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you handle that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a quick look around the room and make
sure there's nothing laying there that I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't want laying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a habit from back when weed
was illegal here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a good tip for anybody that's not
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have knocked so hard on the
fucking table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how cops knock like that
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why they're annoyed when I open
the doors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because their fucking hand hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubbing their hand on their jeans all
like, fuck, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke my knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So open the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then see what they've got to say at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nine times out of 10, if they were
there and you were in real trouble,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have knocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your door would have exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: A flashback would have gone off and you'd
have an M16 planted in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're knocking, they just want to ask
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just if you're not interested,
say you're not interested, come back with
[SPEAKER_01]: a warrant and politely end the
conversation and step back inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're like asking about something
that happened up the street or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to talk to them, step out
onto the porch and pull the door shut
[SPEAKER_01]: behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit there and have the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you almost lock yourself out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't open the door and go in for any
reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A warrant like without probable cause that
like there's a crime being committed
[SPEAKER_01]: inside or that somebody's in distress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if the cop says, well,
Mike, I'd like to take a look inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we believe you did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that we're here to accuse you
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back with a warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to look inside, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go inside and shut the door
and continue on my evening officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a warrant, please come
back later with one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have anything to hide,
Mike, there shouldn't be a problem with us
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in and taking a look, don't you
think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a nice night.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for thanks for playing along.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucking win.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like a dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a lot scarier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: A really small one because you won.
[SPEAKER_01]: He played that perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the right answers over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you've got a lot of rights and
knowing how to exercise them is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a pen or type flex your rights dot
com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just Google flex your rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a series of videos put on by a
defense attorney out of Baltimore who's
[SPEAKER_01]: really fun to watch on video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really nice to know exactly what
to do when you run into law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google flex your rights, flex your rights,
flex your rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we should have gone there before we
did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to review it before I came over,
but I got a kid now and I had to try not
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I read something the other day
that says that undercover vehicles cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Operate normal traffic stops in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know if that's true or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a Chevy Tahoe ish looking vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be certain on the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like a Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull somebody over on I-25 the other day
while I was in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have somebody who works at the
Honda dealership that said that he got
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled over by undercover and they said,
you don't have insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you're not supposed to be
pulling people over in this vehicle and
[SPEAKER_00]: they let him go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I know I don't never
believe 100 percent what people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was trying to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a car dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he just he's a mechanic.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I was going to say if he's a car
dealer, he already loses a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: credibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, you want me to turn your mic up over
there, Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let him die right on my.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your baby, baby lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are you'll end up sounding like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get you off of that, we're going to
have an intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one day we're going to tell him
we're having a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be an intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck we're just talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching trivia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quiz sloppy, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I do, because I'm a pet owner,
I'm putting my dog somewhere where they
[SPEAKER_00]: can act aggressive towards the police
because fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they will shoot your fucking dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, like not trying to sound
like crazy or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they shoot my dogs in front of me,
I'm catching some charges because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: swinging.
[SPEAKER_00]: No regrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoding that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs look fucking scary as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're so lovable, but they're 90
pounds of pit bulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes I forget that they're like
that because people are like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get in their face, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cuddle with those dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sleep in my bed every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, I'm putting my dogs up and
then I I'm going to answer the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I see that it's the
authorities, I am stepping out and closing
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you said that, that's exactly I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them looking at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to have reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that while one of them talks to the
other one searches as much of your house
[SPEAKER_00]: as he can be lurking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a grinder on the table or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want none of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands out of your pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's a key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have your hands in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the ultimate question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Mr. Sloppy, I'd like to come inside
and take a look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I want to make sure you didn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did the crime that we're here to
invent that we're here to invent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have a warrant, don't don't
let them do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them fucking in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, from from past experience,
even if they have a warrant, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do whatever the fuck they want,
because the one time I was arrested was
[SPEAKER_00]: this exact scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stepped out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the gas station to get a dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with my friend Julian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've told this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Julian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Killa Jules and see he makes
beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dear God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but no, I think I've told this story
on the cast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we we pulled up to the gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like half a mile from the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mad cops swarmed the car and get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like full tactical gear and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're yelling at Julian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was mistaken identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally thought that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they looked at me and said my
government name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had the warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed me the warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in a third story apartment,
one way in, one way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told them the door was unlocked,
said my girlfriend's in there with my dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in like you already have all the
paperwork at school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went up there and still busted out
every window, flash banged my girlfriend,
[SPEAKER_00]: tasered the dog and knocked the door in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told them where everything was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cut my cushions open,
broke my fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found half a gram of marijuana,
a bong and an unregistered firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't 21 yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was three months away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told them the door was unlocked to
go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still blew that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they have the warrant, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have the warrant,
get the fuck out of my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they've got the warrant, they're pretty
much doing what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't knock anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: They booted in that fucking door.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it was, was they planned on doing
that to me anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to the store and he was
like, oh, he took all the fun out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had all of our toys polished.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to come play with our toys.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all know what to do now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops come to the door, step outside,
talk to them, be kind, keep your hands
[SPEAKER_03]: where they can see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If if a cop asks for your ID, you do not
have to present ID, but it helps with the
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to keep on that, like polite,
like I don't want to go to jail side
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me a fucking ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not hiding anything,
you can you can flex your rights and be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I don't have to give you my ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just kind of being a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of YouTube videos where
you can really learn your rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people really enjoy pulling the
am I detained?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I free to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are YouTube channels that are solely
dedicated to people harassing police
[SPEAKER_02]: officers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was walking down the street with
assault rifles just to get a rile out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, sir, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be here because of HB forty one
seven paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and my nunchucks and samurai sword and
butt ass naked are fairly legal right
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, depending on where you live in
the US, like along our southern states,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything bordering Mexico, they've got
random highway checkpoints where they look
[SPEAKER_01]: for immigration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Documents and all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that's unconstitutional and
it really pisses people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people who know exactly how to flex
their rights in a very specific way risk
[SPEAKER_01]: giving the living shit beaten out of them
and thrown in jail and go flex their
[SPEAKER_01]: rights at fucking massive checkpoints and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only exactly how to do that makes
getting pulled over really easy to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you stay calm and keep your hands in
plain sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ask them what is your info out of the
globe?
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you're walking down the street?
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you're just down on fucking Fourth
Street walking from one store to the
[SPEAKER_03]: other?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of fucking dark out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cop walks up to you and he's like,
hey, you come here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cop just walks out of nowhere or he
comes from somewhere specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: He there's a manhole.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a rapist.
[SPEAKER_03]: The manhole smoothly slid over and the cop
elevated slowly out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that means the devil or a ninja or a
ninja turtle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know where he came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and I were talking or blah,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cop pops up, bumps into us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can I help you, officer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, sir?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see your ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: You reach in your pocket and hand me your
ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm just standing there and it's not
harassing me or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that question depends what other items
are on my person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just about to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's where I'm headed next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like you guys were we saw you guys
smoking some weed back there when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I saw you and you fucking reek like
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an opinion, not a fact, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I like the way you're going with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I'm going to mace you,
tase you and hit you with something and
[SPEAKER_03]: then put you in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my perfume.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one and only benefit ever to
smoking cigarettes, is that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: always smelled like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could like point to the cigarettes
in my pocket and be like, no, sir,
[SPEAKER_01]: Marlboro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd go, oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the line of questioning would
change like instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when does the why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to I want to search pockets,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're the guy smoking weed over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't consent to any search.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I need to search you,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't consent to any searches,
sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I being detained?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any grounds to detain you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have a good evening, officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I run your name first?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm free to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to run your name and then I'll
let you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go because you're an asshole and
you know you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stay really calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like if you're screaming, am I being
detained?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is going to be yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just calmly I'm I'm sorry,
sir, I have somewhere to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I being detained?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not being detained, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I free to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, good luck investigating whatever
it is you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What me look.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of weeks ago, weekends ago,
two or three weekends ago, by the time
[SPEAKER_03]: this podcast comes out, it would be three
weekends.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an event called the Frost Bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Frost Bowl was a local cannabis
competition where people grew cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: enter their cannabis and people were
judging it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a party where people were
consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the police came.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they raided that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't rate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The word they used was rated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they came and shut it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were like thirty five cops that
surrounded the place and all stormed in
[SPEAKER_03]: all at once and shut the place down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say we're at an event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to change my event now,
because I was going to say the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as of the past couple of days,
it doesn't not look like the Denver
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Cup is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're currently looking for a new venue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, new venue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like a lot of places are not
going to be able to give that permit that
[SPEAKER_03]: they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Pueblo State Fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: State Fair is already said they don't want
anything to do with any cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody wants to come to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if you build it, they will
come.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say you're walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Cannabis Cup happens at the State
Fairgrounds in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could fucking take an Uber over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It cost me six bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: An Uber over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm walking around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, I don't know, four grams of
shatter in my pocket, seven grams of good
[SPEAKER_03]: flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, let's be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an ounce of good flour and I got
like 10 grams of shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my possession, I'm legal to carry that
as an adult in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cop walks up to me and wants to give me
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I handle myself with this cop in
public?
[SPEAKER_03]: At an event, at a cannabis event where I'm
going to be fucked with, sorry,
[SPEAKER_03]: I said straight in public, but it's at an
event where we're all consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, come here, I want to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd immediately like stop moving my feet
and make sure my hands were in plain sight
[SPEAKER_01]: and just be like, what can I do for you,
officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd offer to smoke with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of resist their questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the, am I being detained?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I free to go circle?
[SPEAKER_01]: In an event like that, especially like I'm
not there to get messed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not carrying a weapon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't steal anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm just not in the mood to be
harassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I'd play it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the mood to be harassed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you say that to the cop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it hasn't really come up that I've
had to run it like that since I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: teenager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the good evening officer,
how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't matter if it's,
oh, I was speeding or oh, we got a noise
[SPEAKER_01]: complaint or oh, it smells like weed out
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you started off that way nine
times out of 10, just being polite and
[SPEAKER_01]: going like, no, I don't consent to any
searches.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've got stuff to do later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sorry guys, what can I do to help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually that gets you through it in five
or 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst case scenario, they go get out of
the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: They search your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They write you a ticket for the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds reasonable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sloppy standing up, taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't bump the rig on the mics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't dab the microphone like you did
last time you were here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even if you're about to get in a
bunch of trouble, playing it cool with the
[SPEAKER_01]: original interaction with the officer,
a suit assures you don't get really
[SPEAKER_01]: injured during that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get injured.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I didn't mention earlier that I
should have totally mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cop that pulled my friend over and
gave him a DUI asked him how long it had
[SPEAKER_03]: been since he smoked last.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend tried to play Mr. Honesty and
told him a little too early, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that played a part of the arrest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if that cop's like, how long ago
you're driving and you pulled over,
[SPEAKER_03]: cop's like, when is the last time you
smoked cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I went to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only smoked cannabis to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or any of those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the cop goes, how long has it been
since you've consumed marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say, I don't, or I'm not legally
obligated to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plead to fist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're driving, you're required to
hand over like license registration,
[SPEAKER_01]: proof of insurance, but you're not legally
required to self incriminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not legally required to answer any
other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry snitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them the minimum amount of
information that you need to give them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go on with stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're legally obligated to comply and you
can get arrested for just resisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the cop walks up and you run away,
like the cop didn't even say anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just saw him walk onto your block or
whatever and immediately turned and ran
[SPEAKER_01]: and he chose to chase you and arrest you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get arrested for just resisting
arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got arrested for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All charges got dropped immediately,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: A relation of mine got arrested just for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were climbing through the window of a
party while he was in high school and he
[SPEAKER_01]: put his arms out just to the sides and
went, get out of my house piggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got tackled and handcuffed and he
thought it was hilarious, but he knew he'd
[SPEAKER_01]: survive it because after he was tackled
and handcuffed, like he could do and say
[SPEAKER_01]: what he wanted and he was going to get
bailed out in less than 24 hours anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I, I was young on probation
walking with an other friend that was on
[SPEAKER_00]: probation and we had heard that if you're
on probation, you're not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: with other people on probation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cops came up on us and I darted
and then I had a little dub sack on me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I threw it and then I got arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I, like I went to jail,
got bailed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as I went to court,
he was like, where are the other charges?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, well, what else did you get
charged from us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just ran because I thought I wasn't
supposed to be hanging out with this
[SPEAKER_00]: person automatically dropped, let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on my right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's a, that's an easy
choice to get out of if you're just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, even if you're about to get in
trouble, it's so much easier to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: in court without the, why did you run
away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why did you leave him on a car
chase?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why did you injure detective
so-and-so with your door?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that type of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just play it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, no, I burped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I wanted to be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just let it go into the
mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, it was directed towards you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you that Dr. Pepper stain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those 23 Terps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavors for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavors for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I pour other drinks in there,
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, uh, interesting thing about the
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting pulled over by an
unmarked vehicle, would you pull over or
[SPEAKER_00]: would you call it in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm a, I'm a dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I can handle myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like for the most part,
I got pretty good judgment of what a cop
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I, I'm not trying to be sexist
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were a small woman who wasn't as
fucking, wasn't six, five and 200 pounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some girls that I'm not even
trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could pick some girls up and just
fucking carry them off.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was that size of a girl, I would,
I don't know, I'd reconsider my options.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just call 911 and be like,
Hey, is this cop that's pulling me over
[SPEAKER_03]: for real?
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll tell you if it is or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hit your hazard lights, slow way
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get over all the way to the right and then
just do like four miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why you call 911?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I really being pulled over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm a tiny woman or I'm in a sketchy
part of town or da da da da.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like a cop car except for
the flashing lights and the windshield.
[SPEAKER_01]: 911 will know if you're being pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if it's not, they'll send people
to pull over whoever's trying to pull you
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just sit there with your windows
up and wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way they can get the person
that's trying to fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you all remember when that was an
issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, it still is from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every now and then you'll see in the
police blotter was someone was arrested
[SPEAKER_01]: for, um, like a year ago it happened here,
but they pulled over a cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And immediately he was like, you ain't a
cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, got out with his gun and was
like somebody going to jail in North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina, somebody who was impersonating
as an officer and, uh, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: robbing people like, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, would you, do you think that you
have to roll your window down all the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: or can you just do it the next necessary
amount to talk and exchange?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is that being a douche?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you pushing the limit by not giving
them the full window?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what, what are you trying to prove?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just roll it down and talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if somebody's going to assault you,
they're doing it through the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That glass ain't stopping though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how can I lick your ball sack today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's why you play it cool from the
get-go so that the cop doesn't decide to
[SPEAKER_01]: play it the hardest way possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they could just decide to arrest you
and come through that window.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just roll that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you put the weed in the back
seat or in the trunk, throw it in an extra
[SPEAKER_01]: bag or a backpack so that your car doesn't
stink while you're in the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have a roach burning in the ashtray
when you get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Oseum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, man, I, I have to get on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke and drive shit for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be careful with that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: DUIs are no fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do get fucking pulled over,
if you get fucked, get yourself a good
[SPEAKER_03]: lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't afford a lawyer, get the free
public defender one or go to a law school
[SPEAKER_01]: in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine times out of 10, they've got a third
year law student who would fucking love to
[SPEAKER_01]: defend the living shit out of you for
free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't believe what all your pothead
friends are going to tell you and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they'll hype you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll get you scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll make you feel relaxed,
but they, they're just, they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not a judge.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what's going to happen to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get, take their advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take your crazy uncle Larry's
advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go down there and tell them that you
are this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just carry a fake ID and get arrested as
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy, bad, bad, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather get caught in a little weed
than with a fake ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so we've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, uh, yeah, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've made it an hour with us,
that's, that's, that's a journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time flies when there's a bunch of people
at the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it sure does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so does anybody have, uh, would you
like to shout out any social media or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything, anything that you want to say
since you've got a microphone in your face
[SPEAKER_03]: and some people is listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start going, we'll just go to the
left here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got anything you'd like to say over
there, my friend?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of quiet this episode, but it's all
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike had a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just hanging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for being here, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, why Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be safe people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get, uh, don't get fucked by being
nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do our friends follow you on social
media?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me at at NemoPunk15 on
Twitter or, uh, Pueblo for sensible
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click it, give it a like, follow it,
check out what Mike posts, share it,
[SPEAKER_03]: observe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do people should start paying attention to
politics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get registered to vote?
[SPEAKER_01]: This next year is going to be interesting
in most states.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if Randy ever listens to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor Randy and his little square dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he, uh, he doesn't read anything that
he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: He suspects might not be pre-approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting way of educating
oneself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody, somebody shared this podcast
with Randy, let him learn the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to move over to you,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming again, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you got to take time away from your
your youngster to come hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: High five your boy for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sloppy, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can all the people listening,
how can they find you on social media?
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, however you
want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sloppy nine one nine on everything
except for Tumblr.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's sloppy brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, sloppy brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I didn't make that, but somebody made
it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, uh, yeah, dead God nine one
nine as well is our music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay out the left lane people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dude, are you fucking serious?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I, oh my God, I'm turning beat red
over here trying not to smack the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I drive 50 miles to and from work every
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 50 miles each way.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred miles on the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there's one exit where I go that
probably takes me 10 minutes just to get
[SPEAKER_03]: on the damn on ramp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the construction in Colorado
Springs right now, uh, if you're in the
[SPEAKER_03]: left lane, you should be passing somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I am behind you in the left lane and
you think I'm writing your ass,
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the left lane is for passing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That lane over there to the right is for
the slower moving traffic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are big signs on the interstate that
say slower traffic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means fucking you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if I'm writing your, if I'm writing
your ass in the left lane, all it means is
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a conceited fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't flick your cigarette at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give me the finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put on your damn blinker and move over and
let me zip past you and then get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even care if you're going 10 miles
over and I'm trying to go 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, not to sound like, like a,
like fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the left lane is the go as fast as you
please and risk getting a ticket lane
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, you're passing people and then
get back in the right lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you pass somebody, get in the
right lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People be like, Oh, you're weaving a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, I'm driving correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Ooh, Ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out the left lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out the left lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sign every five miles that says
keep right in less passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't be that, that social justice
warrior that tries to slow me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pull in front of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your road.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is our road.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to get a ticket, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw water bottles at people straight
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bonked a couple of people with water
bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how the breeze not to do things
now that you've grown up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, Soppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, driving is driving is not a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're playing with people's lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes when people do stupid shit on
the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I drive a Prius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to get beat up by the guy
that was driving the Prius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then you got to go home and lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be like, it was six guys in a
Jeep and then no, it was one dude with a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Bob Ross Afro hopping out here and
whooping your ass out the Prius and then
[SPEAKER_00]: getting back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tattooed Bob Ross and the Prius beat my
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then driving away and all yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello from the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adele.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to be tough when you pull up in
your car and it goes wing, wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's where you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear the Prius pull up at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have literally had people in the car and
then drove off and they're like,
