an eye to a grow room injury, now's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time to click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 778 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
different light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump into that part of the show,
let's do a few shout outs to a few of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends who continue to support the show
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick it off with a big grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you shout out to my friend Dio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a fist bump and a thank you
shout out to Canna Reaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Mobius Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a fist bump and a thank you
shout out to G7 and Aron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you to Simeon
and Dreadlock Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you to Noah N and Green
Goblin Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a high five and a thank you
shout out to my buddy ADHD Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's wrap it all up with a big grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you shout out to Stoned Trout Bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the podcast on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it super easy for all of my friends
to support the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to start off by saying thank you
to everybody who supported the Black
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listened to the last episode,
I did mention a Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It I redirect that sale has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will continue for a couple of days
after this episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be Black Friday, Cyber Monday,
and then it'll just be kind of stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday and lingering Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll probably have to wrap up the
sale pretty quickly after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for the huge support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sale is still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that did purchase beans from
that sale did get freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets freebies every time you
order from I redirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those people will get freebies
that are tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are clearly labeled that they are
tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them will come with a pamphlet
that tells you what I hope will happen and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I expect of those tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing I really require you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be cool if when you get those
tester seeds, if you go to my Discord and
[SPEAKER_00]: post some pictures of the progress,
post some pictures to social media of
[SPEAKER_00]: those tester beans, they are a free gift
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in return, I would love some
photography, maybe a grow report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did get those tester beans in
the package without the pamphlet,
[SPEAKER_00]: please join the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the info will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did get the pamphlet that I
recently got printed, it took a while to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that here because of holiday shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the orders did come with a
tester pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got testers, please join the
Discord and post your pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that is a good way to segue
into talking about my new method of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been overwhelmed with tester
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to run tester seeds
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that you are so enthusiastic about
my brand and that you've got so much trust
[SPEAKER_00]: in my product that you're willing to run
testers before I've even tried them or
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out brand new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that happens is I select
a lot of testers, I send them seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: only about maybe 50 or 60 percent of those
testers will actually reply and put
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and post pictures of the progress
of the plants on any form of social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I make a lot of donations with
brand new seeds is kind of what it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I was making a lot of donations with
the seeds and people would fail to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue correspondence, I've decided just
to give the testers away with orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're purchasing seeds from Ivory
Direct, there's a good chance you'll get a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of tester seeds in that order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some brand new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got things that a lot of people do
not have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got things that are not for sale at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got testers, you're getting
those because I want those ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run them at your leisure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could run them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run them later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you run them, just tag me,
post some pictures, maybe join the Discord
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help me determine if those seeds
are worth putting out to the general
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they grow well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do they do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they successful in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything I should notice,
anything that may make me not want to put
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a bunch of people to grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest way is to include them
with paid orders and let people get them
[SPEAKER_00]: as a free gift, as a free thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I may add tester seeds to
the website for a very low price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned that people respect things
they pay for a lot more than free things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will get more communication,
more correspondence, more feedback if I
[SPEAKER_00]: just give them to you as a gift with your
paid order or if I charge you just a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum price for those tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be changing up the way we do
testers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are testing, if you're running test
seeds, if you've been involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want all of your feedback,
all of your reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send all of that to the Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join my Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link in the show notes in the
video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the tester tab and please post away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post weekly grow reports, weekly pictures,
weekly updates, anything that you think I
[SPEAKER_00]: should know about that strain that anybody
else growing that strain may want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that is helpful, useful,
any sort of advice, guidance or tips you
[SPEAKER_00]: can give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was amazing or even if you saw
something terrible in a seed line that I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave you as a tester, please report that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just want good feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know if those seeds are worth
worthy and worthwhile to send to other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't work well for you,
let us know so I can consider holding them
[SPEAKER_00]: back and not putting them out to the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what a responsible breeder should
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a long ramble on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get some testers in your
packages and the testers may appear on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a small price, all I'm asking for in
return is photos and grow reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get really low priced and
basically free seeds in exchange for
[SPEAKER_00]: quality grow reports and high quality
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I ask of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That felt like that took a lot longer than
it should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I mention that every order that I
redirect does get free beans?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that, but that is on the
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one more thing I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a happy holiday
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording right after the
Thanksgiving holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you celebrate that,
but my family had a great holiday
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some good food, some good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody who gathered for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also after that, I was gifted a piece of
medicated pumpkin pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: When one of my friends said that they made
pumpkin pie and they infused it with
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja, you know that I had to take a fat
slice of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate that about 40 minutes ago and I can
honestly feel it starting to work now as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the intro to the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how long I've been
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been 15 minutes or it could
have been three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I really do not know,
but it's going to be a great podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: because medicated pumpkin pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more fun thing I want to
ramble about here before we segue into the
[SPEAKER_00]: main topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my
friends at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to give a big shout out to
Big J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the lovely Zara, Ms. Dread Vibes,
Mrs. Irie, as you guys also call her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take her to see Big J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson at ComedyWorks on Saturday night
at the Late Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The staff and crew at ComedyWorks treat
myself and Ms. Dread Vibes like we are
[SPEAKER_00]: royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat us like rock stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody from ComedyWorks hears this,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have a great time at that club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the best comedy club on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys treat me well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always a good show at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go to ComedyWorks, free
advertising for the club right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also a big shout out to, I should also
give a big shout out to Zara, Ms. Dread
[SPEAKER_00]: Vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely, lovely date for the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson did about an hour worth of
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first 15 or 20 minutes of that
was just him roasting myself and Ms. Dread
[SPEAKER_00]: Vibes, Mrs. Irie, Zara, whatever you'd
like to call her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a bunch of great jokes about our
dreadlocks, about just cliche dreadlock
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the second time that I've seen Big
J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson in the front row at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I should mention I was in the front
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the front row for that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the second time that I've seen
Big J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually asked me a couple of the
same questions as he did last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was giving him similar answers and
hoping it would trigger some memories,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the dude was so stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way he was going to even
remember any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to ComedyWorks for
treating myself and Ms. Dread Vibes like a
[SPEAKER_00]: rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Ms. Dread Vibes or Ms.
Zara for being a fucking rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, of course, big shout out to Big
J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson for coming to Colorado,
crushing it, throwing down a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys follow Big J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out all of his podcasts,
Legion of Skanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bonfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all over the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Philly shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wraps up the Rasta Jeff portion of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move in to the email portion of this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great email here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name said,
but it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says here is a good podcast question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was just thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing some stuff from another
breeder and some of the machine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have stated that the machine has a
very strong odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can that odor actually change the flavor
profile of other strains being grown in a
[SPEAKER_00]: four by four tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other cultivars have a very different
profile than your machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are more fruity smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mentioned before that the machine
does make gassy chemical aromas that are
[SPEAKER_00]: very potent and very pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like you're growing other stuff that
makes a fruity turf profile, a fruity
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more you're kind of concerned about
those flavors intermingling and crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that stanky nasty machine
to mess up the fruit candy of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think that you've got to worry
about that during the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the grow cycle, I do not think
those turps will intermingle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they'll contaminate each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that will be a problem
during the grow phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to produce turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps will volatize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will continue to produce
terpenes as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we shift into the drying and
cure phase, at that point, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely contaminate and cross flavor
the things in the room by having maybe if
[SPEAKER_00]: you put the machine next to a strawberry
flavored plant, some of that chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma and some of that strawberry aroma
that may travel over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the aroma getting stuck
into the dried buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit of a different
phenomenon there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't worry about it so much in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to drying and cure it,
keep those separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, don't put them in the same
container together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dry them in the same room in the
same space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to curing them and
you're sealing them, that's when I would
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the aroma is going to transfer
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really, it's just the aroma
sticking in the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've been around weed and it
gets in your shirt, that weed smell is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stick in the other buds,
just like the weed smell sticks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have absolute science on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, I would not be worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown 20 different kinds of plants in
the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a warehouse environment, we'll run 20
or 30 different strains in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromas and flavors do not mix that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to drying and curing,
I would keep them separate when you put
[SPEAKER_00]: them into containers, because that's when
your aromas and flavors could get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: muddled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful with the drying and curing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where most of the flavor and aroma
mistakes do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say your name,
but that was a great question,
[SPEAKER_00]: my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two questions here that are going
to segue us into a nice long ramble here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read both of these messages
and then I will kind of address them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from the Patreon and it
says, Yo Rasta Jeff, what episode can I
[SPEAKER_00]: hear more about 18 six in late flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very interested in learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that one is this episode,
my dude, I'm going to talk about it in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says quickish question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think plants finish more quickly in
the last two weeks of flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you switch to 18 six or 10 14,
that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you once said reducing light helps
them finish more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the most recent show, you said 18
six helps them finish more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised to hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done 18 six many times and it
definitely helps revenge and maybe more
[SPEAKER_00]: flower development, but faster finish,
which is faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the great shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still hoping for more strain reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, my dude, more strain reviews
are coming, but let's jump into this one
[SPEAKER_00]: for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is a good case of, uh,
me having been growing for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've been in commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in giant grows and small grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in garages, uh, LEDs,
HPS, every kind of lighting you could
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of the things to notice here is
that, um, I've changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've adapted things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing things differently than I have
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to adjust and adapt and
try new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus more on the main part of
this question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question is talking more about
18 six and late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we hear another listener mentioned
the 10 hours on and 14 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about flowering
cycles and flowering times, why we do the
[SPEAKER_00]: times we do and what we're hoping to
achieve by altering these flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most commonly we're using 12 hours on
and 12 hours off to flower our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing 12 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is equal amount of on as off
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that we are running that 12 12
is because that's what we have noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: works for most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is called the critical
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants need a certain amount of dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some plants that may be 10 hours of
darkness, some plants that may be closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to 13 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we have learned from what we are
breeding from what we have bred for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: use, most of the plants we are working
with flower very well with a 12 hour on
[SPEAKER_00]: and 12 hour off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works very well for most of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a long time ago, a breeder known as
DJ short came and he taught us that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see more phenotypical expression and more
variation if we adjust our light timer to
[SPEAKER_00]: give those plants a little bit more
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra hour of darkness will show you,
like I said a moment ago, more
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical expression, more variation in
your plants, sometimes more aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes different aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are advantages to running an 11
on and 13 off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very similar to our 10 and 14,
which our friend mentioned here,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11, 13, 10, 14, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get very similar results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get very similar effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to get more sleeping
time, less daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to express their
characteristics a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our basic 12-12 cycle that
most people run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been tried and true for most of the
plants that we've been breeding for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been breeding indoors with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works well for the stock we have been
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've adjusted our rooms to work with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've adjusted the plants to work in our
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things that take longer or shorter
than that have simply been eliminated by
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the plants are going to work in
12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got our 11-13 or 10-14,
which is going to show you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the new thing that I have been working
with is I do 12 hours on and 12 hours off
[SPEAKER_00]: for most of the flowering cycle,
just like most of you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the end of that cycle,
when I begin to flush my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a whole nother controversial
topic, which we'll talk about in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I begin to flush my plants,
I will put my light cycle back on 18 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: on and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that sounds crazy to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have given me negative
feedback and a lot of criticism about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that said I'm crazy and that
it's a fucked up idea have never tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the only feedback I've gotten from
people who do this is they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: my buds finished more quickly and they're
more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only getting negative feedback from
people who refuse to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who've tried it are liking the
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why am I doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is my goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my intention?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck was I thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the main source of energy for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am mostly making seeds in most of my
runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered that I can pollinate a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that pollination is successful,
I can put my light cycle back on 18-6 and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use my veg room as a veg room and I
don't have to continue flowering plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to make those seeds come to full
maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seeds will finish under a veg light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will reach full maturation
under that 18-6 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to grow flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to make seeds in this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turned my light cycle back to 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved other plants into that room so
that they could veg so I could have my
[SPEAKER_00]: next flower run ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, I let those seeds
harden up under 18 hours on and six off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did notice was my buds,
where the seeds would be, they looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not growing consumable, smokable
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was solely focused on seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turned my lights on to 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed my seeds were done a lot earlier
than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds took about 10 to 14 days,
less time to finish than they normally
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a better average of germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had thicker, fatter, better looking
seeds from using the 18 on and six off
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory behind this is that light is the
number one source of energy for my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can feed that plant more light,
it will photosynthesize more, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolize more, it will make bigger,
better, faster seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly what I achieved with
that idea, with that method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, since I'm doing this with my
seeds, couldn't I increase my light time a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit in my flower room and kind of
bang them out, make them a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: dense, get them out here a little bit
quicker?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to try this when I started
flushing, because we all know if we change
[SPEAKER_00]: the light cycle too early, you do run the
risk of re-vegging your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will happen if you let them go for
too long with this cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I don't do this until I am
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 10, maybe 12, maybe 14 days
before I'm going to cut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no re-veg opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones will not have that much time
to shift over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not happen that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do when I begin to flush,
I simply adjust my timer to 18 hours on,
[SPEAKER_00]: six hours off and flush my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pay close attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it gets really important
when the trichomes are ready, cut down the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay close attention because
they're not going to be ready at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: they were before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to finish sooner than they
did last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also going to be a little bit more
dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more weight to your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be more dense and it's
going to be done earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that is a great thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you do want the idea of
re-vegging that plant, you've already sped
[SPEAKER_00]: up your re-vegging process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're 10 to 14 days ahead of the game of
re-vegging that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut down the majority of the
plant, leave a couple of thumb sized
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets and re-veg those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already way ahead of the game
because you've been on a re-veg light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we have covered the three
main light schedules, which I would work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 12-12, we've got 11-13 and we've
got 18-6 for the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why I would do each
of those different cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-12, that's basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what most of my commercial rooms
run on when they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-12, that's going to work for almost
everything that we have bred, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been designed to put in an indoor
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about when I would use
11-on and 13-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11-on and 13-off is great, like I've said
before, for showing different
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was doing a phenohunt of a seed pack,
I may consider doing 11-on, 13-off in my
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle because I will see more
variation, more specific characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: of those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows the plants to express themselves
just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra hour of sleep lets them do
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one will get fox tail-y,
one will get a little bit finger-y,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one will turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what it may do,
but I see more variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm doing a phenohunt,
I may do that 11-on and 13-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were running something from DJ Short
with the blueberry in it, I may consider
[SPEAKER_00]: that 11-on, 13-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow responded very well to 11-on,
13-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of strains will like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains may not react as well,
but the only way to find that out is by
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the strain under that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do the first run when you grow
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would either do 12-12 or 11-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time you run a pack of seeds,
either do that 12-12 or 11-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both will be effective, but you may see
some differences in that 11-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we can't all change our
schedules, our rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one hour may mess something up for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one hour may throw everything else in
your schedule off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not be able to adjust timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that, but give it a run at
12-12 or 11-13 for the first time that you
[SPEAKER_00]: run a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about 18-6 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never recommend running 18 hours on and
16 hours off on the first try that you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow any plant ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to do that the second,
third, maybe fourth time that you've run
[SPEAKER_00]: this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it the first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first try, I always recommend doing
that 12-12 or 11-13 so we can see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant expresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll learn the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how long does it take to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I begin flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you know when to begin flushing,
the next couple of times you run it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can decide that is when I want to turn
that plant to 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that on the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know when to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 12-12 works always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial grows, I'll probably do 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feno hunts, I'm going to do 11 on,
13 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 18-6 comes in on that second or third
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that on the first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to learn these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will do the 18-6 and I will see how
the plants respond to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, some plants love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will not react well to it at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that naturally grow dense and they
get big, dense fat buds, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get more dense fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds that get a little bit larpy,
a little bit fluffy, they will tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: dense up and get a little bit harder and
pack on a little bit more weight toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the end if you use that 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great advantage of the 18-6 is I
think that they do finish a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: early when you run that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just metabolizing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're photosynthesizing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to speed up the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they do sleep, they go, hey,
I've only got a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some shit done so they speed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of why I recommend using that
18-6 light cycle, not on the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find out how long to flower
them on the first couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can play with the modified light
cycle at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me back up and actually answer the
main part of the question now that we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand these optional light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question was, which is quicker,
18-6 or 10-14?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to recap and I'm going to
go right back to where I started with all
[SPEAKER_00]: this and I'm going to say, that's probably
strain-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get different results from
each light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get sped up results from
both light cycles, but it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-specific on which works best for
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done 11-13 into 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that would be extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra hour going to the extra hours
would be crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always done 12-12 to 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe try 11-13 to 18-6 at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that does for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I'm not sure which light cycle
is faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could do the 10-14 and then switch
it to 18-6, you're going to see huge
[SPEAKER_00]: results there, but I have never done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be plant-specific,
strain-specific, cultivar, possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype-specific is going to be my
answer for that one.
