[SPEAKER_00]: My number right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My number, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took like a half gram snake dab a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been that kind of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there on microphone number four,
trolling me already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, honey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming back and joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for calling me and asking me to
come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, when I realized there was an open
mic, I was like, let's get Lindsay over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was super stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just picked up food and I was like,
nah, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to Jeff's.
[SPEAKER_00]: This joint is running like Usain Bolt if
you want to fix that when I pass it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so welcome to the podcast,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody listening, thank you for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that, I want to talk a
little bit about my weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I had a good friend
bless me with a front row ticket to reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never been front row reggae on
the rocks, that's a damn experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got to say, Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bought my first concert tickets to
Red Rocks today, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are we going to see?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see G-Eazy on the 22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm old and I'm a white guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea who that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you three make me laugh so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I were discussing earlier how
we're into way different music than a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's like 10 years older than everybody
he works with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the same age as Mike, 10 years older
than most people I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually get funny looks when I take over
the radio work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm used to it by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been happening for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's funny because I had a front
row ticket and the headlining band was
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's favorite band, which is 311.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess how much of 311 I stuck around for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the band that I wanted to see- I
probably did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into 311.
[SPEAKER_01]: They set it off at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of their favorite places to
play and it's one of the best venues in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the best venues in the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a spoiled brat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably seen 30 Red Rocks concerts
and that's no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 15 of them were widespread panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working that night and I caught a
couple of folks on Facebook and was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I wish I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chuckled because I remembered that you
would probably had just left the lot as
[SPEAKER_01]: those videos were being posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people that listen to the
podcast frequently know that my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae band currently, it will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my taste change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hear something that'll catch my
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Morgan Heritage has been my favorite
reggae band for a couple of few months
[SPEAKER_00]: here, probably the past year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played at 445.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to catch most of their set.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sounded fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played a bunch of new shit that I
didn't know, which was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wanted to hear some familiar
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hear your favorites,
but I also like seeing them They do kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a jam band thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start off with one song and they
don't stop till about halfway through
[SPEAKER_00]: their set and they just segue song to song
to song.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of did a medley.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite song by them,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on the mood I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, like not like this moment,
but I guess in this realm of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably throw on like Jaseed is one
of my favorite songs by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Strictly Roots is also a good
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a bunch of like remixes
that they do because they're a reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always yeah, they'll put out a
single all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Strictly Roots is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended and I was in the front row and
I looked back toward the sound booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking into the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see one of the band members hanging
out and I was like, oh, he's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm not going to go bug him,
but he's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I turned around and his brother,
Peter Morgan, was walking right past me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Peter Morgan is probably my favorite
reggae singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could sound like anybody,
if I could sing like a reggae artist,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd probably be Peter Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds really weird because
he's got a high pitched kind of voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of squeaky, but that dude can
fucking sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to, if I could sound like
anybody, probably be him, him or Richie
[SPEAKER_00]: Spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just the kind of reggae voice I
wish I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that dude walked right past me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just put my hand on his shoulder and
that dude is beefy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, when he touched some
people, they kind of move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude did not move.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is one stout fucking Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my hand on his shoulder and I was
like, bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just turned around and looked me
straight in my eyes and he stuck out his
[SPEAKER_00]: right hand and he shook my hand and he
said, respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he kept on walking because he
didn't want to get mobbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I would have stood there for
three seconds, he would have got crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just kept on moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet pretty much my favorite
reggae singer at Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he walked by, time went on and then
Steel Pulse came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steel Pulse might be my number two
favorite reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great seeing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting a joint, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steel Pulse was great, but they were a
little slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything just seemed a touch slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting fucking old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the dreadlocks are super gray in
Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dreads are getting gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really long, but they're getting
gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my anonymous friend who
got me up front row there at Reggae on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band after that was Iration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to about a song and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, let's get the fuck
out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iration was not entertaining me one bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like Iration, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Roots Reagan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggae that Iration was not doing it for
me that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left and I drove to the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Adam Hill for
hosting the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Hill was in a really good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet Adam's wife for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She follows me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: We follow each other on all the social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was cool to finally shake her hand
and give her a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Adam's wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bumped into Lindsay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into the Devin Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a Bobo Blaster Co there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw Brett for a brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're ever able to go to a
Secret Sesh in Denver, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you get on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you go do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come take some dabs with Lindsay,
myself, the Devin Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Max for that big ass dab you
gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Max for every time that we
see him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I see him, he is so take
this dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some bacon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicated bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes medicated bacon and you see
people grubbing it at the event and they
[SPEAKER_00]: look satisfied, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you medicate bacon?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I can't speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think his is in the crust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sugar glaze.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, yeah, he puts like a cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I could be wrong on that really.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never eaten it because I'm a
vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume you have to like,
because I mean, cooking it in the oil
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't do enough because you wouldn't be
able to tell the dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real crispy and it's coated in
something because he handed me some and
[SPEAKER_00]: gave it to me, but I just gave it to Bobo
Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't eat bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I told him that I'm a vegetarian,
he kind of looked at me and he felt bad
[SPEAKER_00]: that he had been offering me bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt like legitimately guilty,
like, fuck, I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, it's cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes here, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me a big ass dab, like a
really, like a manly sized dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I told him I took it all in one
chunk, I'm good on that little one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we just smoke?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was space cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had a good flavor, a good smooth
burn, nice white ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me about that company and
that packaging?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from Altitude Organic Medicine and
the Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Altitude.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is pretty convenient for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of lazy when it gets to rolling
joints sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude showed up with two packages
of pre-rolled joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the weed was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got stoned from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little leery about some places where
I buy pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they're kind of suspect,
but these guys, they, uh, they come
[SPEAKER_00]: through every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of their managers is a very good
friend of mine and I trust that place
[SPEAKER_00]: because of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cause I know she wouldn't represent a
place that wasn't, uh, wasn't worth
[SPEAKER_00]: representing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got too big of a heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude showed up with packages of
pre-rolled joints of quality joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, you know, I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of more companies aren't
pre-packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that it says Sativa and Indica on
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys over at Altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first place I saw that was a place
called Pride in Medicine in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they fell off and all the new rules
came.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of different places doing
something similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I like the way that this project
turned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Willie Nelson strand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a chance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a chance to try just about every
product out there on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to travel the whole state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I'm a sucker for name brand and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've tried to Snoop Dogg,
but Willie, I gotta give a shout out to
[SPEAKER_06]: him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the, his model.
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually grows his weed in house,
you know, unlike like Snoop he just come
[SPEAKER_06]: to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He puts his name on something.
[SPEAKER_06]: He puts his name on the strand he likes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Willie actually, this is his company.
[SPEAKER_06]: He grew it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went to Lucy's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky in Denver and they had a little room
set up, had guitars, albums where he
[SPEAKER_06]: signed all kinds of merch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then his, his, uh, joint packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that a recreational or a medical
place?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody that's coming from out of
state, make sure you check out,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's it called again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Willie's reserve, uh, the dispensary
Lucy's sky, Lucy's sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can check out Willie's reserve
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a dispensary where they got some
Willie Nelson memorabilia and merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go check that out myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of for show, but the,
the, the get is the, is the.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got, he's got concentrates and
edibles too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't tried those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just tried a couple of pre-rolled
joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just seen the packaging, the patching
packaging looked intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the new packaging is intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tube and then you pull it out and
then it's got another pre-roll tube in
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Russian doll trying to buy
cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, what did you just bust out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just threw some, some snacks here on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got for us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, um, uh, this is the incredibles monkey
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical dose, the medical dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are 20 each square is 20
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move these right out of my
reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you more than Terps, but I haven't
eaten edibles since my experience at the
[SPEAKER_00]: secret session.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I keep trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm, I'm kind of trying,
I'm trying to see how long I can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bring you a lower dosage every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, it's, it's, uh, once I get on a
streak, I'm really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to stay on a streak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm on a streak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got five milligrams in the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: A streak and no edibles whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whenever I pick a streak,
whatever I'm doing, I'm really stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I commit to something, then I just
like, once I made it like a week or two
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've broken the desire or whatever,
then I'm like, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just see how long I can go on
whatever I'm doing here, whether it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: eating meat, which has been 20 something
years now or not brushing my hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been almost 12 years or,
you know, just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't miss either one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't miss either one of the brushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a bald guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his head shaved nice and close
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get almost, you can almost brush
your beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be on the show more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to make your no edible street fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even showed up with edibles this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of high end chocolates
that we just got into the shop that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come in a sample pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought the sample for us to play
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that got me those Reggae on the
Rocks tickets, that might be her favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: edible that you brought there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tiramisu one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bunch of people ask me for,
and that's the one I plan on trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know how I act for lemon G dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how she gets for those Tiramisu
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The packaging is impressive as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're totally compliant with the new
rules too, which I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff, even that I'm
getting samples of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when they rolled out, I think they
knew that that was coming and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: went with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried one yet, but so far
packaging and presentation is a home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember back in the day when we had a
dispensary and the packaging was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these Ziploc bags with the product
name hand written on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few places still that sell weed
in bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would get the owner's owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the owners would walk in with a
laundry or not, you know, like the sweater
[SPEAKER_01]: storage bin, the big plastic bin for like
under the bed was one of those Tupperware
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that a lot of people make it
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cloner out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be full of like slices of
banana bread, individually wrapped in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ziploc bags with just a piece of Scotch
tape, taping the flap down so it fit
[SPEAKER_01]: taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what went onto our shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know where they stayed when we
closed at the end of the night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there on that shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing got put away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were never there longer than like
three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of me is glad we've advanced to where
we are now because it's a good thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: the health department is overseeing edible
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never pictured something like the
product I'm holding in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even three years ago, let alone
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like something that you would get
from a really fine chocolate company
[SPEAKER_00]: through the mail or something like I
figured.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard a rumor about the company that
they got some exotic friendship,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that, you know, that that's probably
just somebody making it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's deaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've definitely got a high-end
chocolatier working for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are impressive as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've paid a lot of money to give these to
girlfriends throughout my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just non-medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've paid the same amount for these that I
paid for unmedicated chocolates more than
[SPEAKER_01]: one holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we're hyping them up,
let's give them a quick shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't pay for any advertising,
but they seem to be the talk of the show
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of seconds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Koda Signature Truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Koda Signature Truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're packaged very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a black box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a condom package.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get three different flits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a fancy condom box is what
it makes me think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had more than one person describe it
as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the logo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the logo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of rubberish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes a circle and it, yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to, I'm not going to get
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had heard about these long before I
actually got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see them in person and one,
they were at the shop today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to grab a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as I'm eating one night and talking
about them enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're the tastiest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably one I've tried on the market
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay just threw a medium sized dab at
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to take this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much?
[SPEAKER_01]: The show slows down for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just know that we're getting higher for
your entertainment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are six pieces in that package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys dive in if you want one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavors are kind of listed on the box
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are six of them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many milligrams is each piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: Each piece is 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get six per box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys can really dive in and try a
couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought you the baby step bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the starter step bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to infuse your lunch one
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep thinking that until I infuse your
lunch one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can infuse it with some acid or some
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does that package cost if you're
not an employee at the dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a snobby asshole are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're surprised I haven't learned yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You caught me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the one item on my shelf I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that in one paper pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the one item that you don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a price range?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a price range?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worth it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a dude and you were in trouble
and your girlfriend's a pothead and you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought those home to your girlfriend,
you'd probably be fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your shoe would be okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: She might think you've done something
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you got to save it until you've
already done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait until she already knows when
you're in the dog house already and then
[SPEAKER_00]: show up with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not a regular gift bringer,
I screwed up good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't call my mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your wife call your mom when you
fucked up?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff was really concerned for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I left the house, my mom called my
wife, which it's weird that we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about that now on the show, but these are
delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: To switch, just so you know, girls do do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call their significant other's
mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 30s and 40s to tattle, and get them in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom would just laugh and hang up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
Click.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we did come together for an
actual podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about dads and
chocolates and all that shit for this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just brought fun snacks and got carried
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much Mike called me semi-early
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Mike and I, it might've been early.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most of you folks, it was probably
well into your day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking to myself,
I bet you this conversation happened at
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still had an AM attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an AM involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike sent me a message and he's like,
hey, this is what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reporter is looking for somebody to
talk to because there's this new story
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, would you like to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: About two seconds later, my phone blew up
with a whole bunch of other people asking
[SPEAKER_00]: me, would you like to speak for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to speak for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm well-spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm well-known amongst the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They felt that I'd be a good
representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the people that messaged
me and wanted me to contact this reporter
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed the baton over to our buddy,
Mike, because I don't want to be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: news talking about that I grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let Mike do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's well-spoken and eloquent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason caregivers don't do
interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Berkowitz effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to name it on the show,
but yeah, it's legitimately the Berkowitz
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one and only caregiver in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: To really do an interview, paid for it
severely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, is still paying for it in many very
real ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Pueblo, that means that we had no
caregiver advocates down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For lack of a better candidate,
that became me a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fight that I care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caregivers have been part of Colorado for
more than a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never been part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say we in a very general term because I
am not a caregiver, but they're very much
[SPEAKER_01]: under attack again right now in Colorado
from a number of different angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going after the doctors right now
and looking at plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every county is restricting the number of
plants you can grow in a home or looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to limit the size and scope of your garden
in one way or another if it's not by plant
[SPEAKER_01]: count directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rough time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I predicted a couple years back that
caregiving wouldn't be a thing by 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this happen in Springs less than a
year ago, and now that's basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: same rules they're trying to implement
that they did in Springs are trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already done it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on right now is our Board of
County Commissioners is talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: putting a question on the vote this
November on the ballot that says,
[SPEAKER_01]: should we go to the state and continue to
lobby for a statewide cap of 18 plants per
[SPEAKER_01]: household?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a medical recommendation
from your doctor to grow an increased
[SPEAKER_00]: plant count of, say, 60 plants,
then fuck your medical card, fuck your
[SPEAKER_00]: needs, fuck your condition, you're limited
by this new rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new rules that they're talking about
wouldn't affect the card that you get
[SPEAKER_01]: written.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just affect your ability to grow
on that card.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be limited to that number of plants
unless you had a specific type of
[SPEAKER_01]: property, which I haven't seen defined
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not in a house or a residence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of what caregivers are and what
the other rules around caregiving are in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, that means you can't be a
caregiver and have more than 18 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're a caregiver,
you can't have a storefront or a building
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do it out of your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, these new rules for statewide
means no more caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your extended plant count card could still
exist and you'd just be assigning that
[SPEAKER_01]: extended plant count to your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which feels like is what they're trying to
do with most of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to take away the caregiver
and send it all to a dispensary so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can make some tax money off of it and not
worry about what's actually needing to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the goal statewide for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caregivers have been the scapegoat for all
continued black market activity in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado for the last eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime a homegrown gets busted,
they're like, oh my God, these medical
[SPEAKER_01]: rules are so confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go back and reread the article in the
paper and there was no paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a caregiver that was breaking
the rules or manipulating the rules or
[SPEAKER_01]: hiding under the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a black market grower that's
been here for forever doing what they've
[SPEAKER_01]: always done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's different is that
caregivers also exist in the same state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But caregivers are the public face of home
growing and so they take all that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, the state has gotten a
taste of recreational taxes and they've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a real look at the sales totals by
volume and the med market's still eating
[SPEAKER_01]: up half of what Colorado period is
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would love to tax that at the higher
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical's kind of under attack under all
fronts right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why I'm telling people to
register to vote for eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that you can clear up for a lot
of Colorado folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in Colorado have this thing that
they think that since as an adult,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're allowed to grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get their basic six plant medical
marijuana card, are you allowed to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: your six plus your six or are you just
limited at the original six?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on where you're living.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is confusing as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, really, really, really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here in Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_01]: It matters city to county.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city doesn't care what your plant
count is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked incredibly hard for a very long
time to make sure that the city of Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: did not implement a plant count limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found sympathetic ears inside city
government and myself and a caregiver here
[SPEAKER_01]: in town who isn't willing to go on the
news but is willing to work with city
[SPEAKER_01]: government people managed to get them to
hear reason and not do a plant count
[SPEAKER_01]: limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did a square footage limit and
require air filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't get them to hear reason on a
number of other rules they implemented
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't support nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the county, they've already passed
an 18 plant count limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means if you live in Pueblo County
versus city, you're limited 18 plants
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in a residential area,
there are some exceptions to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll have to look up your specific
zoning, your residence, and then what the
[SPEAKER_01]: specific rules are for that zoning
designation before I could give you a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: answer on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You answered my question because somebody
came into the dispensary the other day and
[SPEAKER_04]: told me that Pueblo was an 18 count
county.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, look it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I'm not going to look it
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to call Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that fight and there was not
much public support against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caregivers are really busy people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state put the squeeze on them several
years ago with a couple of statewide
[SPEAKER_01]: limitations that mean in practice,
caregivers don't have a lot of free time
[SPEAKER_01]: to lobby city councils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they do, they tend to get treated
pretty badly because they're there for one
[SPEAKER_01]: specific reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have six months to learn how to
play the insane game you're required to
[SPEAKER_01]: play to do things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often unfortunate that the system
works that way, but that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so caregivers have had a rough go of
it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like one, maybe two more
elections, and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's in our history books.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can really do, if you're a part
of the vote, make sure that you wait for
[SPEAKER_00]: this to come up on the ballot and you do
not allow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that you wait for
this to come up on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that you wait for
this to come up on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that you wait for
a longer time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like 64 plants is not like cartel
numbers kicking out a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people, when they see something
like 99 plants is the state limit,
[SPEAKER_01]: they picture the plants they've seen in
the newspaper that are the size of a
[SPEAKER_01]: Volkswagen bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They picture 99 of those suckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just don't realize that
immediately the numbers cut in half
[SPEAKER_01]: because only half of those plants can be
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about a caregiver with
that's growing 99 plants, it's often
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're caregivers for five
patients, often five patients and then
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each patient requires two or three
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each strain requires one or two moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start dividing out over life
cycles in two different rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden, you're you're struggling
to stay under 99 and you're barely
[SPEAKER_01]: producing enough marijuana for just your
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to run a seed pack to find
something new, then you're really already
[SPEAKER_00]: over numbers as soon as you pop those 10
and get them planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it gets very complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when your number six, it's it's almost
impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you're you're basically left with
plant a seed, pray it's female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe keep one and rotate five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it gets very complicated quickly
and it's not productive and it doesn't do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to combat the things that people
that are writing these rules are hoping it
[SPEAKER_01]: will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to do anything to the
illegal growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to do anything to the smell
of marijuana in neighborhoods from shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: grows with no carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to make life a lot harder
for patients who rely on caregivers for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine at a price they can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to force them to go to a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to force them to maybe find a
ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they don't have money because I
know that what if you've got a caregiver,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you are reimbursing your caregiver
compared to what you are paying at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary is a huge, huge, drastic
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is massive, almost 50
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the I mean, just the cost to the
patient is 50 percent at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's here's something that we should
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I've been your caregiver for how
long now since probably 2010 ish give or
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So six or seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your cannabis needs very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think I've watched you evolve
into a little dabber lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of neat to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a time saver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can name straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what strains you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know if I walked into my garden,
I'd be like, I got to throw a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: these into the room for Mike because he's
going to need this in about 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get this ready for him.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay's a budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a very good budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much do you know about Mike's
cannabis needs right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my defense, Mike's never come in the
shop before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, Mike and I have dabbed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming actually that you need
Indica's variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Kush Tonic one of your strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush Tonic is one of my favorite greening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't know what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I mess with it in the daytime,
I'm not going to get a thing done.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's exactly what I need it to do
for me in the evenings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were wondering caregivers are
important, damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my point is that I know what Mike
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got flowers pretty much prepared when
Mike needs them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like, oh, should I better put that
into flower soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Mike got this from me a little bit
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means pretty soon his jar is going to
be empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be like, where's my great
purple dog, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to need to have some of that
ready for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no offense to you, you're not supposed
to know that, but you don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the, you're going to be the one
providing his cannabis if they eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: me from the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have to learn all of
these people that do not have a caregiver
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to try to learn their
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to try to have that
product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the grow at Green and Healthy Wellness
supply those flowers that Mike needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the juicy needs that I need, that you
need, that the people in that room need,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in that house over there need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we fucking supply those specific
flowers like a caregiver can?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because they don't have that many
mother plants and they don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part of the equation that really
worries me isn't really the part that
[SPEAKER_01]: affects me directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people that use the caregiver
system in Colorado are consuming massive
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of THC concentrated oil and CBD
concentrated oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the medical or the rec market,
this is going to cost them hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars a day per dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you price it out recreational,
several hundred dollars a day per dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: two doses a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're looking at 12, 1300 per day in
medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the caregiver market with the plant
counts that are under attack right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting that same dose at the same
quality, if not better, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: production and a far cheaper dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheaper price, pennies on the dollar
because of how it's produced and where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't need the million dollar
machine, the two million dollar building,
[SPEAKER_01]: the a hundred thousand dollars in permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they don't have to pass that on to
the epilepsy patients and to the cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that are taking a thousand
milligrams of CBD twice a day or a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand milligrams of THC twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a caregiver give me a bottle that
was I think 648 milligrams of pure THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that cost me at a recreational
dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many milligrams?
[SPEAKER_00]: 648.
[SPEAKER_06]: 80, 90 bucks probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, way more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rec you're looking at around 60 to 90 a
gram for good like CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was pure CBD tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure CBD tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little MCT oil and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you're still looking at maybe 300
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We exchanged a 10 pack of seeds for that
tincture because it was a caregiver to
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver transaction for a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean recreationally that would have cost
a fortune.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a hundred and sixty milligrams you're
looking at I mean like 60 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure he would have given it
to me if I didn't even offer him the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: pack in exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you get something,
you know, like there was stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get stuff for my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the caregiver system is where the
people that really, really need the high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality high dose medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they get their, their,
their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have to, I can deal with the
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got access to enough cannabis product
selection to keep myself on my feet and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy enough to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of people who can't
say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado that rely on caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I don't mind standing up
and doing press or advocacy for
[SPEAKER_01]: caregivers, even though I'm not one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure a lot of people just don't
want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it's more out in the open than
it used to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people don't want to be seen
walking in to a dispensary to purchase
[SPEAKER_06]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still very much a stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still very much lose your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the porn shop for some people
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why'd you look me like that lens?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing as walking into the
porn shop for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't be seen doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hope somebody sees me walking in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The porn shop or the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they stalked you and watched you go to
both know that you're going to go home and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a great day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to the porn shop and buy your
wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a stigma attached for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still run into it regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run into customers who are from other
states who are like, I can't use the ATM
[SPEAKER_01]: in this building because my bank might
know that this address is where I possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: might use the ATM in a big hot store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a handful a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in large parts of the rest of the
country doing what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're talking about at this table
will lay your ass in jail for an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly long period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These delicious chocolates we were just
eating are a serious felony in some parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're made with concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pass that felony over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass me that felony.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did 45 days in jail over a pack of
rolling papers one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: In what state?
[SPEAKER_06]: North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rolling papers?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: No weed, just rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great way to segue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't even say you like rolled your
own cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I said I used it for my underwear so
I didn't get shit stained in my underwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a little more into the mic for
that because that was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to make sure we get this
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say it again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told the cop, I said, well, I use those
for shit so I don't get shit stains in my
[SPEAKER_06]: underwear, cramming up my asshole.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it still didn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said in court too, by the way,
it was just really embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me 45 days in jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 45 days of my life was taken away
because of a pack of rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember those days though, when I was
in band in like seventh grade,
[SPEAKER_01]: they told us to buy rolling papers for
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember what about the
instruments, but the paper specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: was good for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something with a read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could wrap your read in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's how little I pay attention
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember the speech in class,
they're like, all right, what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying now is currently contraband.
[SPEAKER_01]: If law enforcement contacts you about
these, you can explain that it's for your
[SPEAKER_01]: instrument and that hopefully you don't
get a ticket for having what we're telling
[SPEAKER_01]: you to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like 20 years ago and there's
still places in the country that are like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two years ago, I was, you know,
a little over two years now, but two years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago I was in that hell, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was, and I went back about a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a paranoid feeling here now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: When a cop gets behind me, I could care
less.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got weed on me so fuck it what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a medical card too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But back home, I mean, you know,
I was that paranoid feeling came back and
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your chest backs, your heart pounds a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palms gets sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I starts twitching a little bit in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, fuck, I'm going to jail,
going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what brought you to Colorado from North
Carolina?
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here is not that feeling,
not having that, not having that fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you came on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you work as a courier for a
company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work for Stratos.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's we make, uh, THC pills.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, we do medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, uh, probably the highest dose CBD
probably on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you say, um, 15 to ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just drop these straight into your
drink and it dissolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the brand new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, we don't have the,
the, the brand new ascent on our shelves
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the Stratos pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a brand new product on the market
last what, six months?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, they've been in business for
about a year, but they, uh, they exploded
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere across the state about six
months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I really like them personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, uh, they're a great low dose
medication option.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're CBD products are really
convenient and they're available
[SPEAKER_00]: recreationally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreationally a hundred milligrams and
medically up to 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have three different kinds.
[SPEAKER_06]: The relax is like a, it's a hybrid,
the energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have also one asleep that I
don't have because I'm not trying to go to
[SPEAKER_06]: sleep right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sleep that's for going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people swear by the bartenders
seem to the sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get more feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just a real heavily activated THCA?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes a lot of good sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are sins.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting here and he just medicated a
Snapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched him drop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sample and shake it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what'd you got in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, THC, we discussed
medicating my Mountain Dew and decided
[SPEAKER_01]: that was not safe around all this
electrical equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may fizz up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I understand, you can medicate
any beverage, any beverage, no flavor to
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it, um, it works like a kind of
Alka-Sesser.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'll look at them, they kind of look
like Alka-Sesser feels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it'll, it'll fizz up and there
is kind of a taste in like a carbonated
[SPEAKER_06]: beverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can taste it, but like in this tea and
I've tried it in juice as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not really a real mild flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, a lot of drinks have a heavy
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an option that I can, a medicate
whatever beverage I want without adding
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture, which is always a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do like the sodas, but you can taste
that medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're also kind of weedy
tasting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, you know, I like my edible,
like these codas right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have that weedy taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to eat the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to get that THC in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get yoga in your chair over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's going on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just laughing because I was
halfway through it and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: damn, Jeff's going to call me out on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, man, Brett really had it right
in the last one when he did like the
[SPEAKER_04]: stretches in the middle of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like shout out to you, Brett.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kills it on Facebook, Brett or on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett posts the greatest shit on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Eva labs, uh, at Mary's,
you know, he has a fake, so make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the right one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary's motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the correct Mary's
motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he's only got two posts, it's the fake
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't follow him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should know how to spell motivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're a courier and you get to go to
probably almost half of the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great variety, medical and recreationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that makes me real jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gorgeous state and, uh,
I would love to spend part of my day every
[SPEAKER_01]: day driving around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a while, keep in mind it's
September now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in a couple of weeks, that's going
to turn into an extreme sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have to drive across the fucking
state every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no fun in the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, like independent pass is
open right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but they shut that down during the
winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your social media feeds or the photos are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we did an episode, you're a
podcast listener, so you probably listened
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the craziest shit that
people have seen in a dispensary going to
[SPEAKER_00]: all these dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen something crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what do you mean crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something that stands out something
that you'd want to share with the bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that listen on a podcast,
anything you've seen either at a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary or at like a smoke lounge or a
smoke event, whatever craziness you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen at an industry event or facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me, give me a minute to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's a few things I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you light that joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's lightened up one of V he's got these
sativas from altitude organic medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: premium can of cones, five high grade
cones says there may be health risks
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cancer and you'll have a smile on
your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: This strain is ed Rose super.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the ed Rosenthal super bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew a dude that grew that for several
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the, looking, I'm at the
end of the table guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking down the table and I see
at least eight mainstream cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean different companies,
products, vastly different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just this afternoon I was reading an
article that was saying Colorado doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have real legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it hurts there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that are going to vote
against legalization this November,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, because they're worried they won't
make enough money when their state ends up
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly like Colorado is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe you to vote to risk going
to jail and keeping it the way it is
[SPEAKER_01]: because of something silly like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a lot of scared people that
are afraid of change in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: People hate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was a black market grower for far
too long and it's much more comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: having shifted to having this badge around
my neck all the time and knowing that what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing is not shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm actually doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch me all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm doing is where I was so
much easier that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do run a bit, but they hit pretty
nice for a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they probably just pack a bunch of
cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've made 900 pre-rolls in a shift
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have few pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say that we got a
monkey, a monkey in the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's been that monkey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I also make sure that sure that
they roll and burn a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're a judgemental crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one can do to commute,
can do a bit little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call the first one Usain Bolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first one could have been the
Olympics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was running so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just kind of, so yeah,
sorry altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't mean to just completely bash
your pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, I've sold worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rolled worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely rolled worse too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best is when you're at a concert and
you're like, I'm going to fire up this
[SPEAKER_00]: joint and you light it and it's just
fucking running.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to light the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that part falls apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this one just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a guy next to you go from
excited to disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I couldn't smoke any weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The front row at Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only bad part about the price
you pay for the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go for a little walk and sneak off by
the trees and smoke you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shook the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Reggae on the Rocks, I asked a couple
of people, I was like, how's the check?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, they're just going
to patch you down and they let you
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost got the gloves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were taking shit from fucking
everybody at Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were cool about it because they'd
pull your pipe out or pull whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't find my shit, but they'd pull
it out and they'd be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you the option to take this to
your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not bringing this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you come back, if I find this on
you again, we have to call the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're turning you into the police and
like in the camera right there and the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera right there just saw you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't fucking do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the pass at least as long as
you're chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one little chick was like,
take the pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure the one security guard
lady was a prison guard by day or a prison
[SPEAKER_00]: guard by night and a Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stopped fucking around at concert
venues a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, arms up, take your sweater off
your waist, take your hat off.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'm going to touch you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to touch you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to touch you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to check by your dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I grab it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much how they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a couple of people got injured.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some rocks fell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Climbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right before that, they'd really
started looking at security and making
[SPEAKER_01]: some improvements inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a completely different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first Red Rocks show, I think was Fish
in 95, 69, 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw Fish there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was basically a big... Hard to
judge a venue's security from the night
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I climbed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a giant dirt field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a giant dirt and cactus and fucking
brush fire waiting to happen type of
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we were a hippie wearing sandals,
it was just a big toe fucking damaging
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Red Rocks when I was a teenager
and it wasn't just a concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still slightly an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into uphill, if you got weak
legs and shitty lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be ready to hike in the heat and then
throw that water bottle away before you
[SPEAKER_01]: enter the venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of challenged myself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm just going to do this
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can control my breathing quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got fucking these climber legs
because I'm so tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of leverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just go up that hill all day
fucking long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just go prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in fitter in shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that I'm going to get my ass
whipped a little bit before I get to my
[SPEAKER_01]: seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shorts, a t-shirt, a long sleeve shirt,
a rain poncho, a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent five hours on those stone steps
waiting for the doors to open one day like
[SPEAKER_01]: bacon in the summer sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that once waiting for Fish in 95,
but I ate so much acid that I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fucking floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now Red Rocks looks like a state park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all cemented everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the parking is now cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it used to be in 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 96, I snuck over the back of the stage
and watched the Allman Brothers Band from
[SPEAKER_00]: the rocks behind the stage for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year I saw somebody up there and I'm
99% sure security fucking climbed up there
[SPEAKER_00]: and arrested those motherfuckers and they
got like a $10,000 ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't do that shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Rocks has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost got the glove out and I was
waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, so you're going to get the
glove or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you didn't find what you're looking
for yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got gloves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull it out of your pocket for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what you need, lady?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a blue glove.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the black pH gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long and strange show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you think of a crazy dispensary story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to put them on the spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking it would just come.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking it would just come to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was listening to you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're talking about Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, have you been to Red Rocks yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to hit a concert there this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only concerts I've been in Colorado is
the little ones they've had up in the
[SPEAKER_06]: little dab bars up in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever been to one of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been to the concerts there,
but I've been to the plenty of the dab
[SPEAKER_00]: bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually, I've got tickets to see,
uh, Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold at the dab
[SPEAKER_00]: lounge this Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time this podcast airs,
I think I will have seen that show and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you should have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at the dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're recording tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the show's at seven 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your tickets on a friend of
mine's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link you up with them or just go to
the dab line, just Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a link tickets are like five
bucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Christian Butte
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like seven bucks at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to spend too much
money and that's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm off tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a comedian named Jeff Tate and his
friend, Emma Arnold, and they are doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: show called good cop, bad cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your microphone is getting all limpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to fix it, but I need a
screwdriver to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean for it to do that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never done that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I can't perform for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor mic stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all embarrassed now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strangest dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably have this actually happened in
town.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to say the name of it,
but it, it's ghetto.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is ghetto.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a, well, I'll probably give it away
right here, but there's a laundromat
[SPEAKER_06]: beside it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we go two weeks ago, we go birthday
joint shopping because it was my friend's
[SPEAKER_06]: birthday and she was, you know,
some places give you birthday joints for
[SPEAKER_06]: coming in and shopping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it soul's birthday?
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if you listen to the
podcast or not, but happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was her birthday and we went to this
place and start walking up and this guy
[SPEAKER_06]: comes from out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul said he come out of the, the
laundromat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but he just kind of popped
up on us and it just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nobody in the dispensary,
but him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't know anything about any of the
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, so, you know, I asked him,
they had some of our product and I said,
[SPEAKER_06]: what do you know about these are here?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't take bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the worst salesman I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hard to sell a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you come in there for one reason,
not hard to sell a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can confirm the shit out of that,
but he could, he couldn't, he couldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: have sold me ice water if I was thirsty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he was awful.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, that's just the most recent
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I'll come up with another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did he even have a badge around his neck?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I didn't even look for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have left with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just snatched his badge, my badge of
honor, like 50 cent taking someone's
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just smoked the blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't, I don't hit blunts very
often and I just took a hit off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: blunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a very rare picture on my
phone of Jeffrey hitting a, a backwood,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big sloppy, drooly funky bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God he was like moving in the
picture and it's blurry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you can clearly see the backwood.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can clearly see it's him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I was trying so hard, so fast to
get it because he was like trying to hit
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigfoot accounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my boy, Adam ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Adam ill is a sponsored by
backwoods and he smokes a lot of backwoods
[SPEAKER_00]: and he rolled up a big old bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those nasty cigar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he licks them like he licks it up like
his school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like it's the video the other day
that was like, um, uh, he said something
[SPEAKER_04]: that was like extra saliva or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: My grandpa, he used to chew them things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much what Adam does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He chews the end of it while he's smoking
on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he would break a piece off and chew it
in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grandpa's a damn man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a stomach ache thinking
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't even going to cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your grandpa's a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when men were men and the life
expectancy was like 46.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chew the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I've, I've met people that did
that before that either just nod directly
[SPEAKER_01]: on a backwood or use that as chewing
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met people that, uh, I don't know how
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up in tobacco farmland.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from the tar hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that was kind of normal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: He, I'm sure he grew, he raised tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mama sit there telling me how she used
to pick it when she was five years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just felt so bad for her cause this is
some rough work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I'm sure he's probably just do a
whole leap in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty rugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get really lit up when I smoke a blunt,
something about that tobacco leaf just
[SPEAKER_00]: really makes me spin around and get some,
you don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely even smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly just dabs is my world lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when I was a rare night.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just hit everything that's been passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to be polite, try to have some fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going for any of the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to politely avoid all of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cool kids are doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm highly offended that you're not eating
any of the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're finally getting peer pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just ran and there's somebody,
there's people in the house that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they were offered some of the
strato, they just took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that, it's over here where you
can reach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you gotta do is come eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ain't gonna peer pressure you though.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could get my company to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for real.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to put that in a drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, I think that's a winner,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: These won the cannabis cup this year,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dakota's did.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, if you guys want any of these,
I've got all the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dive in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't play around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, Sample, I literally- I'm off
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many more?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, I had to stop at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the day off and I had to stop at
work for something and I'd had people ask
[SPEAKER_01]: me for or ask me if we carried them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just grabbed both kinds that we
carried and brought them for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dive in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you try that monkey bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet, but it's on the do list.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say this at all,
but that monkey bar from Incredibles is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my very favorite edibles that's
ever been made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll leave a piece here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of edibles in my- How much
did you eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this is why I don't do edibles
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've hit this twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a 12 hour period, I consumed over
2,500 milligrams of edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you don't have to say anything
else, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I'm just taking a break.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't go over like 30 or 40.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, because you know- Well,
like six or 700 was hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when I was going in and then I
did a thousand- Dude, I'm on the floor,
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on the floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to completely stay still because if
I even move my head a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm roughing right into a- See,
I go real light with edibles to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, I don't really feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes symptom management significantly
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like about the Stratos
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other stuff, 25, 30 milligrams is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any more than that, and I'm not fun in
public high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,500, I'd be toasted for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up still high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still high when I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes, I'm wearing my iRegenetics logo
shirt, and this red print is dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark red.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes were that red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's for you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel free to- You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I might- Let's see, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want to- Drop a THC in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I already went one.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I like to eat- I want to watch it
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like- So you can see the
bubbles?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want y'all to see the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like Alka-Seltzer kind of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you described it as?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'll pass those to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to watch this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to eat the smallest physical thing
with the highest milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those- Oh, it's very similar to
Alka-Seltzer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those small gummies, the one gummies that
are 100 milligrams or that one piece of
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate, not a bar, a piece of chocolate
that's 100 milligram, that's me all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't want to eat a whole bar
and get 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to eat 100 milligrams real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the exact opposite thing about the
five milligram gummies because I can sit
[SPEAKER_01]: there and pop six of them and have that is
like, I'm going to get really toasted
[SPEAKER_01]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually get to chew and enjoy the
edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my gripe about edibles is they're
delicious, but now they're the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: your thumb joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take one tiny little brownie bite
and I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take a tiny bite of a brownie,
most of the rest of my body that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: chewing in that moment starts looking for
more of that fucking brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when all of the brownie has wheat in
it, that can get dangerous fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's why I like the lower dose
stuff because I can have a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces and enjoy it because most of them
are insanely good now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a new idea for an edible company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sell, let's just copy our favorite
edibles and we'll sell those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right alongside those,
we'll sell the same thing without any THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been joking about it for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first company that does it well is
going to make a nice- So that you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: eat these and then snack the shit out of
these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there a documentary about one
company that did that already that didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: have a lot of- I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. J's or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more than one company that does a
larger piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't do it in a multi-pack
successfully.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to make like a dozen of cookies,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to have one packaged in the
front of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one is a hundred milligrams and
the rest are none.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you eat the one and then you can eat
the rest of them and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you shuffle them and set them on the
table when company comes over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he's not eating edibles for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see somebody at the secret session
handed me an edible and I passed it on and
[SPEAKER_00]: they looked completely offended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, sorry, I'm on a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just looked at me like,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why'd you give it away?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're giving it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like right in front of Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you give it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed it and I was like, Oh no,
wait, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing those drugs anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try and get you to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I'm, I'm just stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a joke to me now that I
haven't done eating any edible since that
[SPEAKER_00]: time at secret session when I ate like
2,500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tried to go to work and I was
just fucking always eat too many edibles
[SPEAKER_04]: at secret session.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I swear to God, every time we have the
conversation, like we're not going to eat
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like the last two times you
followed through on that, obviously the
[SPEAKER_04]: last two times I have not, it was nine 30
at secret session.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, uh, Bobo blaster code.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris bought me a cookie and I was going
to, I was going to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like eating the cookie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like nine, like nine 39.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to open the shop the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy was like, I'm eating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, yeah, these cookies were
like 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's what I've been telling
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, but realistically they might be
like four or I was like, I'm three fourths
[SPEAKER_04]: the weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm going to finish it now
because like it doesn't matter now,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like, man, I wish I would've known
that before I started eating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I would've only eaten a quarter or
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I like about the rec
market over the med and there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: on that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the, the, the dosing and the lab
testing, the perfection it's coming to the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical scene very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be there in, um, less than a year
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I heard November, I, it was
supposed to be July and then they said
[SPEAKER_00]: November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to build the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing, we're creating this from
the ground up, which is like why we're
[SPEAKER_01]: joking about like different models for
edible companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if we're really watching it happen in
front of us, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the honor of, uh, giving Lindsey and
her better half, uh, Mr. Bobo Blaster Co a
[SPEAKER_00]: ride home from the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew you were going to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little nappy head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back of the car there was that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, that cookie killed me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second of all, it was the cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff wanted to do a podcast on the way
home and I was totally down to do a
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we were all smoking and I guess I
had said that I was going to wait to do a
[SPEAKER_04]: dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've said, no, I don't want to do a
dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Chris thought I said that I was going
to wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently we're all waiting for me to
take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fell asleep in the back of the car and
then I woke up and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: all right, I'm going to keep eating so
that I will stay awake.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Chris started trolling.
[SPEAKER_04]: You both started trolling me about how
much I was eating in the back of the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys can do your own goddamn podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone, Chris and I were talking to her
and she was just blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: No answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she goes, why are you guys
picking on me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, that's like five minutes
ago, Lindsey, like what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no one has said anything to her for
like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, I'm not even asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, then where's the
torch?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, it's on the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was totally passed out in the
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but Chris always makes fun of me
for sleeping everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always try to be like, I'm not asleep
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was slumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people get to sleep in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I drive everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dab and Granny for coming to
the secret set.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing with Dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got so much enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hit me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does she wear a shirt that says Dab and
Granny?
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't need a shirt that says Dab and
Granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows who she is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well that'd make her official,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she doesn't even, I mean, she's- It's
already there.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got more Instagram followers than
all of us combined.
Literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got like, I think the last time I
checked it was like 156 or 157,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to progress to Instagram right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody follows me at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I follow myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny because I was listening to the
last podcast and she was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh yeah, I just hit 151 and I was like,
damn, I think she's at 157 already.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like- Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lady gets it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for just a little over an
hour, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay just said something that made me think
about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want more people to follow you on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell everybody listening right
now, how they can stalk you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say it right into the top of the mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I am on Instagram, but I don't have
it on social media because I said I was
[SPEAKER_06]: protesting them, but I do have,
uh, I got Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can anybody stalk you if they want
to, if they want to check you out while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're listening to your sexy voice,
they can go to, uh, well, my Facebook
[SPEAKER_06]: private.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, I don't have a Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell him about Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see what my name is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use the hashtag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet that Adam guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at chicken fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: C H I C K E N P H I S H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow them on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys send them some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when you ramble toward this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my handle when I was driving a
truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that a fish with the band fish
or just happened to have a pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're a fish fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, why didn't we just start the podcast
like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you was talking about, uh,
I've been to a couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your favorite show?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what year, what era?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just stumped him.
[SPEAKER_06]: 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good, that's a good run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a bunch of 99 shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that really, what was a funny,
I've heard of them and I knew that down
[SPEAKER_06]: for disease song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Swimming around in the fish tank,
but you know, back in cleaner back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: nineties, I couldn't just go to a Torrance
site and grab the whole catalog or some
[SPEAKER_06]: band that I've heard of, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's too easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids are spoiled nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend won tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend won tickets to the fish show the
next day on the radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like the 10th color or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I heard it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually heard it on the radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went over, we still have pay phones
back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Called him up and said, Hey, you're taking
me to the fish concert.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I put, you know, I said, I knew that
one song.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that one song.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't play it by the way,
but I knew that one song.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was prepared to sing along with them,
but they didn't play it, but everything
[SPEAKER_06]: they did play, I kind of dug.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to see fish, do not expect to
hear your favorite song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now after I got into them, I went and seen
them again in Charleston, uh, Virginia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go all the way up there, not Charleston,
Charlottesville where the university of
[SPEAKER_06]: Virginia is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I felt like the old guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was, there was an older couple
behind me, but I somehow felt older than
[SPEAKER_06]: they was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the one thing I'll, my wife,
women went with me this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to you, baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Santana Odell, but, uh, bring her next
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.
[SPEAKER_06]: She wanted to come this time, but she had
some things she had to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I told her about, you know,
soon as I went to the one at Winston
[SPEAKER_06]: Salem, North Carolina, the first one,
soon as the lights went out, joints lit up
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy didn't smoke, but you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked over here and I see a 14 year old
field sitting there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, yo man, let me hit that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he, he gave me the whole joint fired
up another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: 14 too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of felt obligated.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was above age.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't 21, but I was 19, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I felt obligated to take it from a 14
year old kid smoking a Grunner.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he pulled out another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he had me drunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he wouldn't let me bring no weed,
but anyway, I come prepared the second
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told my wife, I'm like, as soon as
these lights go out, you about to see
[SPEAKER_06]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see all the joints fired up and she's
like, oh yeah, I can dig this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I've seen all the people
dancing around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told her all about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: She tripped out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to go see him again out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be here this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best, doing my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, yes, his ticket sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sold the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you got a lot of money,
you're going to have too much damn money.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, it's like a eight package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, get a huge package.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably looking close to 200 bucks
one night per person and they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: three nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just put his head down in defeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come once a year.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come to Colorado once a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they usually had dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they're at this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The giant soccer field, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell out that giant soccer field
three nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never miss a Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast will come out the Monday
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and while you guys are listening to
this, I'm probably hanging out with Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see Doug Benson Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the, uh, Jeff Tate thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is fish at
dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Monday, Doug Benson at comedy
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably taking a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll dab him out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug's my homie after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time he called me out on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you got me too high rusted
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wrecked him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse my coughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also Cisla Kalanji at Cervantes,
uh, September 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a Rasta, if you're into that
reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's getting awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just continuous now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen Cisla.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a time here when you had a few
good concerts at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer and a few good concerts at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no concerts during the not
beginning or end of summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't those two, like three week
sections of time, there wasn't anything
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dirty fish kid in me used to just pack
up the car and go where the concerts were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's continuous here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always got something going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever been to Telluride?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been to almost everything,
but the Telluride Blues Fest and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluegrass Fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up there like every other Friday,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They always got something going on up
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That little mountain town stays busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That fucking town is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just the view.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been up there once and it was an
amazing time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would play the lottery just to win
something so I could buy a house up there
[SPEAKER_06]: and just tell everybody to fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an extra house in Telluride
and you're cool as fuck and you're tired
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, my buddy Juicy J will trade you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got two packs of pre-rolls and a spot
exit bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could donate pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll throw one gram of hash in.
[SPEAKER_04]: All he wants to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him the whole table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email can go to, if we get Juicy J a
spot up in Telluride so that he could get
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it on the table?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have five rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five rooms in Telluride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone looking to donate?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because everybody's going to want to come
and visit with me and rent one room out to
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get behind this dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email,
girlfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to take your offers for free
housing in Telluride.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of spots in Colorado like
that that are just kind of awesome now all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to be very much seasonal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think people will just give you a
house?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that'll work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change of things have happened this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on Twitter and see my sexy body.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you weren't married, I was going to be
like, we need the sugar mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is my sugar mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, it's time for you to do your
plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell all the people that are still
listening how they can find you on all the
[SPEAKER_04]: social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my Instagram and my Periscope are the
Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, I almost fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just say LOL like how loud?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I say that all the time,
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my Instagram, my Periscope are the
Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Twitter is the Travel Stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Snapchat is Traveling Stoner without
the G.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's everything, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where do I go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I actually started out in Jersey and
moved down to Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out here in Colorado, and I kind of
just like travel everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many states you've been in?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many states have I actually been in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, I haven't like actually done a
count since I came out and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to do a recount.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've smoked a joint in 48 states.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is impressive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very respectable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've even snuck over into Mexico,
but that's probably for a later podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty long.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I've smoked a joint in Mexico,
snuck over in a limousine, smoked a joint
[SPEAKER_06]: in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a limousine, can you say snuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would going further be a bad legal choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just love that part of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard snuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I heard limousine and I just
smiled really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike just makes me laugh because he's
like, I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike kind of follows the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't want to get you in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, I really want to
hear the rest of that story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like I said, it's it's a pretty long
story.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be part two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll do live back for another
episode for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure everybody's cool with
it because it gets pretty vulgar at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can handle this at a later episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole other show.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it just got jotted down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the odds of it happening just went up
to like 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a future episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was loving to hear your 65.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to give a big shout out,
though, to like in the past couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks, I've been on the podcast a lot
these past couple of months, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have had a lot of people message me
about the podcast and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: great podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, listen to it this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Loved it like the day it drops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like by seven a.m., there's usually one
person that has messaged me and said,
[SPEAKER_04]: already listen to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to give a big shout out to
everybody that has been listening and
[SPEAKER_04]: messaging me to say that the podcast has
been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Linz, for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you and Granny and Brett have been
on the show frequently, the listens have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Instagram and Twitter followers have
gone up on all of the accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rasta Jeff, the Irie Genetics and the
GFYH account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your social media skills are fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you're killing it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all those people that message
Linz and don't message me for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to all you guys for listening
to the show and participating with Linz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I get so many messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep messaging her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to send me a message,
I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I owe a huge shout out to that one
mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: She messages me and tells me how great the
episode is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: She Snapchats it almost every Monday
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like getting ready and it's like the
girl from the heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hear it in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll be in the bathtub or she'll be
taking her morning dabs or on her morning
[SPEAKER_00]: hike or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you, girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name's that one mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think her Snapchat is mountain smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I couldn't find her today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then her Instagram is that one
mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: But shout out to you, girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're doing good in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody, if you're listening to the
show, we've been going for an hour and 18
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means with the intro I put on this,
we're probably about an hour and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love all the people that listen this
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out at the table with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put new light bulbs in the chandelier
and it's all bright and shiny in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a whole new place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It woke up the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made everybody a little more talkative.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Mike for coming,
