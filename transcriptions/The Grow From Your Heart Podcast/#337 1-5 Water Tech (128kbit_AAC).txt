[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 337 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, put some fresh water
in the bong because it's time for the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 337.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, this episode of the podcast is
brought to you by my friends at the Hella
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that's all the advertising for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by telling you what I've been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Guava
Papaya Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chem 4 and papaya mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is labeled as sour fuel and soft fruit
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got sort of a sour fuel, and then
there's a weird like a green gummy bear or
[SPEAKER_00]: a green gummy worm sort of a flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice rip and head high to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me kind of slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I'm just kind of chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I could be more hyper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I could use some caffeine or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Guava Papaya Nectar from Green Dot
Labs tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me nice and stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I've been dabbing in style
because our friends Adam Hill and Hemperco
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me the Highest Host Collab Gift Box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very cute collectible pink box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got Adam Hill's face on it and it
says what all over the box because Adam
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill likes to say what.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some cool branding all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you open the box up, you are
styled out and ready to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is everything you need to dab inside
this box except some dabs and a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, you're pretty much ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I busted the box open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a rig inside the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very cute little rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shaped like a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like maybe a small cup that you'd
get some maybe if you ordered orange juice
[SPEAKER_00]: in at McDonald's or something or some fast
food joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that style of a cup shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a straw coming out of it for a
mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part is on the front part of the
rig, there is a picture of my boy Adam
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see him going, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says Adam Hill times Hemper on
the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a disc perk which was actually
done in an amber color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the straw itself was done in an
amber color also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way that the mouthpiece kind of
flares out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those flared out mouthpieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great little rig from our friends at Adam
Hill and Hemperco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also they threw in a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it came with a 14 millimeter banger,
a male banger that fits right into the
[SPEAKER_00]: rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is super thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds heat really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much all I needed now was a
torch and some dabs and I was able to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I've got that, but wait,
there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They included a whole bunch of sweet
accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over everything,
but there's a pack of Q-tips in there to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the new banger clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of my favorite things was
random.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some snap cap alcohol swabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got alcohol Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a Q-tip that you crack the tip
and then it becomes wet with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got some alcohol soaked
Q-tips to clean your banger, to help clean
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super helpful there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some papers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some stickers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wristband.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a stash pocket on the back of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also my favorite part,
there's an Adam Ill air freshener for your
[SPEAKER_00]: car.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few other cool items in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a silicone ashtray with a cone in
the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can cash your bowls on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small torch lighter so that you
can light your blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hemp wake in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other small
accessories, but it's a really well put
[SPEAKER_00]: together package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was well thought out and I
wanted to make sure to say thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemperco and my buddy Adam Ill and also a
big shout out to Deb and Granny for making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure I got on the list for one of these
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody for taking
such good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right you guys, one more thing to talk
about before we get into the main topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of episodes ago, I talked about
my strain Arise and I requested my
[SPEAKER_00]: audience to go to Leafly and help me get
Arise posted on the website Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly is a website that many people go to
to find strain recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They list a lot of strains there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read reviews from other consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what it smokes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what the high is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how it smells and tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also click on the strain and get a
bunch of information about how it grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: about how it was bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly is a great resource for a lot of
people who are new to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and want to discover new strains
without having to go to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a gram of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good place for them to find out
what they're interested in and what may
[SPEAKER_00]: get their attention and also what may work
for them medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to get Arise listed on
Leafly.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was say hey guys go do this for
me and I gave vague instructions on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then I've gotten a couple of
messages saying hey dude how do I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that it is hard to figure out
where to create a new strain review if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not familiar with Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a brief explanation on how to
do a review on a strain that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: exist on Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These instructions are based on using the
website, not the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the app in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open up a web browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Leafly.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then either log in or create an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to create an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take you that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have an account to leave a
review or to create a new strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So create a new account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Log in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there you will click on your
name and it will bring a menu with other
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that menu it'll say profile,
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says add strain review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you want to click.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add strain review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take you to the page where you
can actually add a new strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says create a new review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says enter name.
[SPEAKER_00]: In box one right there, just type the word
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is not currently in Leafly's
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on step two, where it says select item
to review, you will have to click add
[SPEAKER_00]: arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then step three is select type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not reviewing an edible or a
topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, select category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Sativa dominant hybrid,
but it is a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you've clicked on all of that,
it will take you to the next page,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where you can type a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ask you to rate this strain
overall review, one through five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I encourage you to give five
stars, but be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't feel like it was worth five,
give it what you feel like it deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, what do you think about this
strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about the appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in what you like about the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to continue on with the
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is flower or
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you smoking buds or was this dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next question is smoke or
vaporized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you roll one up or did you put it in
the vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your next option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next thing you get to answer is
you get to talk about the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this get you aroused?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you creative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you energetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on any of the things that you feel
like apply to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a box for other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type in any words there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it had some sort of an effect on you,
make sure you list that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next option is medical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this had some sort of a medical effect,
if it eased some sort of a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: condition for you, type that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already got cramps, depression,
eye pressure, and things like that listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it did something for you medicinally,
please type that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it worked for your Alzheimer's,
your anorexia, your anxiety, if it worked
[SPEAKER_00]: for anything on this list, please click on
that and it'll highlight it and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: add that to your review.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also that box where it says other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in anything that worked for you that
is not listed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says add potency information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to know the potency,
if you bought it at a dispensary in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, it will have the potency listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and type that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will say add flavor information.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on that tab, it brings up a
bunch of things that all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: click on them and highlight them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're highlighted, it will be
added to your review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got ammonia, apple, berry,
butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of great things listed
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey, lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a lot of options for listing
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really get specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll let you click on a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to click on as many flavors
as you taste it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next question is dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember where you picked it up,
go ahead and type that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't remember, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got it on the street, if you grew
it, if you don't want to reveal where it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from, you can leave that tab blank
and that will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the end, you just click save my
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have successfully reviewed
Arise and you have helped me get one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: proudest creations listed on the website,
Leafly.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate all of your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I ask you guys to do something on
every single episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either ask for Patreon help or ask for
iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm up here asking for you to go
to a totally different website and create
[SPEAKER_00]: a new account and review my strain for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do appreciate all of the support and
I couldn't do what I'm doing without your
[SPEAKER_00]: guys' love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm only nine minutes into this
show and my throat is starting to sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is starting to get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pound a bunch of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I get back, we're going to
talk about watering our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was gone, I took some dabs of some
Dr. Who Full Spectrum Extract from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes like a strawberry kiwi
Snapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says passion fruit,
guava and strawberry taffy, but I got more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a kiwi strawberry Snapple sort of a
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of woke me up, snapped me out of that
little mellow buzz from the other dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I pressed pause and took a
break and hydrated and medicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to come back and talk
about watering our plants, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we do every day, something that seems so
simple, something that we can really do
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong if we're not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into watering our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about something that I
call one through five water tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I use to train new
employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I go over with anybody who
waters plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get trained on one through five water
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I could recommend to every
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I can recommend to every
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watering with a pitcher,
if you're watering with a watering wand,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're watering with an automated drip
system, however you have chosen to water
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, this will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, when you're watering the
plants, we need to saturate our medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to leave dry spots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to wet everything, but we don't
want to drown the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need enough water in there to get
everything wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a little bit of runoff,
but then you don't want so much water in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that they're spongy and the plants
are drowning and you forced out all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice balance that you need to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a way to help you dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes taught us a very long time
ago in one of the very first grow videos I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever watched, Jorge said, water should be
abundant, but not excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want an abundance of water,
but not excessive water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea behind that is to water them
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a lot of water to where the
whole medium, all of the cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the soil is saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little water coming out of the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the water is abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't water it again until it needs
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got abundance and not excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also focus on not getting all of the water
directly in the center of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are growing outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your freshest, hungriest, most vigorous
roots are out there at the outer edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water the outer edge of the plant and
let the water work its way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go just pouring the water dead
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get the whole pot saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying you want the whole pot
saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pouring nutrients into your
solution, you're pouring that water into
[SPEAKER_00]: that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that everywhere so that every
root can eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to have to go digging
around to try to find whatever you just
[SPEAKER_00]: fed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the plus life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to just go, ah yeah,
there's plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want those roots to be saturated
or you want that dirt to be saturated so
[SPEAKER_00]: those roots know right where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just touching it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hand delivered to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just brought it right to me on a
cafeteria tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to eat up this plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to eat up this shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to eat up this HD and some
fulvic and we're just going to take it up
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't have to go anywhere for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So saturate your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's actually talk a little bit about
one through five water tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: One through five is a good way to balance
out your wet and dry cycles in your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants get too dry or if they're
too wet, you will have pH fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have slow root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will stop eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have diminished yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are too wet or too dry for
too long, you will definitely see
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen what happens if plants get too
dry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get too wet, I'm sure some of you
have seen what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing as if they get too
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always try to keep our plants right
at the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them right where I call number
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just get right into one through
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for this to work, you're going to need
all of your plants in the same size and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape pot with the same amount of medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn how to adjust that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to teach this technique,
you need everything to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need it to all match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need it uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it a lot easier to teach this
and to keep this into production with your
[SPEAKER_00]: crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the pot that you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the medium that you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that pot just like you were going to
fill it with a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your plant in there just like you're
going to transplant a fresh plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack it down just like you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it all the way done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it just where you're going to water
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have all the amount of cocoa or all the
amount of dirt that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep shaking the pot that's in my hand
that is invisible, but I'm shaking it to
[SPEAKER_00]: get all that dirt packed down to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twist it a couple times to get all that
dirt moved into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack the plant down in there nice and
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and snug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need now is water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pour the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set that pot down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now get another pot and do just the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it with cocoa or soil or whatever
you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it the same as you did the other one,
the same exact method, the same technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it match.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that thing where you pick up the
pot and tap it on the ground a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the dirt in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you just heard me hit the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tap that in there a little bit to get
it into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it to settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake it into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing to all of the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got one you did not pour any
water through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this other pot that we just potted,
for the sake of this training,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say that we're using three gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push the one pot aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get any water right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that plant's going to start looking
angry in a few minutes, but we'll rescue
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get CPR in a little while after
training class is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this other plant that we just put in
the pot, let's soak the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pour like two, maybe three gallons
of water through this pot until water is
[SPEAKER_00]: just gushing out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may kill this plant, but this is the
sake of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to just pour water through
it until it's saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you think it's saturated
with water, pour a little bit more in
[SPEAKER_00]: there just to where it is just pouring out
of the bottom uncontrollably to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you've made a mess on the floor and you're
like, what the hell is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of mad at me about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, why do I have all this
water on the floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for the sake of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to soak that plant to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while all that water is running out
of there, I want you to pick that pot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a fabric pot, it's going
to be heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to grab it with two
hands by the edges and it's going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to stretch on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be real heavy and all the
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to act like a big grocery bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the dirt is going to cave to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get real cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a plastic pot,
you're going to need two hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to grab it under the
lips on the edges and try to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the weight of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we're going to start teaching
one through five water tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's saturated, overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That other pot that we pushed to the side
that we didn't put any water in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick that pot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to pick it up, you might
accidentally throw it up into the air
[SPEAKER_00]: after picking up that number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be super light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
range of one through five water tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea behind water tech is picking up
each and every single plant and deciding,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this a one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a four?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a five?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then understanding how to water it
appropriately based on your professional
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you'll be a professional after this
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, when you pick up the plant
and you almost throw it up into the air
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so dry, that's a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to tell by looking at
the plant that it is at a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are drooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant looks sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to tip over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top soil or the top of your cocoa,
the surface is starting to look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: crispy and crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that it is visibly dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a sign that your plant is slowly
dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got the risk of death and also you
are absolutely going to have diminished
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are losing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole time that plant is sitting there
looking like death, you are wasting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are moving backwards with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not making any productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are torturing that plant and pissing
it off and wasting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another result of a number one,
you're fucking fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in a commercial grow and I'm
the manager and I walk in and those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are a number one, whoever was in charge
that day is coming to the office and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about it and you may not
come back after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number one and don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to fire you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, number two is when the plants
need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just starting to droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, can we get a drink now?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when they start to droop,
you can see the difference in the top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That top layer is just starting to change
to brownish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not totally, it's not black anymore
like when it was moist and it's not gray
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's totally dry or it hasn't
turned that cork color because it's cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't gotten that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, it's like, hey, we could use
some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the prime time to give
it some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number two, the growth is kind of
slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are going, hey man, we could use
some water pretty soon, but that's right
[SPEAKER_00]: when you want to give it some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when it hits to number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, number three is when it is
perfect and thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three is where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to number three though,
you're going to have to water either at a
[SPEAKER_00]: four or a five and let it dry down to that
three and then maybe just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: past to that two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it sounds really easy if you've got a
home grow, but what if you work in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and you've got to leave
overnight?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of commercial facilities,
we clock out at five or seven PM and we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't come back until seven or nine in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are still going to be,
the lights are still going to be on for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while when we leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we work an eight or a nine or a 10 hour
shift, the lights are on for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still going to have two hours of
lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still going to be, or if they're
in veg, they're still going to be on for
[SPEAKER_00]: way longer, but the plants are still going
to be on so they're still going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to be drinking and then
you're going to have the night cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to last that shift
until we come back to work, whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we leave at, we'll say five and then
you have six, seven, eight, nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 11, 12, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 10 solid hours till anybody comes
back and checks on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to stay wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I say maybe water them at a
five and let them chill out and work their
[SPEAKER_00]: way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them cycle through overnight and then
by the time you get there in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully they're right at a three or
maybe at a two so that you can water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's an important thing to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to overwater at that five
just so that by the time you come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: work the next morning, they're not at a
one and everybody goes home because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are no plants to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue on with the
number three is where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we would like to stay all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the right amount of oxygen in the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is where we would like to stay,
but we've got airflow and evaporation and
[SPEAKER_00]: science and nature to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't stay at a constant,
at a constant three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is kind of, if you poke your finger
down into the dirt, just about two inches
[SPEAKER_00]: and you feel some moisture in there,
that's about a number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are just going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that is a number three when
those plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a number three, you guys try to,
you're going to have to dial this in and
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, this is going to take some
practice in your own garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I gave you a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I gave you a number five to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have to watch
them a little bit and see where that fine
[SPEAKER_00]: line for number three is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch your plants, see when they're super
happy, pick up the pot, feel the weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably at number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward to number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four is when you're just a little
bit too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, number four is where I water
my plants to right when they're watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm watering, I aim for number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's just a little, little bit too
much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 10 to 20% of my water that goes
in is dripping out of the bottom of my
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, but I'm making sure to water in a
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just pour the water right into the
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go around the edge of the pots and watch
the water fill into the middle as it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I water until about 10 or 20% is coming
out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pot is heavy, but they're not goopy
and muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not mud in your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're going to have to play
with this to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much perlite you've got
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much cocoa you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to depend on a few things,
but you'll be able to dial this in and
[SPEAKER_00]: customize this to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the manager, this is a good way
to teach your staff on one through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the manager, you're catching on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the manager, you're bright
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They trusted you and you're bright enough
to be able to catch on to what I'm saying
[SPEAKER_00]: by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a home grower, this is a good
way to teach your backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got somebody that's going to
come help you grow when you go on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to get your girlfriend into
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're kind of leery on teaching her
how to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way to involve your other half
into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to get the kids in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got a new grower, whoever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good way to teach people one
through five technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number four is where I water my plants
to right in the morning when I'm giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them that fresh first feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I aim for number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit too wet, but if you
watch them an hour or two later,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've hit number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the lights go off,
they're just about to hit number two,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't cycle through much through
the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are going to be just fine
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights come on in the morning,
they're either going to be right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: low end and number three, just getting a
little bit dry or right at the top end of
[SPEAKER_00]: number two, just like, Hey, you should
water us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm not sure why, but at this
point in the recording for about 30
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, the file just started making a
hissing noise and it sounded terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only missed about 30 seconds of
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to figure out why this keeps
happening and I'm going to correct the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, but it was only about 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut out the annoying hiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you've got more than like 10
or 20% of what you're putting in coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bottom, then you're starting to
overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only want about 10 or 20% coming out of
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the dreaded number
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were at number five, your medium is
soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just water gushing out of the
bottom of your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be sitting in stagnant water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are drowning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting any oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are drooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably starting to get kind of
soft at the base where the stick meets the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get mushy there because
they're starting to rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are risking root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are risking stem rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are risking death when the plants are
that moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you are certainly slowing down your
growth and diminishing your yields when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get your plants to a number five level
of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys pay attention to our number four
is and stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water the plants, wait for some to come
out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing comes out, porn a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a three gallon pot,
maybe just pour in a half a gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you need more, you can always add
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember you can't reach in there and take
water out of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's one through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will kill the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, you run the risk of killing the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is right where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to figure out how to keep those
plants right around the three for as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they get too dry, you got to
water them again without over watering
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is going to be challenging based
on the size of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are smaller, they are much
more critical through that one through
[SPEAKER_00]: five phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot more to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get bigger, they can handle a
lot more stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can handle a lot more abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that root ball gets developed in that
pot, they can definitely take more
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got big plants and you do
need to go away for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can soak those up to a number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that you're not keeping
them too soggy for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in a large grow, I'm running three
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plants that weigh 2000 grams
when we harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants right before we leave,
I soak the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I soak them to a five, but I'm confident
that by the time I get back to work the
[SPEAKER_00]: next day, they're only going to be at a
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to learn how to dial in
those cycles with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger plants will be more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller plants are always going to be
less forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will let you know when you make
mistakes right away and their cycles will
[SPEAKER_00]: not be as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got to be away from the grow,
for several hours, make sure you water
[SPEAKER_00]: those little plants right before you go
because they could dry up overnight if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that is one through five
watering tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to keep it as simple as I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get a pot and fill
it and make that a number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get another pot
and soak the shit out of it and make that
[SPEAKER_00]: a number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get another one and get water
running out 10 or 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll be able to figure out where
the three and the two lie from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll be able to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're setting up an auto water
system, that will help you dial in how
[SPEAKER_00]: much water to give it and how often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll also help you to teach the new
people how to dial in that garden
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, cannabis is very picky
and strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some plants may want a lot of water and
some plants may not want any water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to each cultivar,
not just each table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to think about which plants
go on which table if you're going to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up an auto system because Durbin poison
wants barely any water where Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: will drink all of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to plan on that
and pay attention and adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's what I've got
for you on one through five watering tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys learned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to teach somebody else
something about one through five water
[SPEAKER_00]: tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds simple, but it's probably
something a lot of people are making
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes on and overlooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also something that managers will be
able to train and grow techs on,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be very helpful for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you
guys again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you guys in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information that you need will
be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who has been
supporting the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't forget to go to Leafly and
add a rise to the Leafly database.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd appreciate your help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave a quick review.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've smoked it, grown it,
consumed it, smelled it, seen it,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, go ahead and leave
your review there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all you guys for hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with a fresh new
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to
Grimbolt who drew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see
you in the next one.
Bye.
