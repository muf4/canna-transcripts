[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No music, I just wanted to get right to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually try to put out a Thursday
quickie episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one may not be so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot to talk about, so let's get
right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I like to start the episode off
by letting you know what I've been smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just finished off the jar of
Starchild OG from our friends at A Cut
[SPEAKER_00]: Above in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at the Fillmore location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells kind of like dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of got a Jack Herrera sort of a
smell, if you're familiar with Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got a train wreck kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super sativa head buzz, gets me talkative,
makes my head spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great podcast dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got some Sour Pez Ambrosia from
our friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to get the Apothecary
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open it up and give it a smell,
it smells like a lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lime and lime kind of a candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a Sour Pez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I smoked it, on the way in,
the inhalation tasted like a lime rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had scraped the inside of a
lime and licked that, and it was pleasant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was really tart, and it was
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh shit, that's a lot of
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the way out, it was just straight
up grapefruit citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smelling the jar again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm picking up more of the grapefruit now
that I'm smelling it again closer to my
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limes and grapefruit, you guys,
this one was really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sour Pez Ambrosia from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these, obviously, super sativa
because my head is going, my eyes are wide
[SPEAKER_00]: open, and I'm ready to ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to get into my main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Instagram Live, and somebody
asked me, how do I feel about people
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with my seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I do have a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are commercially available on
the internet, which means that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting ahold of them, which means people
are growing them, which means they're
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding select males and select
females, which may be great candidates for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, who would I be to say, do not breed
with those great plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to breed with the plants that
come from my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I welcome it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people breeding great projects
with things that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that came from my
Capelton.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole seed line that came from
my Capelton.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are guys breeding with my Black
Cherry Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there are things I don't
even know about being bred with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be mad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not invent the seed stock that I
started breeding with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gifted clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I created a nice clone library for myself
by gathering clones from friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when other dispensaries would have
clones for sale, I would go get them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got clones through various other
means that I won't mention here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nice clone library, and then I got
bored with just growing from clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted something different that not
everybody else had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started getting seeds, and then I
started buying seeds and getting addicted
[SPEAKER_00]: to buying seeds off of the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my breeding stock came from seeds I
bought off of the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept buying those seeds, and I'd find
great stuff, but then I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why do I keep spending money on seeds and
throwing away male plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could learn how to breed myself,
so I started studying breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I built a separate little breeding
area for myself, and I used one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: males that came from a seed pack that I
bought, and I put the pollen on clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had gotten from friends,
and plants that came from seeds that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: bought on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was breeding to clones and seeds by
using a seed that I had purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't be mad at anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to use my seeds for breeding,
I should be honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they find one of my plants that comes
from one of my creations good enough and
[SPEAKER_00]: worthy enough and impressive enough to
continue its genetic line, I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I ask for is credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you write down what the genetics are,
put that you used, whatever of my cross
[SPEAKER_00]: you used, Storm Shadow, fucking Scarlet
Bagonias, write it down, and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna write this down, make sure you write
it down properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you write down genetic crosses,
ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you use a female Stardog plant and a
male Arise, you will write Stardog X
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise, and that's your one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna cross that plant to
something else, you'll put Stardog X Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: in parentheses, so it'll be parentheses,
Stardog X Arise, parentheses, then you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: put an X on either side of that,
depending on if that's the boy or girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that one's gonna be the girl,
it would be parentheses, Stardog,
[SPEAKER_00]: X Arise, parentheses, X, then your boy
plant, whatever that's gonna be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you go ladies first when
you're writing down genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't over make that too
complicated there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I didn't over complicate that for you
guys, but still, ladies first when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: writing down genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't bother me at all when people
breed with my genetics because I am
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with other people's genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when I'm breeding now, I have to get
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to outsource other things because
if I just keep breeding with everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've already got, it's just gonna be
a bunch of inbred stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to pull other male plants out of
somewhere, I've got to get other female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out of somewhere, or I'm just gonna
be doing a bunch of cousin fucking and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make a whole bunch of the same seeds
before too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to have breeding stock that is
not all mine, so which means I have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that I honor them and show
them respect is I clearly label what I
[SPEAKER_00]: used in my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what I'm using and that's
how I don't piss off the other guys and it
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps it fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask you to do the same if you breed
with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've bought the seeds, they're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like can a car salesman say, hey,
now when you drive off with this car,
[SPEAKER_00]: please don't take it to the east side.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd tell me, fuck you, I'm going to the
east side, it's my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if he says, when you buy this
motorcycle, please don't drive it down
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna say, bro, dirt roads with
this motorcycle all day, don't worry,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how I feel about my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy my seeds and you want to breed
with them, have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are yours, you paid for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me some credit if you do breed
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you post pictures, tag me in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool also.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's my rant on how I feel
about people breeding with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have done that rant on another
episode, but that leads me into another
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking on another forum and
somebody said that OG Kush stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another person said that OG Kush stands
for original gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a lot of silly things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to give my opinion and I
would like to start a conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: hear what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go the long route and not tell
you right away what I think OG stands for,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's how I'll, it's gonna be the
punch line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a long time ago there was a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this website, this website is gone,
so you couldn't find it if you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people were raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that were a part of this
website were raided by the DEA and their
[SPEAKER_00]: local authorities for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were a part of this
website that are now prominent members of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that were taken down would
have been dominant members of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry if they weren't raided because of
this website many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This website was home to a lot of cannabis
growers, breeders, and enthusiasts and
[SPEAKER_00]: activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these people were growing at home
and breeding at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these people had gotten seeds
from around the world and brought them
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the United States and were growing
them in small home grows that were fully
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no medical marijuana at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe California was thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these growers were growing and
breeding at home because that was what
[SPEAKER_00]: they had access to was those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were, here's part of where I
think the OG Cush name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody acquired seeds from Cush,
but where's Cush?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna say Cush Mountain, I wanna say
Cush Valley, but I'm sure that those are
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, people got seeds from Cush,
probably from soldiers who traveled
[SPEAKER_00]: overseas and came back with cannabis seeds
and said these came from Cush,
[SPEAKER_00]: either the Cush Mountains the Cush Valley,
wherever they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word Cush was involved in these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were delivered to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they brought them back themselves
and were on this website that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they grew these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they bred with these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think then they took a handful of these
seeds and what I think what was happening
[SPEAKER_00]: on this website is a guy like myself that
could breed would breed seeds and send
[SPEAKER_00]: them out to five or 10, maybe 15 or 20 of
his friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know exactly,
this is a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys would work the seeds and then
send them back or pass them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that somebody was really narrowing
something down and breeding it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of people in a group in different
locations through the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds were being passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd go to one guy, he would breed to it
and do his thing and then he would send
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds back to the original guy plus more
people who would then breed to it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that out of all of this breeding is
where the OG Cush came from is from some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this breeding project that came off of
this website and if you guys haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: caught on by now, if you're OG,
you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website I'm talking about is overgrow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't think that OG stands
for ocean grown because a lot of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: not grown near the ocean and I also don't
think that OG was original gangster
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of the circles that had the
OG Cush originally were not the gangster
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were more hippies and they were more
on the hippie side of life than the
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster side of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't start hearing it be associated
with original gangster until Be Real and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Dre and all those guys started talking
about the chronic and the OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that it came from
overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow the Government is a website
dedicated to cannabis, dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing, dedicated to cannabis
rebelliousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the home for weed and unfortunately
it did lead to a bunch of trouble you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are carried away nowadays with our
internet freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day people got raided because
of the shit that they did online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that paid the price for
us to be here and a lot of them lost
[SPEAKER_00]: everything because of overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that OG Cush was some seeds passed
around from overgrow.com and it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project happening in different
locations through the postal service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of the stuff that came
out of there was OG Cush and that would
[SPEAKER_00]: explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different phenotypes and
different names of OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tahoe OG and the Whatever OG and the
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say the Tahoe and the Crippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Florida and Tahoe California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what part of fucking Florida
the Crippy is from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure someone's yelling into their
fucking device right now saying it's from
[SPEAKER_00]: this part of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got the Crippy and you got the
Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke them, if you get them near
each other, you got the triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar yet very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all similar and all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Cush is because they probably all came
from the same seed stock and have been
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bred somewhere along the line with
the same parent and or grandparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're all different F generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that's got something to
do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's ocean grown because how
are you going to ocean grow if you're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in LA, it's not ocean grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking smog grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not original gangster because the
people that were doing it weren't the
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they would have named it
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my theory is it came from overgrow the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear your rebuttal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply search for the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's easier for you to find me on
Instagram, search for I re underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tweet me at my Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Rasta Jeff 420 or you can tweet
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GF Y H podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear what you think og and
og Kush stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stand behind my statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's over grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, thank you for
listening to me ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been just about 12 minutes,
no intro music, no outro music,
[SPEAKER_00]: just me talking this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have a lot of fun doing this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have a lot of fun doing the
Instagram live feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all my friends that kind of
helped me name a strain today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a little game on Instagram live
where we wrote down strain names and I let
[SPEAKER_00]: people vote on them and I crossed out the
ones we didn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, my vote supersedes all your
guys' votes, but I think we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good name for star dog to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I owe a lot of credit to my friends on
Instagram live for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not following me on
Instagram, please do and check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, speaking of videos on YouTube,
I've got 242 videos up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now I'm slowly making the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube has been cracking down on cannabis
channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put up a whole bunch of
content for it to get taken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what happens in this wave of
destruction that's happening through
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the online services, Instagram,
Twitter, Facebook, Periscope, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: all sent me a new terms of service
agreement to sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are changing on the internet
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to clean up all the smut,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get rid of weed and
dirtiness and I don't want to fall victim
[SPEAKER_00]: to it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to kind of lay low for a
minute and once it kind of chills out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start putting videos up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm caught up on what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm okay for about 35 more videos,
I think, which will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
