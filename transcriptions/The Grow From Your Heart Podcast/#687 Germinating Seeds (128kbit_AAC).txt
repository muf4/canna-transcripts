[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is episode 687 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to talk about
germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to that part of the
show, let's do a few shout outs to a few
[SPEAKER_00]: of those great folks who continue to
support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick it off with the big Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, ye motherfucking
ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I don't want to waste too much
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make this a super long
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the germinating
seeds portion of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are trying to get them
started as the seed maker, a seed seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it could be partly my
responsibility to make sure you have good
[SPEAKER_00]: luck with these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a quick seed germinating
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting all the supplies I need
gathered here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with a big jar of
blue raspberry truffle seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were grown this summer in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will be a great example to get us
going here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the things we need for a
successful germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one ingredient for a successful
seed germination is quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want big, fat, healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any seed that comes from my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you something I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done this on a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never showed anybody this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the actual seeds that you will
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you purchase iri seeds, I'm just going
to dump a couple into the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I would package your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, as I'm packaging, each one would
get set on the table and pressed under my
[SPEAKER_00]: finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I'm pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting a lot of pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not squishing or popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high quality seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pressed so hard it has stuck to my
finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pressed so hard I've got a nice
indention in my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This finger is calloused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a soldier finger for testing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are high quality seeds in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do, I'm going to take
a few of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just dropped them right here into the
lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure they're clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need any seed holes or any of that
stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that to contaminate our
mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't get that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have seed holes and extra junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a jar of uncleaned seeds,
kind of unrefined, unsorted seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pouring them out, making a few
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to put these away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep myself on track here,
but we've got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main ingredient here for
successful germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is honestly how I germinate seeds
that I'm going to run in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I do test seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I do dispensary grow seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any seeds I'm going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get this really technical piece of
equipment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the dollar store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should have a rag instead of
paper towels, but today we're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I won't even use the whole
sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily we got the brand that gives you
half sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a half sheet,
be more economical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fold it in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fold in in half and then half again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not very critical at all as being
a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you caught onto that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fold it to this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to move these seeds out of
the way because I don't need them wet just
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump those on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fold it to this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to get this really
expensive fancy technical substance here
[SPEAKER_00]: called bottled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far everybody should be able to follow
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all have these products readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm just going to soak this paper
towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pouring bottled water over the
paper towel until it is saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to take much more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of let it sit right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got a little bowl over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a cereal bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a small cereal bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pour this excess water into
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a saturated paper towel
sitting on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we haven't gotten really technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't gotten really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody can follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better close up this water with all this
electronic shit around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the stuff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them on one side of your paper towel
that is wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drop them right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really easily, real gently,
I'm going to take the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to fold it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've just got a paper towel folded
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some water coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let that water drip out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it quits dripping right about
there, we're basically done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take this and I'm going to
stick this inside of a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm putting it in the baggie is
I want to retain this moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got places to go today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get this baggie open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got places to go today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that by placing this inside of this
baggie, I've now trapped this moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, we've just created a little
humidity zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are in there getting really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's humidity trapped in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set this in a warm place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a grow light that is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a T5 light right on top of that
grow light will be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get this seed going and it will
start germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't super technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that is how I germinate all of
my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll take this plate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to pour this excess water
right into this bowl that we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually this would go sit on the grow
light, but right now we're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it right here on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now while I'm recording, this will just
chill right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take probably somewhere around 24
to 48 hours before you start seeing little
[SPEAKER_00]: tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these seeds to pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't touch this or open this for
probably 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm going to put it on top of
a T5 grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to roast these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to cook them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to barbecue them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ruin them with too much
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice I got a long sleeve shirt on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty cold in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be okay here in this ambient
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're okay, they're okay in the
environment in which you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in my veg area, right on top
of that T5 light, they'll just be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit cozier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't generally put them on a heating
mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only doing that because it is winter
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are shifting from the cold or from the
warm to the cold season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to risk these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to risk your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the type of climate when I
would use some heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that grow light is all I'm going to
use and that will be enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some notes I want to make sure I
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to fold the paper towel,
wet the paper towel, put the seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, fold it up, put it in the baggie,
and we're going to let it sit for 24 to 48
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to check on it through
the magic of technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planned ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I germinated some seeds yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't opened this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been sealed up for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pop it open now together
and we're going to see what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have been sitting on top of a T5
light, just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pop them open together and
we will see what we're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will take a picture with my phone
and insert this into the video just so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a better glimpse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I am impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is coming up on
camera, but we have got some sprouts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be very gentle if I were you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, this is a germination test on a
new line for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these aren't hypercritical for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to go anywhere,
but this is what you will see in 24 to 48
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got little, they look like spermies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the tail on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to put it somewhere that I
can't see what shows up on the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it right here in front of the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could see the little tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's popping up, but it's got little tails
coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, these seeds are ready to go
into cocoa, dirt, hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: however you're going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I'm going to snap a
quick photo and try to keep talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I would get my container,
whatever I'm going to put them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, in my situation,
I would take a beer cup, a red solo cup
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with a fluffy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any brand names or
anything like that, but a soil-less mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa with a lot of perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fill my container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pack it not tight, but semi-tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd press it down so that it's in there so
that the seed has something to dig
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the seed to dig a little bit,
but also don't want it to struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got it semi-packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water my medium at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I put the seed in there,
I would water that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my soil-less mix in my cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your container has drainage
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using cups, you have to put your
own holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to fill the cup up with
water and create a mud situation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So poke some holes in a cup, fill it with
your medium of choice, then water it at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH adjust the water to somewhere between
5.8 and 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't add any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may add some microbes at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually don't add any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the soil that I buy has already
got microbes in it, so I don't need to add
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my container with holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil-less mix or cocoa with perlite in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I would put my finger into
that mix about to the first knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One knuckle deep is as deep as I would go
right in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make a knuckle deep indention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would put a seed right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me snap a picture of these seeds and
then I will show you how I would put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see this picture right here will
end up in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, those little tails we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I would take a seed and I
would gently set it right into other kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuck to the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful pulling them off the paper
towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this one's got a really long
tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can see how long the tail is on
this seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting it in front of the black
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that helps you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really long tail on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the direction in which it wants to
be planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tail goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your roots to grow down into the
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your seed to grow up and pop out
of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful, this is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very beautiful specimen of a
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that we decided to
germinate these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to zoom in for you and do some
camera cuts and I'm thinking ahead,
[SPEAKER_00]: but look at the health and beauty of this
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very beautiful seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very lucky that we germinated these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very glad that I got to show you
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are vigorous seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally it wouldn't stand up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root shouldn't hold it up,
but this root is acting like a stem
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so strong and super vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd want to plant it with the root
going down and the seed pointing up and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't plant it so deep that it has to
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fingers are kind of big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still going knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a short finger, maybe only halfway
to a knuckle, but just go knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set that seed right in there to where it's
pointing up and then just scoop the dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: right back over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of lightly backfill it and then
that seed, the taproot will dig down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top will start popping up and now you
have successfully germinated and planted
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure there are more notes that
I want to keep up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need to keep your seeds in a good,
your seedlings in a good environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The T5 light that these have been sitting
on top of, now they're going to go right
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get a little bit bigger,
I will move them to the LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: My small veg space is a T5 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way that things are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would go under a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep them on a minimum of 18 hours
of daylight, of lights on schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more, maybe 20, maybe 24 for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I would just keep them
under a strong vegetative light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need a lot of light right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see them stretching, they're not
getting enough light, but if you're giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them proper light, they'll stay short and
squatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need intense light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need the right light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A T5 or an LED will be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them under a light with somewhere
more than 18 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes my veg spaces get 20 hours of
light and four hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do 19.5, sometimes 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in that area will be good for
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't flower until you put them on
1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get them under a solid vegetative
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're stretching, they want more
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're staying short, they're getting
enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look like they're kind of roasting
on you, they're getting too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you'll have to learn to
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be plant-specific,
light-specific, environment-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a trick to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the details you'll have to
learn in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment, I would keep them around 75
to 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is optimal for the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit higher, maybe better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colder will slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher will get them growing a little more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher humidity is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that sometimes it's hard to
get high humidity, especially right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in winter in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher humidity, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 to 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not use domes for my seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people put their seedlings
in a dome or put some sort of cover on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that makes for weak
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want these seedlings to come out and be
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Domes are for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cut a clone, the clone doesn't
have a root source, a root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: a life source to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones have to survive from the
humidity in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no moisture in the air,
they don't have any way to sustain
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have roots to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to control that humidity in the
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings don't need that dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they want exposure to the
environment, exposure to the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes them tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we don't have to harden them off like
we do clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the dome kind of turns your
seedlings into... it makes them weak,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them little bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't give them the vigor that they need
from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want these seeds going strong from day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not use a dome for my seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I do not use a heating
mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do keep saying I'm going to put these
seedlings on top of the T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really cold at this time of year in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may use that T5 light just to get them
germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Past that, there's not going to be any
heat mat, nothing underneath them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen more people cook and roast
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have honestly roasted and boiled more
seeds than I have germinated when using a
[SPEAKER_00]: heat mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep checking my notes to make sure I'm
getting it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the seed should shell will get
stuck to your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seedling will start to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pop up out of the dirt and then
it'll go up toward the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little shell on here sometimes gets
stuck to the seed and people really panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your seed may open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a little plant forming and
the little helmet just might be stuck on
[SPEAKER_00]: there or it might not even have opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not cause for concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is no reason to panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to fix if you are careful
and delicate and pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way in my experience,
I call it taking off the helmet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The helmet got stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to get the helmet off and get
that soldier back into battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the helmet will get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way in my opinion,
I get a spray bottle that you could spray
[SPEAKER_00]: like just a little squeeze sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you use it to clean the windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a spray bottle and just mist it with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get some water, throw it in a spray
bottle, spray the seedling, spray the
[SPEAKER_00]: helmet and you'll notice it softens it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I want to risk doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you soften it up, you can just
grab it and you can just probably pull it
[SPEAKER_00]: right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one doesn't want to come off yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it were opened up more,
it would slide right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big clumsy gorilla fingers
like me, I'm a big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got big sausage fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to use some tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there gently with tweezers and just
pull the helmet right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it with some water and just let it
come right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pulling and struggling,
let it wait a couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature pushes that shell off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in time with water, with a little help
and a little encouragement, you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get that off without causing
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't panic and don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water will act like a lubricant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make everything separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make it super easy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that seed shell gets stuck,
just moisten it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have tweezers, if you have
confidence, if you got a steady hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pull it right off with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, I've got a lot of seeds so I
could play with them and learn that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff and figure out those kind of
experiments for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to be delicate with these
because they're seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small, little, delicate baby life
forms, but they're not precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can handle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I'm picking them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm playing with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very viable seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm throwing it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fingers, the acids on my fingers are
probably not good for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably be wearing gloves,
but this is nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be microbes in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be roly-poly's.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this plant grows, if it were to grow in
nature, a goat would piss on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind would knock it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are resilient plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature made this plant very resilient,
and then the breeders have definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: found the keepers out of those resilient
plants, and we've made it even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be too afraid to handle your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be too afraid to handle your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, have you ever just examined a
seedling like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started off as a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cracked open, and now there's life
coming out of it, and it's going to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: in in 12 or 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be smoking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
