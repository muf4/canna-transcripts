[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was setting up the recording equipment
and I just happened to notice that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: 418 in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy pre 420 mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke a dab and then let's do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting myself together a dab right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on some double OG full
spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a blend of legend OG and sour
double.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says it should taste like pine
sour and lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back of the package says sixty two
point zero three percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are rapidly approaching 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start heating up this dab
nail and we're going to take a dab and we
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for jumping
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of rambling while I heat up
this dab nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it nice and hot so we could take a dab
together and keep an eye on the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got just a few seconds and it is going to
be 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like this dab nail
should be getting hot enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be plenty of heat for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a fat dab with that
cool down for just a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No need to roast my lungs off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that just a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to ramble while it cools
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need my dab nail super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want it hot enough to roast this
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I put the carb cap on,
I want it to get nice and milky thick with
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just about to the ideal temperature
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 420 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clock has struck 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a dab
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is a tasty dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the double OG full spectrum
extract from our friends at Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me talking a little bit funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely getting the dab sweats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel every milligram of THC flowing
through my brain and body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's try to get my shit
together and start a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 509 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you

[SPEAKER_00]: Since I like to stick with traditions,
let's talk about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys just heard me take a fat dab of
Double OG Full Spectrum Extract from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it is a blend of Legend OG and Sour
Double.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
pine, sour, and lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first hit it, I got that pine
straight to the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the smoke was in my face,
while it was in my lungs, and as it came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of my mouth, I certainly did taste
that sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was piney and sour coming out,
and now that it's been a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, my mouth and the room taste and
smell lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will agree that that is a perfect
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pine, sour, and lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also might be three of my favorite
combinations together for a flavor in a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes delicious, and
obviously, I am heavily medicated because
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot stop rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs for the Double OG Full Spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all you freaky people,
in this episode, I'm going to read an
[SPEAKER_00]: email from one of our friends.

[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to the Patreon campaign in the

[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I get a lot of emails and
messages from people who say that they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to contribute to Patreon in the
future, but they are not in a financial
[SPEAKER_00]: situation to help out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not stress yourself out over helping my
Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect anything in return for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this podcast because I was given a
gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the ability, the skills,
the art of growing cannabis very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came to me very naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got plants and they flowered and looked
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any problems in my first
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have spider mites, but we got rid of
them pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my very first personal grow,
I had spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been very blessed with my
ability to cultivate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the level on which I'm able to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to do it in personal grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been blessed with large commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to travel to different states and
different locations and see their
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities and learn how they
do things and also offer help and
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities to improve their facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been very blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also feel like I am very blessed to
have this gift of communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I speak pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I speak in a way that a lot of
people can communicate with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the dudes and hippies,
they can talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the young ladies can talk to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like grandma can talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the gangsters and whoever
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all understand the way that I
speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from the East Coast,
the West Coast, maybe from other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, I think I speak clearly enough
that you can understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I use those two gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't use those two gifts that I
was given, whatever you believe in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that creation gave me these gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't use it, it would be
disrespectful to that creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I would explode or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a few other things with great
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if I didn't share that
passion with the world, something would go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong inside of me physically and or
mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the rubber bands inside that hold me
together would all just start popping if I
[SPEAKER_00]: did not do this podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the long way of saying I do this
because I love you, because I love
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to grow the best cannabis
you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't ever feel obligated to contribute
to my podcast or to pay me anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can say, hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you can give me a high five or one
of those add a boys or a pat on the back
[SPEAKER_00]: or some shit like that, that is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means just as much to me as a
Patreon contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not in a position,
that is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is free for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those folks that do contribute to
Patreon, I'm sure they do not mind you
[SPEAKER_00]: listening for free since they're able to
help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in different spots in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us can do a lot of things
financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us can do a lot of things
physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us can do a lot of things
spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all blessed in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like you need to share a
blessing with me if it would put you out
[SPEAKER_00]: in any way at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to the show for free and do your
best in your garden is a great way to show
[SPEAKER_00]: me love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe also just tell a friend about
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another great way to pay me back a
little bit to say, hey, have you heard
[SPEAKER_00]: this show?
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a cool show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're the friend listening,
do it again and just keep telling people
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the show will grow and then more
people can grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be better cannabis and there
will be better cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, recreational patients,
for everybody to smoke throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the price of cannabis will go down,
will all be growing the best bud on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be good weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will be sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody will be in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest payment that I could
ask for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So show respect to the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show respect and love to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big thanks to everybody on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that dab got me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an email here in front of me,
but before I read it, I want to read a
[SPEAKER_00]: message from one of my Patreon supporters,
somebody who I've developed a friendship
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy says, hey, I'm sorry for the
delay in my Patreon renewal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to wait for a replacement card and
then I got hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was out of commission for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, dude, you got hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't apologize to me for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is anything that myself or the
Irish Army or any of the grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart crew can do for you, you let me
know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a crushed foot, a bruised knee,
a pinched nerve in your neck, some fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up discs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you've got a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, my question is what
strain will heal my crushed and fractured
[SPEAKER_00]: foot faster and what's good for overall
toes to head pain and relief?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what will help heal your
crushed and fractured foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say stay off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the best thing for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put any weight and pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the doc said that plenty of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it hurts, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part where I can be helpful is where
you ask about a strain, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: good for pain from toes to head because
you are seeking relief because everything
[SPEAKER_00]: hurts right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke something that will make
your body go numb and you won't hurt for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can also smoke something that gets
you so high you forget that your body
[SPEAKER_00]: hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two great ways that cannabis
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only downside I have experienced to
using cannabis for pain relief in a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation like this is sometimes if you
break something or pull something or mess
[SPEAKER_00]: your body up real good in one specific
spot where you've got a lot of bruising
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of blood flow, when you smoke,
it may elevate your heart rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may increase your blood flow,
which sometimes makes the painful spot
[SPEAKER_00]: throb a little bit extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely going to be injury and
body and all kinds of different things
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many factors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get nice and baked and wherever
you hurt this foot, your discs,
[SPEAKER_00]: your neck, your back, your neck and your
back, they may hurt more than they do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may start throbbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just an increased blood flow to
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know if that is going to help
heal that area or not by having more blood
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think maybe by having more blood
move around, maybe it would help it heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you could think by having more blood
move around in a bruised area,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could make it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have zero medical professional
qualifications, zero, not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice would be to find a really
strong sativa dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a Double Dragon or a Lemon
Jeffrey, something in that real high
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would find something more endicat
dominant, something like the Hellfire OG
[SPEAKER_00]: or the Liberation OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then smoke a fat bowl of that first thing
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try that as your first smoke of the day
and see how that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that's the first one you've
smoked so you start off nice and fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: your palate's nice and clean, your mind
and your body are still clear and sore,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see what kind of effect each
strain have on your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've done an endicat dominant,
you've done a sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way towards something more
hybrid like maybe try some morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a fat bowl of morning dew first
thing the next morning and see what that
[SPEAKER_00]: does for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is going to make you throb.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is going to make you feel
better and one of those you probably won't
[SPEAKER_00]: even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if none of those provide the relief
and comfort you were looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where we turn to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may go to CBD first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which route you want to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know you from our conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you want to try these THC
routes first, but the CBD never hurts to
[SPEAKER_00]: try.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do get your CBD, make sure it is
from a reliable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given that speech enough times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy your CBD from the gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a quality CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend as much time, energy, effort and
money on your CBD as you do your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and you should have positive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money doesn't always mean quality,
but do the work, put in the effort and you
[SPEAKER_00]: should find a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I would recommend find an
endicat, find a sativa and find a hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoke on those and see which one gives
you the relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: One may make it throb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a nice sativa, you may get so
stoned that you forgot your back even
[SPEAKER_00]: hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the magical wonders of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you forget stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a nice endicat, it may make you
so relaxed that nothing hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, both of those have the opportunity
to really enhance the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get so stoned that all you can
think about is that fucking leg and that
[SPEAKER_00]: foot and your neck, your back,
your neck and your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the only thing you can focus
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the best recommendations I
can make because it is going to be strain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, body type specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all going to be up to your body and
the flowers that you find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of my favorite parts about
cannabis, also one of the most frustrating
[SPEAKER_00]: parts about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know that cannabis is going to
help, but we have to kind of dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you want a sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need an endicat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific turp or a specific
cannabinoid that helps with your
[SPEAKER_00]: condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that we can dose ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you cannot die from consuming
cannabis, you can smoke as much as you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to, to find relief and you can find
that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's okay to go a little bit past
that level to put yourself in that state
[SPEAKER_00]: where you almost panic and you feel a
little bit of discomfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know, that's what happens
when I go this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I take three puffs off this joint
and my neck doesn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I take four puffs off this joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neck feels really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fifth puff, I start getting a little
bit giggly.
[SPEAKER_00]: By number six, oh shit, I need to call a
friend for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to learn how to do that and learn
how to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you learn how to dial in that
medicine, you really know how to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of yourself with your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly how often to hit that
bull, how hard to hit it, how many puffs
[SPEAKER_00]: to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know about every this often,
I need about this big of a dab to keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: body and my mind right where I want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's about an hour, about every
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want a pretty decent size chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, if I don't get my dab every hour,
I'm going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in an ideal world, if I just could
whip out the rig and pull a fat dab every
[SPEAKER_00]: hour, I'd take a decent dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's come down to about every
three or four hours because of stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: reality and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we understand how to dose
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to get a bottle that says
every six hours take one of these pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the dispensary and you get as
much as you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's time to take your medicine,
you take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your budget allows, unfortunately,
sorry, some folks aren't able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not in a medical state,
I guess that's not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one of the great things about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to die from it and you
get to learn your dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find your, I always say that my
first dab is medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first dab makes all the back pain go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my brain unscramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second dab, that might be,
that might be heavily medicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, that third dab, that's
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just having fun with the third one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just hanging out with Mike,
trying to talk some shit, trying to ramble
[SPEAKER_00]: into a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of rambling, let's get my high
ass back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Gramps, Richard Memo, thank you for
the great message, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about contributing to the
podcast while you are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microphones and podcast equipment are
replaceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your foot, your body and your life only
happen once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you take the best care of that
while you can and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be here when you're better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening to the show and get some
good flowers and just smoke on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the flowers don't get you nice and
medicated, maybe it's time to move up to
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if dabs aren't available in your area,
that's when we start playing with edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're eating edibles, I think you're
an experienced cannabis consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to say this one time,
go lightly and then work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot uneat those edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the milligrams are in you,
all you can do is ride that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a bigger dude, maybe 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Munch it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for some relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either going to feel it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about 45 to an hour and 15,
decide from there, do I need more or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe smoke a bowl at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a bowl and have that edible
in you, they're going to blend in
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to kick each other off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get the relief you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to have to experiment
with what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got a dispensary
around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're in a legal or a
medical state, but I'm sure you're a grown
[SPEAKER_00]: ass man and you can figure out how to get
the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you've got a good friend who's
got your back while you're on one foot and
[SPEAKER_00]: while your neck, your back, your neck and
your back are out of commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another email here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to trigger another
ramble fest because I do like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey there, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drowman80 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught your guest appearance on the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at the Dude
Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener found me through the Dude
Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not listening to the Dude Grow
Show, you better give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That show is available on Apple Podcasts
and any other qualified reputable podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: service.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Show is hosted by my
friend, The Dude, also hosted and or
[SPEAKER_00]: co-hosted by another good dude called
Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it is kind of technically led by
a guy known as Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of wonderful dudes behind
the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even begin to give all of them
shout outs, but they're great friends of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have made a lot of friends and
earned a lot of followers and fans through
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I always heard great things about
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I'm here in trim jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends in trim
jail sitting there at a table with some
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones on or with the Bluetooth
speaker just blasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the podcast going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all my trimmer friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for keeping those herbs looking
pretty, getting them to the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys to finish up our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect to the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody trolls you or picks on you for
being a trimmer, tell him Rasta Jeff said
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a badass trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to respect the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just have big furry buds without
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I got your podcast on while I'm
here in trim jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, you have me hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't per se have a question about
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my question is what got you into
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say what pitfalls did you
have upon your grow career?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did you use as motivation to keep
pushing forward when life didn't go as you
[SPEAKER_00]: planned?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, I'm going to
become a Patreon supporter within the
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious what you recommend from
your line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very dense nighttime potent as a high
calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Height isn't an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and respect from my brother from
another mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we share the same holy flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Droman80.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I read that kind of quickly,
but there's a lot to cover here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to become a Patreon
supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're asking about a strain
recommendation for nighttime, very potent
[SPEAKER_00]: and high calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were looking for liberation OG,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the strain I would recommend for
you from my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberation OG should be available at
SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, use coupon code GFYH10 to save
yourself a few bucks at SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really wasn't the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just plant that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the main part of this email
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, what got you into growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What got me into growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been around cannabis for as long as
I can remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a little kid, I can remember my
uncles and my family members just smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: a joint at a family gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a party, if there was an
event, if I went somewhere with my uncle,
[SPEAKER_00]: rest in peace to my uncle Eric,
but he would always be the one that made
[SPEAKER_00]: that face to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when your stoner friends just
look across the room and you make the big
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes or you shrug your shoulders and that
means, I think it's time to burn one,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you agree with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, everybody fucking agrees
because when my uncle Eric made that face,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knew it was time to go smoke a
fucking joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been around ganja or cannabis or
weed in some way, shape or form as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember about first grade,
approximately, that on the back patio of
[SPEAKER_00]: our little house, maybe a little
apartment, that we had one of those little
[SPEAKER_00]: wooden planter boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my uncles was teaching somebody
who lived at my house how to grow weed in
[SPEAKER_00]: those little planter boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure this was first grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to be about seven years old because
I remember the building in which we lived
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the backyard very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was about first grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was about seven years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my uncle and somebody else are
teaching each other how to grow weed in my
[SPEAKER_00]: little back patio there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on in the day, somebody was
telling somebody what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to chime in and say,
no, you're telling them wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember what Eric said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric said to do it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody looked at me like,
oh shit, little man's been paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of caught on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always loved the smell of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a little kid, but I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that when everybody hung out
and smoked weed, it was always chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew that when people drank,
I could see at a young age that when
[SPEAKER_00]: people drank, my family got fucking silly
and out of control when they would drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they would smoke, they'd all just
chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a much better vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I got older, I started watching
everybody else around me smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day, my buddy Chris was like,
you want to hit this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just acted like I'd been doing it
for a million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took a hit off of his pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's why everybody does
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was time for this shit to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure that I'd been getting
a contact buzz just being around my
[SPEAKER_00]: uncles, being in their cars, being in
their little, they had a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the stoner dudes have that
one room where they smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just let me hang out in the room
because I was a cool little kid and they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted me to be like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fucking am now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where I learned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually one day, my buddy Chris is
like, smoke this with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked and I loved smoking at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shortly after that, I moved to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to move to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family moved here, started kind of a,
they started a new business here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a new school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to establish all new friends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved to Colorado in the middle of
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was snowy and miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I got to do was meet my neighbor
across the street who took me to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I did was go to school every day
and then come home and then do my homework
[SPEAKER_00]: and go back to school because it was so
cold and shitty when I moved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hated it because I did not know how
to dress or how to survive in this cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also didn't know where to get any
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my neighbors in my neighborhood
definitely were not little smokers or
[SPEAKER_00]: stoners or weed heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were definitely more square folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I turned them into stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did not know where to get weed at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd been watching the kids at school
paying attention to who like might look
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're stoned or might smell like
they're stoned or whatever or might smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like they got some weed on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I joined a band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day we went camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when everybody was like,
hey, are you cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the coolest motherfucker you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we thought so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all busted out their weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a few other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked down and I missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started buying a lot of weed around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the people you could buy the herb
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, they weren't the most
reliable, responsible, friendly,
[SPEAKER_00]: honest people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your bag would not weigh even
fucking close to what it was supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: weigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started maybe buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wouldn't sell to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my friends were afraid to
approach some of these people because of
[SPEAKER_00]: their appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys have the good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that my friends were afraid of,
I know that they got the good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just hit them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I know I'm from California,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys always had the good weed in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys got the good weed out here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we got the good weed,
S.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I want to buy a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so first they sold me a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bought a lot of quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are like, you need to buy an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started buying a lot of ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all my friends were getting weed from
me because they wouldn't mess with those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, that's not our crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, I'm not worried about
those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go buy the herb from them and then
sell it to all the hips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go back to them and eventually as
doing larger quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by this point, I am deeply immersed in
the cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the statute of limitations has got to
be gone for all this because I'm on a good
[SPEAKER_00]: ramble, totally incriminating myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got deeply immersed into the
cannabis industry, the cannabis game,
[SPEAKER_00]: the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then through my music connections and
being in a band, I ended up moving to
[SPEAKER_00]: another state deeper into the Midwest from
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a choice that I made to be in this
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day while in this location,
I was at a friend's house and my eyes were
[SPEAKER_00]: hit by this really familiar light
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, whoa, what, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, oh, he's got a grow light up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point I had had a little bit
of experience helping other people run
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, but I'd never ran a garden by
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been around it since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I saw plants, I was just
enthusiastic and my friends would always
[SPEAKER_00]: want to show off and show me their grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd been in several grows and been
around it and I'd done a few little
[SPEAKER_00]: chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things, but I'd never really been
super hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the end of the evening,
I let everybody leave and I politely told
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy, I go, Hey, your metal halide
light hit me right in the face when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you saw my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, no dude, if you saw the
lights, maybe you can help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took me into his grow space and he
had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was quickly able to diagnose that
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was from being around the
plants when I was a little kid with my
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I learned how to identify that
problem from then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stuck in my head as like a seven
and eight year old kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we corrected my buddy's problem and
he's like, Hey, I've got to go out of town
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of days next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a surprise mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't know I had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need somebody to take care of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he leaves town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took care of his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out amazing, stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to stay gone longer than
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the dude came back, he was really
anxious to get to his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before we had all this internet
stuff where I could just send you a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture with my phone every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we would have been
comfortable doing that because of our
[SPEAKER_00]: location and because of the timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he came home and he was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, bro, my plants have never
looked this good before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me he would give me a little
bit of the crop for helping him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a nice portion of that crop for
helping him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I showed him how to trim even
better because I'd been a trimmer was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of, I think we all start off as trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start trimming and then you earn the
respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed that you could do it,
but I'd been trimming a lot by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed him how to trim real nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was proud of myself at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will fast forward several years
because this story is getting long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some friends who were trying to
open a dispensary in my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of great ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were older folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were missing a younger,
hipper element that could actually hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: street and put the word on the street that
there was a dispensary out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I could put some younger,
hipper vibes into the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started going to this place and it
was just an office where you would go in
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would consult with the weird guy
and he would recommend product and you
[SPEAKER_00]: would leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man quickly realized that I knew more
about cannabis than him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he asked me to transplant plants with
him the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize that that was
basically my application for becoming an
[SPEAKER_00]: employee with his dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hired me to be the first bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he hired me to be a helper in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I told him one day that we could
improve the grow by doing a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of laughed at me and I said,
no, it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he threw some plants at me and told me,
go home and show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to the store and bought a very
small setup and I built a very small grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grew product that was better
than his product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had been growing for quite a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved being around the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved being near the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got to take that product to the
dispensary and people would come into the
[SPEAKER_00]: store and they would buy the flowers that
I grew and they would take it home and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would smoke it and they would come
back two or three, maybe a week later and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would tell me, man, I smoked that
stuff that you grew and whatever pain was
[SPEAKER_00]: in my foot or in my back or in my neck or
my neck and my back, that pain went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first time I met these people,
they would look sad and in pain like their
[SPEAKER_00]: life wasn't as good as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grew a product that they smoked
it and they felt better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could put their cane away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend leave without his cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed up with his cane and we
medicated him so heavily that he got up
[SPEAKER_00]: and walked away and had to come back and
laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot my cane, dude, and he didn't
realize how profound that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you left your cane here because of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were able to stand up and walk away
and giggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd been a grouchy old fucker for
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's funny as shit that that old man
forgot his cane and giggled about it
[SPEAKER_00]: because he was a crotchety old dude and we
smoked him into oblivion and he smiled and
[SPEAKER_00]: he forgot that life sucked for him for a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was able to enjoy himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put away all that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forgot about his car wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forgot about his divorce.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forgot about his pain and suffering and
he enjoyed life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happened because of a product
that I took some time to nurture and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that nurturing of that plant nurtured
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel better for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slows my brain down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me forget about whatever is
hurting me, whatever is paining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I grow that and then I get to
smoke it with my friend and I get to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: him feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then imagine how many people I've smoked
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the only dispensary here in my city
for like two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how many people's lives I got to
touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to make their quality of life better
by growing a quality product and also by
[SPEAKER_00]: spending a moment with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a good bud tender then, you didn't
just, here's an eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as soon as you walk into my bud room,
how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew my people by first names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew about their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew why they were smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could ask, how's that foot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that broken foot feeling any better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sciatica healing up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember what I sold you last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it work for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then in the dispensary, we could
smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would oftentimes have a bowl or a
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say, hey, this is the new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a puff off of this and they'd smoke
it and you could immediately watch their
[SPEAKER_00]: pain or their anxiety just melt away a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, I'm rambling a lot because I
have a lot of passion for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I guess that is the bottom line of why
I got into this and why I started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was buying product from dispensaries and
buying products and it wasn't up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I could do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the owner and grower at this
dispensary challenged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, if you think you can do it as
good as me, go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that if I took my passion and my
education and some books and some time and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy that I could create an amazing
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have never looked back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked at improving my garden,
my grow knowledge, my grow skills every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm able to share on here is minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of stuff, but I just have to
be able to put it into a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned something every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that I have ever stopped
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what got me into growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing because of the demand
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like paying for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was challenged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said, you can't do it as good as
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say that to me, I kind of
have to show you that yes, I can,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it came to anything
involved in cannabis, because I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was a weed expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to just grow the best weed
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw little old ladies not feel like
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw athletes with broken knees able to
do athletic shit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw guys with mental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't form a complete sense,
able to calm down and have a conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually achieve a relationship and
have friends and girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a lot of great results from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what got me into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what kept me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one word, bro, the answer to that is
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry it took me 20 minutes to get to
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there is more to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What pitfalls did you have upon your grow
career?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did you use as motivation to keep
pushing forward when life didn't go as you
[SPEAKER_00]: planned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Life will never go as planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go kind of the way it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of foresee the future and try
to hope and prepare for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But life will never go as planned and
accepting that and being able to flow with
[SPEAKER_00]: that is one of the biggest challenges and
obstacles to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've accepted the fact that you
have zero control over this life,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have any control over tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any control over the other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you can really control is what you do
and what you put out and how you react and
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you accept that and understand that,
it is so much easier to just relax and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been a lot of pitfalls as a
cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always had to worry about
legalities, pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have driven up to houses that may
allegedly have had nine to 12 lights in
[SPEAKER_00]: that house and possibly somewhere between
75 to 100 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may have seen a bunch of red and
blue lights in front of that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just keep going like you don't
know that house even existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just drive right past it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I lose there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine to 12 lights, bulbs, ballasts,
hoods, fucking nutrients, equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring equipment, and also however many
fucking plants were in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that house is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in somebody else's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the utilities are in the homeowner's
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a rental.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just keep on driving allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that house is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the pitfalls of being a
cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it messes with relationships because
when cannabis was not legal to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to have alibis and stories of why
you've always got to go home every 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and water some fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have an alibi of why nobody can
come to your house because it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: a giant skunk and diesel fuel factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have alibis why nobody can
use their restroom because that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: the RO filter and all the water equipment
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a grower can mess up relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have an alibi of why you can't
hang out with anybody for like two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're trying to trim a crop and
you can't have anybody help you because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody knows about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to disappear and trim all
this shit and get it dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't ignore it because it's wet weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff messes up your mind,
your relationships, your scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you a little bit of
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you a little bit weird in your
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the major pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you've got the risks of getting
raided and all that sort of shit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of your mind at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pitfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a major pitfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that dispensary that I had
with a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was my assistant, Bud Tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was basically the manager and fucking I
ran that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day the city came in and they
said, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had established a very functional
business with standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures and flows and employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a lot of things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community was relying on us to supply
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was relying on that place for a
paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing a lot of things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly one day it was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a major pitfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had to reestablish themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: After being the major force of one
dispensary, no other dispensary would hire
[SPEAKER_00]: me because I was already attached to one
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all thought I was coming to sabotage
them or do something wrong when honestly I
[SPEAKER_00]: just needed employment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to reestablish and re-figure out
my life and figure out my position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no complaints or no problems
with that because I really think that that
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helped me move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think being stuck at that one
dispensary, being in that one position,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been in that one position
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have just ran that place and I
would still be there doing the same old
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that change encourages growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that that happened in a way,
but that was a major pitfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have my place of employment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have my place for community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't only where I sold cannabis,
where I worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was where I saw people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see the medical marijuana
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had such a nice community here that a
member of our medical marijuana community
[SPEAKER_00]: got in big trouble and had to go to court
and to show support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 30 to 50 members of our
medical marijuana community show up at his
[SPEAKER_00]: court case every single day to go show
support for this man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all people that came to our
dispensary that had all developed a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship as friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was what we were doing for the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to reinvent that around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to reestablish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have had a lot of great pitfalls in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a couple of great examples of
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had timers fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had equipment fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what do you use as motivation to
keep pushing forward when life didn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: as planned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it wasn't always easy to be as
positive and to stay motivated as it has
[SPEAKER_00]: become.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm a grown man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 40 years worth of experience to
look back and say, hey, shit's been worse
[SPEAKER_00]: than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had worse struggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had bigger problems than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't, you at least have more
skills and tools to understand how to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with the shit that's coming at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that I try to stay
positive by knowing I've been through
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I haven't been through this,
when I get through the other side of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the struggle is, I'm going to
have a lot more skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to know how to solve that
problem for next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that basically what doesn't
kill me makes me stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't keep learning every day,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't keep moving, every day,
all you're going to do is collect dust and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody needs to sit there and get dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just use every day as motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every mistake is motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have killed so many plants, some on
purpose, some on accident, but every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that I killed, I made sure to learn why I
killed it, how I killed it and how not to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that dumb shit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think every mistake, every pitfall,
instead of using it as, oh, I made a
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it as a whoops, probably shouldn't
do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to laugh at a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that can be frustrating to some
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just laughed at a major mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what do you want me to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip the table over and kick some shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you rather me laugh and go,
look how bad I fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've got a really serious
opportunity in life every day to laugh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to smile, to love, or you can kick some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be mad at some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just choose the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know what to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on a bad channel,
change the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point in life, what motivates
me and what keeps me going when life
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't go my way is knowing that life is
never going to go your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are millions of people on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't Google to find out how many.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so fucking many people on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we expect it to go all of
their way?
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us want the same shit,
maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to get laid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to eat some food, but maybe we
all want to get laid by the same person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just creates a problem right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we all get our own way?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we be so selfish to accept that
the world is going to go our way?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can set ourselves up for success in
small ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make our bubble function the way we
need it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just realizing and believing that I
can't control anything but me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes I don't even have full
control over that, that makes it so easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to just get over dumb shit and realize
that most of it is dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have had some struggles this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost an uncle who was very close to me,
but I am still here and I can't just let
[SPEAKER_00]: that kill me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to push on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to make him proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to make myself proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I miss my uncle and I love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish he was still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we could fucking smoke a joint and
go see a concert together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what can I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just got to live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to be stronger from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else in my life passes,
I'm a little bit stronger and I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more skill to deal with losing
somebody that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get stronger every single fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we can do.
