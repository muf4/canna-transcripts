Three, two, one, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 628 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.

grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend, Buzzards Bay Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been talking about what I'm
dabbing at the start of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am extra fast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm going super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm kind of rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to mention that I'm dabbing
something called Dirty Business from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Sour Diesel and OG Kush Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the jar here next to me to
give you the full details, but I do know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all fucked up from it and it's
delicious and I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to deal with me
going a little bit fast and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: rambly in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I did talk about
auto watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did the auto watering system,
I kind of overlooked a couple of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention auto pots and hempy
buckets and sips systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very affordable and very simple
ways to auto water our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any timers, any buttons,
any magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gravity fed, like I said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want an easier system that I
completely fucking overlooked,
[SPEAKER_00]: did not think about until my kind friends
reminded me, do a little research on auto
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The auto pot system is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill up one reservoir, run some lines
to other pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work on a, it's going to be,
I can't even think of the word right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a capillary system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows how moist the medium is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it needs more water, it gives it
more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, it turns it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hempy buckets kind of work on a
similar method.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what are known as sips systems,
sub irrigation planning systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub subterranean irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, obviously this is not my field
of expertise, but I had to remind you
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, had to tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to build your auto
water, watering system, looking for an
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable route and affordable
alternative, something very easy to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: something gravity fed, something very
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look into the hempy buckets, the auto
pots, something in that realm,
[SPEAKER_00]: a sips system is what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my update on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I want to talk about you
guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been scrolling social media when I'm
chilling out, trying to relax a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scroll just like you and I've been
seeing a lot of great things on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been seeing a lot of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that drives me crazy is I see a
lot of grow rooms, a lot of growth tents,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of grow environments that simply are
wasting a ton of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a five by five grow tent,
I would like to see at least four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of urban there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need one plant in a five by five,
one plant over here, one plant over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put those right under the center of
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them as much light as we can possibly
get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoil those two plants or even better,
let's fill the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a lot of places growing cannabis
is illegal and you're growing and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using your time, your manpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're committing a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to commit a fucking
felony, go in, fill that fucking room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't commit a felony for a little couple
of nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commit a fucking felony for a rewarding
fucking prize at the end, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is I see a five by five
tent with like one plant over here and one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit's a disorganized chaotic mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a five by five canopy,
a five by five tent, I'd like to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: five by five canopy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My tents, when I unzip the tent,
it just busts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a seventies bush busting out
of a bikini.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous when I open the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to see from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how to fill that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximize your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not get a five by five tent and put
three plants in there and have one super
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, one super short, one not even under
the fucking light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using the electricity, the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that costs money, time,
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, you're possibly
committing a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to commit a crime,
make it fucking worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felonies are not free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we used to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do your own felonies for free for
yourself either.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say, fill your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave you a cooler and I was like,
here's a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three feet by three feet by three
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put as much weed in there as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put two feet by two feet
worth of weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put fucking three by
three by three worth of weed in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fill it up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I said, fill it up with cookies or beer
or weed, whatever you want, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stack it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to stack that bitch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to just stack the middle
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a couple over here, a couple over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a commercial cannabis cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about efficiency, productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm used to packing the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a space, put some shit in that
space, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough ranting about space and
wasted space in your grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it a lot on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organize your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to commit a crime,
fucking commit a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough of the rambling intro part
of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of messages here that
are going to get me rambling on a focused
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you guys, those dabs of that dirty
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirty business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit got me high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking if I'm rambly, but that is
good for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Patriot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go too far on Patriot,
let's give a shout out to my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Skinny and mama skinny for supporting
us on Patriot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for being long time cannabis and
Patriot and grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re army supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been on the team for a long time,
been showing love for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to St. Skinny and mama
skinny, mama saint, however you want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the first question from
Patreon goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says Rasta Jeff, get your lab
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, what are the chances that an
industrial hemp farm would potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate and outdoor cannabis grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it even pollinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically in Colorado, the only
difference between cannabis and hemp is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got more than 0.03% THC,
your cannabis if you got less than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how we make strains of different
cannabinoid ratios is by breeding high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: to high CBD or other varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just breed those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you come out with different ratios,
different numbers of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how it's done, how the breeding
has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are the chances of industrial
hemp potentially potentially potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my new word.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the chances of industrial hemp
potentially pollination aling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see it right now, potentially
pollinating an outdoor cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it even cross-pollinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it absolutely would.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's kind of common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we had agricultural rules
that you couldn't set up a farm of a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain type within a certain amount of
kilometers of another farm of that same
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the cannabis industry came in,
we started building hemp farms and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody forgot about that guideline and
that rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've begun building cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grows and hemp grows and hemp farms
right on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of several people who have lost
cannabis crops and who have had hemp crops
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated due to stray pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that did happen last year that
messed up an entire outdoor hemp crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's outdoor hemp crop was
pollinated early by a cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their intention was to make outdoor
feminized hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit got destroyed by somebody else's
crop before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in litigation now finding out if
there's something, if that farmer who
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated on accident owes the farmer who
got pollinated something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that people do to try to
prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different kinds of trees and
plants we can set up as a barrier that
[SPEAKER_00]: will stop the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, that's how we get
different types of either hemp or
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pollinate that hemp, let's say you
got some CBD that's got like 20 or some
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp with like 20% CBD and cannabis with
20% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those cross, you're going to get
wildly, wildly varying different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we do to cross things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same plant to cross pollinate that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will continue to happen until people,
uh, learn the distancing rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I stress so much at outdoor
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I tell people how important it
is to find those male plants and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool that you're getting the seeds
out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to pollinate your garden,
but what about everybody in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is growing cannabis outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody for miles has potential to be
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen can go, I'm going to guess two
or three miles without being disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get that wind blowing that pollen
just right, it can go two or three miles,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you got some birds or some bees,
just like the pollinators are supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move pollen around quite far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they land on your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get pollen in their feathers or in
their bug fuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that shit's called on a
bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they get on their little bug legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bug flies around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to another cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just took that pollen to your,
from another crop over to your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pollinated your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's really, really important
that we pay attention to getting male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out of the outdoor garden as soon
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not only going to potentially
potentially there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word is again, you're not only
potentially going to fuck up your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you could mess up every grow for
miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the custom of dealing with that in
some States that have been growing outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pollinate my crop, I come get your
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I may come get your crop next
year and can't do shit about it because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't fucked up my crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how things work on the Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, uh, how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's grower justice out on the Hill
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck on my crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got bills to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not taking that my crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move forward from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one came from, Oh, you don't want
your name said, you are, uh, you know who
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just wrote down your name to give
you a shout out in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're around a lot and I do appreciate
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high and fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep on moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where does the next question go?
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question also came from,
uh, the email inbox from a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want their name said they
would rather be called used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, you've been cool the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're now, I'm just going to call you
cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, here is the message from cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you read this on your show,
do not use my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not reveal your identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, as you are one of the top
cannabis breeders in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will accept that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give it to me, never tried
to get that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't know that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's hear some feedback on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I thought you would be the person
to ask about this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some time ago, I had wanted to obtain bog
seeds, blue Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bushy old growers, blue Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were sold out as that strain
quite often is sold out because that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad ass strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I periodically checked for a
restock, but then, as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bushy old grower from bog seeds passed
away suddenly making the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting bog seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once bog died, the prices off all of his
seeds increased astronomically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully some of those proceeds are going
to Mrs. Bog because she is still around
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do need to support and take care of
a lovely lady who does not have her
[SPEAKER_00]: husband around the head of household,
the fucking breadwinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully some of those, uh,
markups and auctions are going to Mrs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, those seeds are now hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I decided to make one last check
a few weeks ago and seeds here now.com had
[SPEAKER_00]: a few packs in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to interrupt myself and do a
quick apology disclaimer for seeds here
[SPEAKER_00]: now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a spring cleaning of their
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they did the spring cleaning,
they discovered a couple of tech issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of my business to air their
business, but they had some tech issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were rebuilding the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took them longer than expected and
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting their shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If by the time this episode comes out,
they should have their shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to apologize for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they were doing was updating their
system to give you as a customer,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most streamlined experience you could
possibly have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a couple of days they were down,
but it was to improve service for you as
[SPEAKER_00]: the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the idea was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, while they were doing that,
they did an inventory and they discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of packs that were in inventory that
were not on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things were on a vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things were on a stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some things got discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have been put on the inventory at
seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's some shit you've been
looking for, uh, that you thought you
[SPEAKER_00]: might've missed, like our friend used to
be cool here, found some bog seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some thug pug stuff that went
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been trying to look at seeds
here now.com and you've been getting an
[SPEAKER_00]: error message or something was wrong at
the website, be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's not back now, keep being
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try, I promise you, you can trust me,
it will be worth your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just coming back, checking it out,
give us another shot, give them another
[SPEAKER_00]: shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything they did was to improve the
service for you on your shopping end,
[SPEAKER_00]: on your receiving end, make it better for
you as the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the disclaimer for seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I cover two things, check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they did some website updates,
also restocks on a lot of old gear that
[SPEAKER_00]: was sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to get myself back here into
this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it made me think about making
blue Kush seeds to preserve it for my
[SPEAKER_00]: future use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got some seeds and you love
them so much that you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to preserve this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I do this again?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I make more?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what turns growers into breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, however, I realized I'm
ignorant about making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I don't mean that I
don't know that a male plant pollinates a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant, but since I've got limited
space, I'm going to need to return my
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated female to my flower tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend has a basic understanding of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows that a male and a female make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the basic idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows he's going to make F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dilemma that our friend used to be
cool is running into here is once they
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate this plant, it will need to be
returned to the flowering room so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can continue to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to want to pollinate the
entire grow because he does need some
[SPEAKER_00]: usable medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of things about
this, but I'm going to continue with the
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: My questions are, how long does it take
for pollen to impregnate a female?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the pollen is immediately accepted
by the female, can I then spray that said
[SPEAKER_00]: female with water to kill any remaining
pollen and safely place her back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you think I would benefit from
any other information to help advance my
[SPEAKER_00]: plan, I would appreciate the input.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give you some guidance and
information here in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know you've been very busy and
swamped with questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I love getting back to you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never feel stressed about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had these seeds for several months,
but because of unforeseen circumstances,
[SPEAKER_00]: my schedule was delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's behind schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow is off schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, uh, thank you for all you do
for the community, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the continued feedback and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they wrap it up with used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your breeding questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, you've obviously got a male
plant somewhere that's producing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know where that male plant is
because if it's not in your main flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: space, you've got it somewhere in a 12,
12 cycle producing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do in an ideal world is I
would put that female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would move it in there with that male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would leave it in there for just a day,
you know, just put it in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: knock it, uh, let that male plant dust it
real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that pollen be accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would just leave it in that room or
I would put it in a veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you would pollinate this plant
and give it two to three days,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe five to seven days at the most,
just to make sure that it's impregnated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then I would move that plant back
into a veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's already got pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the bud sites that are going to
receive pollen have been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magic has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're no longer looking to make flowers or
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're focused on making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you move that plant back into a veg
room under 18, six, uh, it will continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been impregnated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its whole goal now is to finish those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a veg room, you can move
that plant into the veg area or leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room where you just pollinated
where that male plant is and put that
[SPEAKER_00]: light on the veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got that extra
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just my main idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put it back into the vegetative
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in the veg room can't get
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the seeds will, uh, mature more
quickly in a vegetative room because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting more photons, more light
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're not focused on flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant that you have pollinated will
continue to produce those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, it will revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have that plant will be
seeded, filled with viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will begin to make clones that you
can cut off of there to make another
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant to again, preserve that
original mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, if you have the room, I would put it
into a vegetative space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read because there was something
that got my attention here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought of an idea that I wanted to
read to tell you, um, yeah, I think you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of what the part that left
my head was, but I would just put it back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the vegetative space or, um,
pollinate it, leave it in that flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave it in there for,
in the dark, if you need to, after it
[SPEAKER_00]: receives the pollen, it can sit in that
dark space for like 24, 48 hours in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get too angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take that plant out of there,
spray that plant down with water because
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen at this point has been
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray yourself down with water,
spray the other girls down with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can put it back in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got four or five seeds of all
of those also crossed to the blue Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's what you did on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's not a bad deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do want all those seedless,
but, uh, that's going to be the worst case
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that left my brain, it just came
back as I paused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you could really do that I,
as a breeder who I run seeded crops most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the time in my grow spaces,
but I also like to do a non seeded crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a test run of new stuff that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I have something to smoke on
that's not seeded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could try new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can write strain reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can select phenotypes and keepers and
move forward with projects, but I stagger
[SPEAKER_00]: my grows to where these are so far into
flower that they can't receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are so early into flower that
they can't receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my target plant is right at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one crop that's going to get
seeded and one crop that's almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another crop that's about to go
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just all about timing at that
point, stagger them to where one is too
[SPEAKER_00]: far ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've probably got one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably got a flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got a veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, um, I'm confused on what you've
got because you've got another space with
[SPEAKER_00]: a male plant that's in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have another space with that
boy that's in flower because if the boy is
[SPEAKER_00]: in with the girls, all of your girls are
going to get seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming there's a boy space
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that boy, go in, get him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put the girl right in there with
that boy the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let them share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could put that girl in there when
the pollination time is perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just sacrifice that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've cut down the mail,
cleaned him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave that girl in there for a
little while until you feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen has been absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say just a few days, uh, two to three
days at the most five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's pregnant like a few seconds after
you pollinate it, but, um, leave it in
[SPEAKER_00]: that other space and then move it to the
veg room under 18 six, or then move it
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the other flower room,
but treat it with water, maybe treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with water a couple of times, you know,
let it, receive the pollen, let it sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of days, hit it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let the lights fucking cycle,
hit it with water again, move it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the other room, hit those bitches in that
room with water, spray yourself down also,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that pollen is going to get
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've given you the right idea
either put the plant in the space where
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail was after you pollinate it,
put the plant in the veg space after you
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate it, or very carefully spray
everything down and put it back into that
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your other option is to stagger your
crops, which I know is kind of a pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to make as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fill that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just said, but sometimes you got to
make a little space just for that one
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated pregnant girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pregnant girls are always special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to treat them special,
give them their own space, do special
[SPEAKER_00]: things, special arrangements for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
