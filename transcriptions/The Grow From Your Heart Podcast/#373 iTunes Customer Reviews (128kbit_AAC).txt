[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 373 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of spoiling myself today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a jar of pre-98 Bubba Kush batter
that just smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromas coming out of this jar are
earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a hint of feet and a hint of
fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely just smells exactly what
you would expect pre-98 Bubba Kush to
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful run of pre-98 Bubba
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the batter of pre-98 Bubba
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took some of the internally
flawless diamonds and I put a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks of the IFS diamonds right into the
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a pretty chunky sized dab of
the batter with a couple of nice chunks of
[SPEAKER_00]: the IFS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took that and I rubbed it around in
some of these Stardog fambrosia turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a fambrosia jar, it's a four
gram jar of the ambrosia, they give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice portion of the crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HCFSE, the high cannabinoid full
spectrum extract crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also get a bunch of the HT,
the high terpene full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce at the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I quite often have a lot of
that turp sauce left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the battery dab that has the
crystals in it and I just used it as a mop
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of sweep up some of those leftover
Stardog turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives me this pre-98 Bubba Kush
battery base with a big internally
[SPEAKER_00]: flawless diamond sprinkled on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internally flawless series diamonds,
by the way, are, let's see what the label
[SPEAKER_00]: says here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This says 82.5% THC and a total of 94%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These look like little, kind of look like
ice cubes or diamonds in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are internally flawless diamonds and
they are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have much flavor, but they do
pack a serious punch with potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chisel off a little bit of the
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix that up into the batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the batter more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also adds some flavor to those diamonds
because they don't have a lot of flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I mop up that Stardog turp with that
little concoction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Stardog turps absorb right into that
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch it all just become one nice
little puddle in my giant dabber,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically a shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, and the high from this dab,
you guys, is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, when it hits you,
you get a blast of Stardog turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gassy, it is fuely, it is funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hint of maybe some sort of
candied fruit in the background,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a very faint hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as it hits your tongue
real well, that pre-98 Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: earthiness just takes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this fuely, earthy,
beautiful, savory flavor on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then before you even start exhaling,
before you start blowing out that fat dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: I start feeling the Stardog get right in
the middle of my brain and start making my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, and it makes my eyes go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah, here comes something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I feel that pre-98 Bubba Kush
rest across my shoulders and it just says,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of, you know, when somebody
comes up from behind you and they give you
[SPEAKER_00]: that little rub on the shoulders,
the two thumbs right there in those little
[SPEAKER_00]: sore spots in the back of your shoulders,
they push their fingers into your little
[SPEAKER_00]: neck muscles right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it feels like the pre-98 Bubba Kush
just comes up and gives you one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet massages, just like a little rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your head's all high from the
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you slowly feel the pre-98 Bubba
Kush work its way down your spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It relaxes your back, your spine,
your muscles, your whole body just starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to chill out and it feels really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Stardog makes your brain go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-98 Bubba Kush hits the body
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get that beautiful taste of
the Stardog and the beautiful flavor of
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of coffee, earthy pre-98.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of lingers on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a beautiful cotton mouth with
such a great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really great combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it lasts super long because I'm
putting that IFS diamond in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pumping a lot of THC into my body
all in one big hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a really great rush, a really
great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about it, while I was talking
about it, I was actually kind of building
[SPEAKER_00]: myself a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't dab on the podcast,
but let's take a dab together on this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is not going to be a grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I plan to talk about my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to talk about iTunes and Stitcher
and Google Play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we're going to read some iTunes
customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how much time we've got after
that, we may jump into some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may just ramble a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, let's take a dab
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got everything I need for a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a fat dab prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to take this dab
and not bump the rig on the microphone and
[SPEAKER_00]: not do anything ridiculous like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may catch a couple of seconds of
silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's going to happen when I
start heating the nail with the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The torch may make the recording equipment
go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me adjust a knob here on the
compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may help us out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's going to happen when
the torch comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it doesn't sound too bad in the
headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it doesn't sound like shit to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I keep talking, it will cut out
the noise of that torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only have to go for a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are taking a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are about to smoke
something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're hanging out with somebody
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a good day going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're not stuck in a cubicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are, this dab is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, I'm going to take a big old fat
dab for you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just heating up this nail nice and
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just letting it get hot, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will all be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cleaning it off a little bit while I
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still got a little crusty from the
last dab I took.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's hot enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hit a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give it a countdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get to the right time,
we will take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to wait about 50 seconds with as
much heat as I put on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, I could talk away for 50 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't feel like a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But suddenly, since I have 50 seconds of
time to cover, I don't have anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys would like to support the show
on Patreon, I would truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do so by going to patreon.com
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was almost 20 seconds worth of
talking right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't take much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're getting closer to dab time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I hope you're going to dab with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a big old dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might go a little hotter than
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move this mic out of my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might have been more of a dab than I
needed for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am well-medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some serious cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: My shoulders are nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're going slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe I should have brought a
pillow for this part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to try to keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a few days, my website was broken as
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony fixed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're trying to visit the
website, if you're trying to visit the
[SPEAKER_00]: store, those things are back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now check out the website,
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also check out the iReStore while
you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grab yourself a t-shirt or a
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are iReGenetics t-shirts and hoodies
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also Grow From Your Heart
podcast t-shirts and hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brand new iRe Army t-shirt plus a
nice line of stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to visit the store,
if you're trying to do some Black Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping or some Christmas shopping,
I apologize that the website was down over
[SPEAKER_00]: that holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is fixed and it is back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the website is fixed,
that means that Stitcher and iTunes are
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were missing the show on iTunes and
or Stitcher, now all of the episodes are
[SPEAKER_00]: uploading properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are able to go listen on your favorite
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I added the podcast to Google Play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get the podcast out there as
much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought throwing it in Google Play
would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Play gives me a lot of good
analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be able to watch that over the
next month and we'll see how many people
[SPEAKER_00]: listen over Google Play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget that the podcast is
always forever available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single episode is available on the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it by searching for the Grow
From Your Heart podcast on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is most of the important
business that I need to cover at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some iTunes customer
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: These reviews come from the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening on an iPad or an
iPhone and you would like to leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: review, it is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up the podcast app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the current episodes and keep
scrolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll right past the current episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will show you the best of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will see ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a button that says write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply click on that button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will give you the option to give
me a rating of one through five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me as many stars as you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've clicked the appropriate amount
of stars, you can type in your customer
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the show
and I will read your review on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into some of these most recent
customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on November 11th.
[SPEAKER_00]: By a guy who calls himself Tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tall Clint gave us five stars and he says,
I enjoy the show and I'm glad that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: turned my friends in the cannabis and hemp
industries onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work and then he signed
it from Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Clint, thanks for listening to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review and then also
thanks for turning your friends onto my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it and word of mouth is a
great way to spread a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we know who Clint is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint has been on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is my bro so big thanks to Clint for
all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may put Clint back on the podcast here
in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this next customer review was
left on October 1st and it was left by a
[SPEAKER_00]: person who calls themselves Happy Atheist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is most knowledgeable
marijuana podcast out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stumbled upon this podcast a couple of
weeks ago and I listen to past episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is extremely knowledgeable
about the topics he discusses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get a ton of helpful info and a
good laugh while listening to him talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Happy Atheist, thank you for listening
to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great review and thank
you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you share the show like Clint did
and then I like that you said Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: is extremely knowledgeable about the
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do a little bit of research
before I go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to know what I'm talking about and
if I don't know a topic, I am happier just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying I don't know than trying to fake my
way through it and teaching you some
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that I am extremely
knowledgeable about the topics I choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you said that you get a good laugh
out of listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot because I think it's much
easier to learn when you can laugh and
[SPEAKER_00]: have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to school, I was not a very
good student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of teachers that actually
went out of their way to educate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They realized that I was a smart kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't like learning the way most
other kids learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a few teachers that did step out
of their comfort zone and actually educate
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, it just felt like I
was being force fed some information so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could pass a test to make the
teachers look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't really teaching me anything
that I needed to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here teaching something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how I hated learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated being force fed information in a
condescending tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like if we laugh and if we have
a good time and if we appreciate each
[SPEAKER_00]: other, I think you guys really learn a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I kind of I feel like I repeat
myself and I reiterate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, but that's because people learn
in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I can say the same thing three
or four different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first three times I said it,
a certain person may not get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that fourth time, I may just word
it just in a different order and it may
[SPEAKER_00]: all make sense to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's why I kind of repeat myself a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, that's why I tell a few jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I try to keep it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a super serious uptight guy when
it comes to learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we all can learn better if we
can relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let your guard down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smile a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to learn more from your friends
than some asshole preaching at you and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you a lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that I know what
I'm talking about and I've taken some time
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually understand what I'm trying to
teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, thank you for noticing that I'm
trying to have a good time and keep it fun
[SPEAKER_00]: while educating all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this next iTunes customer
review comes from a person who calls
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves DaddyO45.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of the review says,
love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they gave us a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left this review on September 30th
and the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your show hits my ear just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the tone and flow of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad the show hits your ear just
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a musician, being kind of an
audiophile, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those few words in a row right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your show hits my ear just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I've got all the knobs dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I've got all the equipment just
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me because I spent a
lot of time dialing in the sound and
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that it sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't listen to a podcast with poor
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already starting off with a great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you love the tone and flow of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I'm trying to have
fun while educating and keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you are always learning
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, trust me, I will keep up the
good work as long as you guys keep
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great review,
DaddyO45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the next review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of this one is Stay Iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy says, I couldn't be happier that I
stumbled upon this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material is new and engaging weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The personal touch he gives is top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to learning is being able to
relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your vivid descriptions and examples,
we are all able to relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are helping to eradicate the stigma
surrounding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me that I am hitting my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals when I started this show
was to help eradicate the stigma around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, part of the intro used to
say if you're a new smoker, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: new grower, if you're a cannabis activist
or if you're someone who's just curious,
[SPEAKER_00]: about the current state of cannabis,
I said that because I want everybody to
[SPEAKER_00]: relate to this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you as a professional grower or you
as a heavy consumer to be able to listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to this podcast with your mom or your
grandma and say, hey, listen, this guy is
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks fairly well and he smokes a ton
of cannabis and listen to the things he
[SPEAKER_00]: says.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's representing this plant in a positive
light and he's taking the fear out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part of my mission when I
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I try to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bragged a while back that I have not
missed a Monday in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a technical glitch in the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did technically miss a Monday,
but I had a recorded episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just would not make it to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say I didn't miss a
Monday, but I try to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think consistency is key when it comes
to podcasting and developing an audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material is new and engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is a lot of information to talk
about when it comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will never run out of growing info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will always have new and engaging
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The personal touch just comes naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good time wherever I am,
whatever I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always going to get a little bit
of Rasta Jeff flavor no matter what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing a podcast, if I'm doing a
YouTube video, if I'm doing a seminar,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm doing some consulting, you always
get a little bit of Rasta Jeff personality
[SPEAKER_00]: in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes when you're
working with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad we're kind of connecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I'm making friends through
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I meet you guys at events and things,
you'll walk up to me and you'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I'm T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homi or Tommy, however I'm supposed to say
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, hey, I'm Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be like, oh, dude,
I almost know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we've been hanging out
because we've corresponded so much through
[SPEAKER_00]: messages and I've read your reviews and
you know so much about me because I spill
[SPEAKER_00]: it all out right here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels like we've already broken the
ice and we can just hang out when we meet
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we're connecting on that sort of
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we're able to relate,
which is the next word that you use in
[SPEAKER_00]: your review here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad we're able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go on to say that my vivid
descriptions and examples make it easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone to relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am obviously hitting my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to see a theme here in these
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: These reviews tell me that I am hitting my
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are able to relate with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're having fun and you are learning and
we are dispelling the stigma around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Tommy, thank you for the great
review, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more iTunes customer review
and it comes from a person who calls
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves iDead420.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of the review is great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they left five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left this review on September 19th
and the review is short and sweet and it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best cannabis podcast I have listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you used the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not out for any sort of competition or
anything, but if you feel it's the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes me proud and that makes me
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support and thank you
for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want to thank everybody for
the great iTunes customer review.

your first option is to give me an amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, $100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 62 people have given me five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: One Sour Puss gave me a one star and
another slightly less Sour Puss gave me a
[SPEAKER_00]: two star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so far we're doing really well in the
ratings department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again to everybody who has left an
iTunes customer review and a five star
[SPEAKER_00]: rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start wrapping up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this was a little bit short,
but it is a Thursday bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been putting out a lot of content
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been fighting off this little
head cold and a throat thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to push my voice too hard
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get these iTunes customer
reviews out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going out of town for a couple of
days, so I wanted to get a nice sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday episode ready for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go, I just want to remind you
guys, it gets rough out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be nice to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that even though you're busy
and it's cold and life is hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: still got to be fucking nice to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, simple shit goes a long way,
especially around this time of year.
