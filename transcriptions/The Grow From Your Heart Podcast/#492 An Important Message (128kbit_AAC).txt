[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quick Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to wish everybody a happy
holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I sat down to record, I was told
that there was a death in my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am really not in the mood or in the
right mind to record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to come on here and thank
everybody for all of the support that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've shown to the podcast and wish
everybody a happy holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do that very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy holidays, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there was a death in my
family and I've got a lot to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be distracted from the
podcast momentarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be away from social media for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take good care of my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get my head right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be away for a funeral here very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need a moment to regroup and handle
my family and handle my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will be back with quality
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a better holiday episode for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a better message for you
other than happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys go spend some time with the
people you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them you love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't going to be around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it fucking hurts when they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go spend some time with people you
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go be around people you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go eat some good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to get a Monday episode
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make no promises on that Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't missed a Monday in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels really weird to think about even
missing a Monday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got a lot more stuff to deal with
right now than a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back as soon as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it together and I'll have fresh new
content for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have that mix episode written.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great content written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be a struggle to
produce an episode for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, take great care
of yourselves, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
I'll see you guys next time.
