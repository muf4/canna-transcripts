[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 276 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a frosty cold night here in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are nice and warm or maybe nice
and chill wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What time of year it is, wherever you are,
wherever you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're having a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also hope you got a big fat dab lined
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got a big fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got the bong loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got a blunt rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got something going on so you can get
medicated with me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show off by telling
everybody what I have been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me reach over here and turn down this
music just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I have been smoking on some
Clementine live resin batter and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the dabs of Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it on the dabber and I've got this
Gotham high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the crystals, the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to stick that to the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just push a little to the side and
then I stick the Clementine dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: dab on the dabber and then I dip that like
a paintbrush into the crystals and just
[SPEAKER_00]: pick up enough kind of like just to season
a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Gotham crystals of course
test at 96 or 98% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's 96% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Clementine gives you a great
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do a lot for me to get me high,
but the flavor is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those Gotham crystals, they really put
you in another place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Clementine makes it taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gotham gets me super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's got me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're as lit up as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been trying to be a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to buy cheap hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the hash that I smoke and I'm not
trying to brag or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just telling you something that I
realized lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash that I smoke from most of the
time, the live resins and the batters,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where you go, some places
have sales, some places have specials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run you somewhere between
usually 35 and 50, maybe $60 a gram for
three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top shelf super quality hash,
the Hyken Abanoid full spectrum extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to some places, it'll be $40 a
gram, maybe $35 a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can find it on sale for a
little bit cheaper, but not much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on the recreational side,
it's going to be harder to find and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to be $50 or $60,
maybe $70 or $80 a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't shop on the recreational side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a medical marijuana card,
but I know it's way more expensive on that
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is, I was trying to be
a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking too much of this
expensive hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, what if I go to a dispensary
and I buy some of this cheap hash they're
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a shop advertising 10 and $15
grams of shatter and $15 grams of live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, I should go check this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to say any strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any brand names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any dispensary names,
but I did a little bit of shopping just to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there was anything out there
affordable so that I didn't have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: buying these $40 and $50 grams and dabbing
them all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm just going to go get some
cheap shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can take some big old fat
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep moving because there's
something about a big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take a hundred little dabs and not
get as much effect as I would off of from
[SPEAKER_00]: one big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a big dab, just something about
the head rush, the lung expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to be able to take a big dab
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to go find some cheap shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was being a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some $10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're acceptable for $10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been mad if it was a 15 or
$20 gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some $15 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exactly what you would expect from
a $15 gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made from trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell that the material was kind of
dry and old because it tastes like Keith
[SPEAKER_00]: and it smells like dusty Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these cheap grams, they get me
high, but I got to smoke a lot of it to
[SPEAKER_00]: get any effect from it, like a quarter or
a half of the gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it was cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my complaint is that all of this cheap
hash kind of tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather pay the extra funds and not
have to make this face after I take my
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and smoke my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be enjoyable when I take
a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to taste like pesticides
or nutrients or funk or mold or shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be, ooh, that was orangey and
delicious, or, ooh, that was lemony,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, ooh, that tastes like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these cheap dabs,
they kind of just taste like boo boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because, my theory is that it's
because everybody's making high
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid full spectrum extracts,
live resins, batters, butters,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other fancy hashes, and the
shatter is made from the lowest,
[SPEAKER_00]: cheapest quality trim in most situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak for every place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that at The Grow Eye Run,
we are very picky about the trim that we
[SPEAKER_00]: send out to where actually an extraction
company sent us an email saying that they
[SPEAKER_00]: get more returns and highest tests off of
our hash material because we pick through
[SPEAKER_00]: it and clean out the shit leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make hash out of the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of popcorn butt in there
that gives it better quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't spray with any funky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mostly switching all the way over to
predator bugs, so there's no spray on our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all predator, so the plants don't
taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these other places I'm
shopping, some of the other extractions,
[SPEAKER_00]: it tastes terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're using the bottom quality
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're probably using problematic
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A joke that I used to make when hash
started getting real popular, getting like
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO, my joke was now that we know how to
make BHO, nobody gets powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of the powdery mildew
buds that people grow in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have huge powdery mildew
problems in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to control the indoor
environment when the outdoor environment
[SPEAKER_00]: changes 30 degrees from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was eight degrees when I got to work at
eight o'clock today, and it was 32 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: when I went to lunch at noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's probably back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably back down in like the 16,
15 degree area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to adjust your HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get shit dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does create a lot of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that a lot of the products
that I bought for cheap were powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some sort of pesticide ridden buds that
people just had to get rid of on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at, and I know I've just
been ranting for a long time, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what the fuck's your point here?
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, remember back in the day when
you had the choice of buying what they
[SPEAKER_00]: called schwagweed or commercial weed,
or you could buy, people called it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, or there were different words,
but there was shitweed and goodweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always the guy trying to convince my
friends, quit buying that shitweed and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: the goodweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory is that if I took a gram of,
and I'm just going to be hypothetical with
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took a gram of $15 hash and I took a
gram of $45 hash, I think the $45 gram
[SPEAKER_00]: lasts me three times as long and gets me
three times as medicated and it tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: three times better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I learned my lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried, I spent a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't waste it because I got some
medicine, but you should have seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: face I made after I took a couple of these
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them tastes like fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them kind of tastes like broccoli
or Brussels sprouts or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I learned my lesson,
quit trying to be a cheap ass and quit
[SPEAKER_00]: buying the cheapest concentrates I can buy
and stick with what I know and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something else that I was going to
mention is it seems like shatter is being
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed out of the market so that they can
make space for all of the fancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the acronym concentrates, the high
cannabinoid, full spectrum extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: the high terpene, full spectrum extracts,
the batters, the butters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course some places are carrying
rosins, but I see shatter kind of becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the old school stuff, like how a
lot of us look at the bubble hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, like the old hash that
the old guys smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at it like that's hash old guys
smoke pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what shatter is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be an old guy smoking
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting to me the way
things come and go from this industry so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before it was legal, it took a long
time for things to evolve and travel
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world and around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were doing, if you're doing dabs in
California before the internet and before
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, it would have taken years
for people in New York to catch on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do dabs the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with legalization in place,
now with the internet, you could do a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: in California on Facebook Live and teach
your buddy in New York exactly how to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys can teach each other the same
lingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're saying the same shit on
both coasts, both doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this new shit is just across the
country instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with legalization, we're able to
do so much more learning, so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, so much more R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have R&D'd ourselves up to the top
with these crystals, with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: batters and butters to where we have R&D'd
ourselves so quickly that shatter is
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming an antiquity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2010, 2011, maybe 2009 when
I took my first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first dab out of a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you where that was in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first time anybody gave me any BHO
was a friend of mine just gave me a little
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of parchment with some stuff folded
in it and a little sappy stuff folded up
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, give that a hit when you
get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went home and I scraped it into a
brand new pipe that had never been smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just put it on the bowl and I just
lit that shit up and gave it a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was supposed to go somewhere and
wherever I was supposed to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember just texting them, I'm going to
be late because I just laid face down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, holy shit, I was so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't been that high that instantly
high that fast because I went from I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't smoked all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get high to oh, shit,
I need a nap and some food and maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoons like just instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first time smoking
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was I'm going to say that was not
smoking concentrates, smoking BHO made
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that was 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008 or 2009 because of the person that
gave it to me and where I was and how we
[SPEAKER_00]: were associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved with Metamar, the
dispensary at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I met the guy and I'm
pretty sure that's where I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like 2008, 2009 is probably when
I started smoking BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tell you about my first real
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the Denver High Times medical
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to put medical in there at the
Cannabis Cup, the High Times Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: in Denver at the Exto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Broadway Wellness booth had a
booth set up and they were giving out
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Daniel Desai, also known as Big D from
Top Shelf Extracts was giving out dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had talked to him online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had corresponded through Facebook a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never met in person and we saw each
other's faces and I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the guy from the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, dude, you're the guy from
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I walked up and got in line and took a
dab and we introduced each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bought a dab rig from Dan that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually one of the old school
swing arm skillets, but I stood in line
[SPEAKER_00]: and I went up and I got my turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab and I was like, man,
that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, it's this kind of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me, I don't remember what he
said, but I was like, I'm going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back and buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of looked at me like,
yep, I bet you will, cause you look like
[SPEAKER_00]: you really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought about it for the next
couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, should I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck, I can't even quit
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and bought my first dab rig and
I still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have the skillet and I still have
the little dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it a coughless bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a real, it's a beaker style
bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little beaker base and it's
just real tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make you cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I brought that home and I smoked dabs
with a little Kev and Pops and Tony and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably Mike and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember who else was there,
but I remember we all took our first,
[SPEAKER_00]: they took their first dabs in my basement,
doing it that 70's show style down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement, getting stoned back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everybody went home and took a
nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I called everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I texted everybody like four hours later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, I just fucking woke
up from a nap, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that that was like 2010 or 2011
when that first high times cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_00]: came to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the medical one that wasn't
recreational is before we allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the amount of time it's now
2000, barely 2018 dabs lasted shatter
[SPEAKER_00]: lasted like eight years before it started
becoming the old school shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the rage for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like the, yeah, maybe we'll
smoke some shatter if you got some,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'd rather smoke all this other shit
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really neat how it's evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've predicted, and I don't know how long
this will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we'll actually see this,
but I think that eventually you'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to, maybe it'll be like a Budtender
slash pharmacist slash Coke dispenser
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be like, oh, I like,
I like this much THC, this much CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: this much CBG, this much CBN for my
cannabinoid ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for my terpenes, I like this much
terpenolene, this much pineal,
[SPEAKER_00]: this much, whichever turp I'm going to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your Budtender or your pharmacist
or the machine that you're pressing the
[SPEAKER_00]: buttons on and ordering everything from,
cause it's the future and everything will
[SPEAKER_00]: be automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just type in your ratios and it
basically has a bunch of, it's got those
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients in the back and it whips them
up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it spits it out like a Coke machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, here's your grandma
concentrate custom tailored for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly mixed up so that every time
you take a dab, you get that perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: this much THC, this much CBD, CBG,
CBN, whichever cannabinoids you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the perfect ratio and amount of
terpenes to where that it tastes perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those terpenoids work with the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be your perfect tailored mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll, you'll have a USB card that
you can stick into a machine and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: bring up your options that you've bought
before so that you can have your different
[SPEAKER_00]: variety mixes saved on that USB card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just stick USB in and it goes,
oh, you need mix number 3,752.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll spit it out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can just save it on a USB.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've always got your mix right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it never changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something, not exactly,
but that's sort of what I see coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to custom tailor your own
concentrate for your own needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of mix do you think you would
make?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should tweet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me at GFYHpodcast on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me a Facebook message or you
can email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you can make up your own
custom mix, what would you make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what percentage of which
cannabinoid and terpenoids you would put
[SPEAKER_00]: in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably make myself a really high
THC mix with a lot of limonene and lemony
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be terpenoline and limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really candy, lemony flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a hint of orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe like some pineapple in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oranges, lemons, pineapples would be
really like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be super high THC and it would just
make my head spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would have another one that had
like a real cushy chem flavor and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: have something in there would make me just
want to be chilled out, kind of sedated,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lazy, maybe kind of creative,
maybe a little bit giggly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would have two different opposite
kinds of ends of the spectrum for my
[SPEAKER_00]: custom tailored concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just big hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long time in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see that day and I hope you guys
are there with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that was a long, fun rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dabs must be working, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something more cannabis
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a breeding update, you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep telling you about the breeding
update that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, of course, am breeding with my male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's golden goat crossed a daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned previously on the show that
around Christmas time or around the new
[SPEAKER_00]: year, I would be pollinating and the
pollination has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are all filled with pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are starting to get hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're large and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyxes are getting swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're obviously seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistils have curled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are bright, bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistils are bright red and the
trichomes are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look at the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we are recording on ... Why can't I
find the date anywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is the 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're recording on January 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that those plants have been
into flower for about 36 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they need about 25 more
days-ish to finish up and then those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: should be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted one or two pictures to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following me on Instagram,
you should check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ire, I-R-I-E, underscore
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S, iregenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out my cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about the Durban poison
crossed to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, I feel like that's going
to be a really good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of potential in mating those
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the star dog, I feel like that's
going to be an amazing cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, platinum tangy is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that's just going to make big
spears that smell like oranges and candy
[SPEAKER_00]: and are just coated in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy is already a great
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of small and I want to make
it bigger and I want to make something of
[SPEAKER_00]: my own that has that orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to add that orange to my lineup
because I love orange flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about those three
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be finished up here toward the
end of January.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep giving you guys updates and I'll
keep posting pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of strains that I bred,
I've got an email from a listener that
[SPEAKER_00]: starts off by giving me a compliment and
then they ask me to give advice on growing
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might check my Instagram and then I'm
going to come back and read this email and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about growing strains that I have
bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab of some of the cheap hash I
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of tastes like, I don't know,
maybe cream of broccoli soup or maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: cream corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had sort of a vegetable-y, soft,
smooth flavor that I don't approve of.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to dab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to do something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody need a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take a dab, there's some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get on with the podcast,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I was going to read an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it right here in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the Midwest, also known as
Prohibition Land, so you can call me To
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roach, which is my Dude Grows crew
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, To The Roach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to make friends with anybody from the
Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, I heard of your
show from the guys over at the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been hooked ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've caught up on the majority of your
episodes and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, thanks for listening to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I've got you hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you loved the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I was lucky enough to take
advantage of the Black Friday sale on your
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hella Dank Seed Bank did a really
great Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing another sale right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grab yourself some iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I just popped some prana seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also picked up some morning dew and
storm shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, have you ever done a show
with detailed information or tips on
[SPEAKER_00]: growing said strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time and for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the knowledge and entertainment,
I will give my mom a big hug for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: take it to the next level and smoke a fat
dab with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that sounds good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going above and beyond with that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, To The Roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, To The Roach, thanks for the great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have actually thought about doing
podcasts about strains that I've read,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it felt kind of, I don't know,
self-centered or egotistical or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: spending a whole podcast talking about
something that I created.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you asked for it and you
actually sent a list of strains that you
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased and wanted tips on, I've decided
that I will start doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to get through a few strains
over a few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just do one strain per episode and
I'll probably do, I'll space them out
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did make a few notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain that I chose to start with is
morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would have chosen a rise,
but since you sent the email that inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: this and you said that you had prana
morning dew and storm shadow, I felt that
[SPEAKER_00]: morning dew would be a good place to start
out of those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will work our way through a
lot of the other iry genetics lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I chose morning dew out of
those three is because it's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog, which was kind of my debut
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the first strains that I
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had made plenty before that,
but I never put anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog was the thing that I
passed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a bunch of packs of those away at
the cannabis cups in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that was at the Denver Mart
Outdoors, I just walked around and gave
[SPEAKER_00]: five packs of seeds away to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave away the heart of gold and I gave
away the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grateful dog was a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People seemed to really love the grateful
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics of the grateful dog is of
course the Chem 91, also known as the SVK
[SPEAKER_00]: cut, crossed to San Fernando Valley OG
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also known as the Deadhead OG,
but it's a little bit inbred and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: worked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the grateful dog Femseed,
because I put it out in only a feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was crossed to the Arise,
which is Golden Goat, crossed to
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'm breaking down the family
tree kind of far, but I like to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it explains why plants grow the
way that they do and what traits you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat, of course, is Island
Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian, and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you get that tropical
flavor from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Hawaiian gives it the tropical
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Island Sweet Skunk, of course,
gives it that sweet, tangy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Romulan is what makes it grow
so well, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of those made a really
great combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hawaiian probably gives it the Sativa
punch that it's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Golden Goat is a great
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bred that to the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker, of course, is Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D crossed to the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem D female was pollinated by a male
known as Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph OG is an OG Kush male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Daybreaker cross was made by our
friends Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got seeds from Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a marvelous male and female of the
Daybreaker in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made Daybreaker F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the Black Cherry Chem came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few great crosses came out of that
batch of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I made the Arise there, then I took
the Arise male, which is known as King
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon, and I crossed him to my Grateful
Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the progeny of Arise crossed to
Grateful Dog was known as Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's named after a Grateful
Dead song because it's got the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the morning I kind of thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Grateful Dog, which is the
Grateful Dead offshoot, named after a
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead song about Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fairly proud and was fairly excited
of Morning Dew because, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a strain I created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog was the first strain I
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a timeline put together to
show a little bit of progress in my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are two of my best known
products, other than the Lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grateful Dog and the Arise are
probably, and the Lemon Jeffrey would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the top three most popular strains I've
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun to have them put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've told you a lot about how they
were bred or why they were bred,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the names came about and what they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about growing
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should you expect from Morning Dew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind that Morning Dew is an
F1 hybrid and there will be phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see differences in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is basically what I think will
work for every phenotype, although there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be some outliers and also your
conditions, your environment, your lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrients, all of those things will
play a part in everything that I'm about
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have LEDs or HIDs, it may take you
a little bit longer or shorter flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using hydroponics or soil-less
mixes, it may take you a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little shorter, but here's a basic
guideline and some things that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: found by running a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are things that I found you can
expect from Morning Dew seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are going to take you about
55 to 65 days of flowering to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually nine weeks is just about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew plants are going to get medium
tall and they'll be kind of bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top it, if you let it grow to about
two feet tall and then take out that main
[SPEAKER_00]: node right out of the middle, then it'll
start bushing out real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll bush out and get kind of
semi-medium tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get a lot of heads that way that
will really increase your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that, it's going to need some
supports right before you put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put the supports on too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the tomato cage off, leave the
sticks off, leave the cage off,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the netting off so that you can put
some fans on it and let these plants blow
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also go in there and super crop stuff so
that it gets a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it the pop and twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that on another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pop it or you grab it and then
you give it a little twist right above
[SPEAKER_00]: your finger, pop and it goes pop,
makes a little stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will like that, but do that stuff
before you put supports on and then right
[SPEAKER_00]: before you flower it, go ahead and put
your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's trellising, if it's a tomato cage,
if it sticks, it'll need that in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't do it too early because you
don't want to make it weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew is going to produce buds that
its own branches can't support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll need some sort of supports if you do
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be medium tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need some supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would top it and get it kind of bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, I'm trying to figure out which
order we should go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need some cages or some nets
or sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about, it's going to be
stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this one is going to be stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need some carbon
filtration or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow this in an
apartment or a house next door to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else or in an illegal state, if you're
going to grow Morning Dew, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest plenty of carbon filtration,
maybe something else around the house that
[SPEAKER_00]: smells good also that distracts from the
smell, it's going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to increase that stank
ass aroma in the Morning Dew, feed it some
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp type products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really likes liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really enjoys liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes veg bloom products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes shine very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed it kelp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also seems to like the pH semi-low in
late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that it kind of, it goes a
little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If later in flower, like around when it
starts purple and out, you'll see the
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew will start to purple out and
change colors on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe lower the pH just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going 6.4 or 6.5 already,
maybe try 6.3 or 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go one or two points lower than you
normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that the Morning Dew
tends to like the lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I've learned about the
Morning Dew is that it can use a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more Cal Mag than most of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do, I wouldn't increase the
dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would increase the frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just feed, if you're doing Cal Mag
once a week, I would maybe do Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe add some Epsom salts in there,
but be careful with the nutrients because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to go too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an OG Kush kind of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going too hard with the nutrients could
cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overwater, but make sure you have
plenty of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Jorge, Jorge Cervantes taught us
we want water to be abundant, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got like a three gallon pot,
probably pour about half of a gallon on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of there and let it saturate
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to take,
depending on the size of your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, maybe two or three days for that
water to dry up and need water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get fairly dry before you water it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Morning Dew, the Grateful Dog,
likes a little bit of a dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooler temps will help you bring out the
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that these plants change colors
later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will turn really cool
purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower temps will certainly help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps with most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing I said about the Kalmag,
about it wanting a little extra Kalmag,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of your OG style plants are going to
want a little more Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give your leaves a really
sweet, serrated look.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stand up strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cooler temps, add some Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you guys, the Morning Dew,
there are some freak ass mutant phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran a lot of these seeds and I only
came across a few mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one mutant that was fucking
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like I had topped it and it grew
four equal tops right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't finish it because I didn't have
room for that mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to see what it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't waste space on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got big enough to see that it was a
freak and when it had to get thrown away,
[SPEAKER_00]: it got cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of other odd-leaf
shaped plants in there, but I finished a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of those and I found that the fatter
leaf phenotypes of Morning Dew have the
[SPEAKER_00]: stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one with the broader the
leaf, the more the stank it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the ones that got black when they
started finishing, the ones that turned
[SPEAKER_00]: real dark in the leaves, almost a black
color, those had the stank, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: an OG kush, dirty feet, sort of make your
nose crinkle up, but in a good way,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were also the slower grower
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were lankier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew a little bit slower,
but they had the stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't produce as much herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produced further spaced golf balls
instead of spears, but it was such good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality herb that it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fat-leafed one is going to be a
smaller-producing, slower-growing plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to put out the stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want some weed that you can
smell six blocks away when you light a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint, that's the phenotype you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a skinnier-leafed phenotype
that's got fairly skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if those skinny leaves are
coming from the Golden Goat or the Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: 91, but they're skinny leaves and you'll
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the skinny leaf one,
you'll go, I think that's what he's
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets kind of tall, but it makes just
long, skinny buds and it's just coated in
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the stink to it, but not the
stink like the other phenotypes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more like the chem with some
sweet going on, is what I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like chem, but it had the Golden
Goat background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like if you put a Golden Goat in a
jar that had Chem Dog in it before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it seemed to be more of the
THC-dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a better, just a head-ripping high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fatter-leafed one was kind of,
it got too high, but it was more like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the face, more like in the eyeballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the skinny-leaf one, it just made my
brain spin around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it's got more of a THC
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two different phenotypes you
can look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier to top them, when you top
morning dew or if you trellis morning dew
[SPEAKER_00]: out, give her plenty of time to recover
because she's kind of a slower growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and you don't want to top a plant
and then put her right into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do top her, give her plenty of
time to recover from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let those hormones move back up to the
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the hormones decide where they're
going to be before you flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say a week is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go 10 to 14 days if it were up to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let your topped plant recover before
you put it into flower, and that's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea with any strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the morning dew, sometimes you've got
a slower growing phenotype, so make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you give it plenty of time to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it stretch back out before you flower
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you'll just end up with a bunch of
little tiny buds at the top, and that's no
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a cola up there at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take a good picture and brag
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some cages or some nets or some sticks
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take some bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take some trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew is also very powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's powdery mildew resistant,
we have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some plants outdoors, not myself,
but a friend had some plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them except the morning dew got
powdery mildew on them over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that you can think
about if you're going to grow outdoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the morning dew is one that will do
well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely one of the faster
finishers, and it's one of my most chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, chem-y sort of scented strains that
I've made available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're into something that's got
that chem sort of funk to it, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: got some like dirty feet and sort of
chem-y, and it smells disgustingly
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hints of gas in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes because of the golden
goat, you end up with these like real
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tropical tones that mix in with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great phenotypes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a quick breakdown of morning
dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really good email, a really
good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had the opportunity to talk
about a strain I've bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I'm proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've got passion about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was honestly a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on doing more episodes about more
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably do the three you asked about
first, and then we'll branch off to other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dude, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody else out there has a
question or something they'd like to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will read your email on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy doing the
listener-generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also don't forget that the morning dew
seeds are available at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part where I thank you for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ask you to follow me on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if you follow me on
Facebook and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, I use my other company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I R I E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably at 16,000 followers by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of great cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this podcast,
I bet you will like my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to reach out to me and you're
not into the social media, of course you
[SPEAKER_00]: can email me once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that I've got a YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 140 old episodes up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep telling you guys that they're
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're paying attention, I'm sure you
can see that they're slowly trickling up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ties up my computer and it takes a
long time to make those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of bandwidth to upload
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going up slowly, but they will
all get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I'll get caught up to 276
episodes on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also don't forget about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a way for podcast listeners to
support podcast content providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to learn more on how to
support this podcast, I invite you to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information that you need to sign
up will be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trend seems to be that most people
have been contributing $4 and 20 cents per
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently learned that there was a
cannabis advocate who has a podcast or a
[SPEAKER_00]: news show somewhere and they encouraged
their listeners to go find another
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis advocate or podcast or show that
supported the legalization of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute $4 and 20 cents to that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like a few people listened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned it on the last
episode, but through Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions, I was able to cover the
cost of my website this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website iregeneticscolorado.com is
where I host the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's then uploaded through an RSS feed to
iTunes and Stitcher and all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast services that you hear it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without that website, I would not be
able to host the podcast for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe a huge thank you to everybody who
contributed to Patreon last year and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone who is continuing to contribute
to Patreon this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all the past, present,
and future contributors to my Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure everybody else listening to
the podcast appreciates it also because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making it free for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, if you can't contribute,
don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who can contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this podcast to be free,
but there are people who feel like they
[SPEAKER_00]: can help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say thank you to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you and the listeners that
can't contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They appreciate you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
you can tell that my throat's starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Brett C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning,
[SPEAKER_02]: cry this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby, cry today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never see those people anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning this morning.
I need more today.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the morning.
