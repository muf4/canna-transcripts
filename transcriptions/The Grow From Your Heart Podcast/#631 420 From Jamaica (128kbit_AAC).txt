[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the continued

[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble on too much at the
start of this show because this is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: episode in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say thank you for watching
the 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The previous episode was the 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had about 25, 30 friends pop through
through the Zoom meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were 22 people on screen at
one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people came, a few people went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who came
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who watched that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a beautiful, glorious train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I will invite so many
people on camera ever again, but it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful experience and I did enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I don't know if we'll do
that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have shows with other guests,
but certainly not 25 other guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part is out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thanked you for the 420 show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the 421 show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a special significance for 420
and 421 in the Rastafari culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some good friends to teach us about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends who came from
Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: To teach us about 420 and 421 in Rastafari
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things I should mention before
we roll that clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of sounds of Jamaica in
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not recording in a recording
studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are recording in a banana field in
Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will hear birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hear dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear some Jamaican reggae music in
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the natural sound of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob and I were having some scheduling
conflicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually out of town for the 420
weekend and a couple of days before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob was trying to record with me then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Bob's got that beautiful Jamaican
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his internet wasn't really super strong
at some times and his Zoom meeting kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: goes wonky a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bob was kind enough to set up a camera,
grab a Rastafari elder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big respect to the
Rastafari elder who appeared on camera for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to teach us a lot about Rastafari and
420 and the correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Bob grabbed a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pressed record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they recorded a segment to teach us
about the importance of 420 and 421 to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica and Rastas and Rastafari across
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will raise some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will have a lot of questions if
you're not familiar with Rasta culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things may be brand new
words, brand new terms, brand new phrases
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any questions, I look
forward to your emails, your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot wait to hear the questions that
this show brings up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel like I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I wasn't going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's bring in the
segment with Rasta Bob and his friend from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the importance of 420 to Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to share with the
international community that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just thinking about the visit of his
majesty on the 21st and the year that it
[SPEAKER_01]: happened, I think it was what,
63?
[SPEAKER_01]: 66.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking back in Jamaica's history,
but then Ganja was super.
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal or criminalized, you know,
where Rasta was being beaten and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, eventually it was very
hard time where people would take on to
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that day I know in particular,
it was almost like it was free that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I hear people talking about
thousands of chalice and thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: spliff and whole heap of pounds of herb
and police not knowing what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually gave a free for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even was concerned about Ganja
on that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420 in the preparation, you know,
intensity for his visit of his imperial
[SPEAKER_01]: majesty the following day, the 21st.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of hoping if you could
just, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, give thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that what we now know as 420
didn't exist until perhaps a decade or a
[SPEAKER_02]: little less than a decade after 1966,
which is when his majesty came to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the important visit of his majesty
started from the 18th of April in
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinidad, which was his first stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the 21st of April, he was on his
way to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Jamaica had declared a public holiday
for the 21st of April, 1966 to meet the
[SPEAKER_02]: arrival of his majesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that meant is that Rastafari,
who was still very much the outcast in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica, started to mobilize themselves on
the 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 20th became a major mobilization
day for Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you remember that at those in those
days, Rastafari couldn't take a bus and
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have certain kind of access.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the accounts of various brethren is
that they started to walk from all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the island into the valleys through the
Hope Valley in an effort to get out by the
[SPEAKER_02]: airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in so doing, they were also sure that
a part of the celebration was ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of the account of his majesty is
people actually came out with herb
[SPEAKER_02]: branches, palm leaves, ganja, big star.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As as parts of the celebration of this
ancient king who would now touch down on
[SPEAKER_02]: the Jamaican land.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it meant is that Rastafari,
who hold ganja as a part of the connection
[SPEAKER_02]: to divine wanted to incense, create a herb
atmosphere to receive the Solomonic king.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, as far as we are
concerned, ganja is a part of that
[SPEAKER_02]: Solomonic legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A part of our lore is that it is the herb
that emerges from the tomb of Solomon
[SPEAKER_02]: after he passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in receiving this king and in keeping
with our fire element, because fire is an
[SPEAKER_02]: element that is very much central to
Rastafari experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in lieu of building a fire key and
holding a naya bindi, the ritual of ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes the embodiment of that fire
principle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what he said is that Gredrin stormed
the tarmac, blazing chalice and issuing
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke or incense of her ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the official protocol could do nothing
but just silently observe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't choose to arrest or in any
way abuse Rastafari, which still was very
[SPEAKER_02]: much standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you remember three years before
his majesty arrived in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had a major Rastafari repression in the
Coral Gardens incident in 1963.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a part of our conversation is that his
majesty actually come three years later to
[SPEAKER_02]: check on iron eye, particularly as it
emerged from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't want history from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why 63 was sticking out in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Coral Gardens incident was really,
just in summary for all the viewers and
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners, was just where the state itself
from my understanding, the government
[SPEAKER_01]: issued a decree that, you know,
a terrible atrocity was... Kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill them on sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beat them, kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't even the police and the
soldiers that were given that authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that even the echelons of society
and public, general public, were a part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can beat and kill
Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On their good Friday, bad Friday for
Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get your point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real thing is that her became a major
part of how Rastafari mobilized the day
[SPEAKER_02]: before his majesty arrived.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our mind, the real beginning of 420
is our overnight vigil in receiving his
[SPEAKER_02]: majesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know 420 also has a time issue as a
culture operating around a certain time of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day for this Herb Sacrament.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't necessarily claim that
Rastafari needed that kind of retreat that
[SPEAKER_02]: the 420 space that emerges in the 70s
among mummies and, you know, a range of
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are trying to have this break.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, Herb is not a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a part of our consistent communing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in some instances, people talk
about microdosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is our microdosing throughout the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are allowed to, because it doesn't
impair.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we develop the kind of training
where Herb becomes a necessary sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient to fuel and keep our work moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we come out of that space where Herb
infused work becomes clearly a
[SPEAKER_02]: demonstration of our spirituality and our
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, some people think that they can't
work unless the heavens have been set
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly in this Herb space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our Herb approach is not necessarily
driven by an hour, even though we do have
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of approach where people would
have a morning cup as a way of setting
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they might want one
midday, certainly after work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is usually, I suppose,
more in keeping with that idea of 420,
[SPEAKER_02]: that after work, unwinding, usually in a
congregation, that's when...
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it is more the school as I
think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: After school, you know, 420, that was
really the whole high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when, you know, school is out a
little early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 420, we all, you know, link up
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our night school.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is a person far right embedded,
so it's not, you know, targeted for a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe on a lunar cycle, right around,
it's more interwoven within that
[SPEAKER_01]: tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just the whole 420 and all the
celebrations going out, I just want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: give a little...
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, heights in terms of what that
day 420 represented for Rastafari and the
[SPEAKER_01]: different celebratory preparation kind of
aspect that it would mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 420 begin with us in principle,
just based on the importance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: arrival of His Majesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a major anniversary of our
mobilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within our community, that's when our
nabbing begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually begins on the night of the
20th in honor of receiving His Majesty's
[SPEAKER_02]: arrival on the 21st.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 20th of April, which is how we
would speak it, is an important
[SPEAKER_02]: mobilization day for Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that would mean is ones would be
coming in with their sacrament as a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of this communion that is shared freely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, tons of herbs, barrels and bales
of herbs coming in to the various points
[SPEAKER_02]: that I and I would move to congregate
usually for a nabbing celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, give thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bunga Naya.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in Naya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot left to say after that
beautiful segment from our friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make sure to take a moment
and give thanks to our friends for taking
[SPEAKER_00]: time out of their day to film that video
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see the Jamaican sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see the banana trees in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also thank you for sharing the wisdom and
knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shared a lot of knowledge about the
island of Jamaica, the significance of 420
[SPEAKER_00]: and 421.
[SPEAKER_00]: The significance of those dates for the
island, the significance of those dates
[SPEAKER_00]: for Rasta and the significance of that
date and those dates for Ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the correlation of all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect for teaching us so much about
Ganja and Rasta and 420 in such a short
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
