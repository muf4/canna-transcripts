right We'd like to talk about what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking on at the start of the show Mike
and I were already talking about how
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbed out We are we started off by taking
dabs of some clementine HC FSE Big ol
[SPEAKER_01]: chunky diamonds with a lot of turps on it
just delicious Then we switched to some
[SPEAKER_01]: holy grail kush, which was even more
delicious in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cuz I don't smoke a lot of that I was
kind of spoiled with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really nice flavor Then Mike
threw down some Lucinda Williams HC FSE
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dunked that into some clementine turps
That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really nice Then after the break
we smoked more of the holy grail kush
[SPEAKER_01]: after Mike's little cigarette break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a good choice before we got
got into recording we were I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a Slowdown that needed to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might have been too amped up
after all that clementine sativa type dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, all that clementine had me racing got
me chilled out got me ready for a good
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast Got me ready to go Hey Mike,
you ready to jump right into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go right starting with Oklahoma,
Oklahoma So a couple episodes ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: we talked about Oklahoma Legalizing
medical marijuana Yes, we did shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: all of our friends in Oklahoma We got
quite a few friends out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: listened to the podcast that support us
big shout out You know who you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my friends sent us a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, hey, dude Oklahoma just
legalized and then as soon as they
[SPEAKER_01]: announced the rules we realized that it
totally sucks So we did some investigating
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some investigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one thing I noticed There is no
list of qualifying conditions it's just up
[SPEAKER_01]: to your doc to decide if you Should get
medical marijuana or not as it was
[SPEAKER_00]: originally Yeah, Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have some really interesting
rules the The no list of requirements is
[SPEAKER_00]: just the one what you've got a list of
some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got good notes on this I just
scanned yes article this morning So they
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned the first thing that I noticed
was no list of qualifying conditions So I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess we found a negative and a positive
to that The doc can assign your medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana recommendation if you've got a
hangnail and he thinks that your medical
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana may help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does open it up That's gonna be up to
the doc or the Doc's gonna be liberal with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they gonna be kind of tight with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's that's gonna depend wildly on
implementation and practice if Just basing
[SPEAKER_00]: what other states have gone through like I
want to say it was Michigan that When the
[SPEAKER_00]: news got footage of 500 people In a hotel
lobby waiting in line to see the only two
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors in the state that were signing
cards the story was about how Two doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: signed up 500 people in a weekend not how
only two doctors in the state are willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this and so people have to jump like
The way the story was presented led to a
[SPEAKER_00]: backlash that completely imploded their
system and they've had to restart like
[SPEAKER_00]: three times now and With no patient list
at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be like, California Where
there's people set up everywhere where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can walk in get your card walk across the
street And shop medically and that system
[SPEAKER_00]: has been in place for 20 years now It's
currently being Rebuilt from the ground up
[SPEAKER_00]: under legalization, which apparently they
weren't quite ready for but California
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get there But if the doctors Like
as a group start getting backlash because
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like certain members of their
community are over prescribing for Stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rest of the community doesn't see
is worthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some push and pull on
different systems different
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations for different ailments The
way I was just thinking of it though is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado we've never been able to expand
our list There's a list of conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: several other conditions Have been
presented and pushed through the process
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the last step they get denied And
they all get denied for the same reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's not a big FDA-backed
double-blind study showing that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is an effective treatment option for blank
There's a lot of anecdotal evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but until that last big study happens fuck
off and now Oklahoma won't have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with that if Evidence starts to point to
some some treatment option that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: currently utilizing cannabis For They can
just start recommending right off the bat
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to tell that whole
population Pretend you've got cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretend you've got the rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we can get you in there It'll
take three years to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it simplifies that process All
right, so that that's gonna work to some
[SPEAKER_01]: folks advantage and it's up to the doc
Hopefully your doc is liberal and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna find good doctors there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me that stuff happens Another thing
that popped out was they banned all smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana so you can't smoke
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I don't like that because It's
gonna be a very odd rule yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and they're not the only place to do
that Florida's currently being sued and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're If I Sorry guys, it's been a crazy
chunk of my life listeners of the show for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while know that my life's nuts right
now, but I'm like 95% sure Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: patients just won the right to smoke their
meds in court that that that provision of
[SPEAKER_00]: their law was struck down finally in
court, but Oklahoma won't be the first to
[SPEAKER_00]: have that rule and I think a lot of the
rules were about to cover from this point
[SPEAKER_00]: forward If I remember right the governor
of Oklahoma was against the legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative originally Which likely means
they've been listening to a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: national anti pot people It's one of the
things governors do if if they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: position on something from the onset they
look for other people arguing for their
[SPEAKER_00]: position and get the arguments from those
people and I think that's why we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: the list of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saying or that we're about to go
over is because National anti pot groups
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying a couple of different things to
fuck over the industry They've tried in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of states where legalizations
already happen or matter Medicals already
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and they haven't been successful
But with Oklahoma, they're gonna get some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them implemented from the get-go and
we're gonna see how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right They're supposed to have another
meeting soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a deadline set for this meeting I
know a lot of people in Oklahoma are
[SPEAKER_00]: really pissed over this is what I was
reading Yes, we've got friends that
[SPEAKER_01]: brought this to my attention, which is why
we're talking about it So shout out to our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no smokable flowers, which I I think
that's weird because in my opinion I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: a doctor in my opinion smoking is the most
immediate and effective relief you can
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke and you feel it by the time you're
exhaling you feel it if there's a flower
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker by the time you blow out that
flower you you feel it if you're a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker by the time you blow out that dab
you feel it if you can't consume flower
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking medicine away from people
like the most effective obvious old-school
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional way of consuming it is now
removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's ridiculous and They do
allow edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have edibles Which isn't that
where we find all of our problems like 90%
[SPEAKER_01]: of our problems are with people fucking up
with edibles the Yeah, the the path to
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles in 1998 Was a lot safer than it is
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just being able to walk in and buy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like teenagers with booze like It's
it's just not something you should do
[SPEAKER_00]: without a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Or at least like a pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And a friend to sit there and be like
dude, you're you're just really baked calm
[SPEAKER_00]: down Don't call 9-1-1 Edibles have been
where a lot of the the stupid problems
[SPEAKER_00]: happen Every place that legalizes they get
a big wave of poison center calls the next
[SPEAKER_00]: few years Yeah, and some of that's because
people are stupid and irresponsible with
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles but a lot of that's because these
are exposures that were Happening before
[SPEAKER_00]: and are now just being reported because of
legalization like it's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing health-wise But it's a
bad thing pro legalization data wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think I just found it weird that they
allow edibles They're easier to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're easier to have too much of I just
but you can't smoke a little bit of flour
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't like that people seem to
think of them is safer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smoking like that's a main reason why
that market So popular I Get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not smoking not ruining your lungs,
which brings me to another part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They limited potency on flowers to 20% and
concentrates at 12% THC potency 12% on a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate that's The way I read it in
the press article didn't make a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sense How do you have a concentrate with
12% and this was when I mentioned Just a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute ago that I think the governor of
Oklahoma may have been listening to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the national anti pot folks Limiting
THC potency is a big thing project Sam's
[SPEAKER_00]: been pushing They tried it in Colorado and
failed they tried it in Canada and failed
[SPEAKER_00]: They've tried it in a couple of other
states and failed And it looks like they
[SPEAKER_00]: might have succeeded somewhat in Oklahoma
and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going for 12 or 16 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no cap for flower Yeah, it would have
reset the whole industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna The way I read it had the
plant potency and It specified it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant potency can be 20 It didn't
specify flower, but it made it seem like
[SPEAKER_01]: flower was included in the 12% limit Okay,
so when I've got a plant at the end it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be or that plant contested 20% But my
final product Since they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: release flower because flowers are
illegal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can you I honestly don't know the rules
in Oklahoma or the proposed rules in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma well enough to know if they allow
flowers to be sold for Like with a stick
[SPEAKER_00]: around it says to be vaped only okay
Because like tabletop vapes and flower
[SPEAKER_00]: fapes have been a thing for a decade or
more like well It sounds like your flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: can only test at 20% and then you've got
to turn them into a concentrate that only
[SPEAKER_00]: tests at 12% THC Well, they kind of sounds
like they allow home grows and so like
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be plenty of flower out and
it's not like there's gonna be a possible
[SPEAKER_00]: system for testing flower from home grows
That's gonna take a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a 20 year project folks So
why do you want to limit the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know because they don't want people
getting Getting too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the drumbeat that the anti pot one of
the the notes that they found that
[SPEAKER_00]: resonate with People is the weed of the
60s was 1% THC The weed of today is 30 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the concentrates go to 90 plus.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean It's a bullshit argument because
the weed of the fucking 60s was not 1% If
[SPEAKER_00]: you're curious that number is comes from
including all DEA seizures which include
[SPEAKER_00]: feral hemp And so like in 1964 they
rounded up a lot more Feral hemp and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were rounded up pounds of Colombian herb
being shipped in and sold freely across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country And That number got reported
down the chain to us today and so now anti
[SPEAKER_00]: pop people like it was 1% in 69 right here
It says so in the book And I bet their
[SPEAKER_01]: testing labs back then were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah in what gets tested The stick
the stem they just put the whole thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they test?
[SPEAKER_00]: It like they weigh it and they're like we
found this pound of weed before F-150 this
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking 3500 pounds marijuana They tested
it with the F-150 attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ground up the F-150 and it came out to
point zero one percent THC, but it's THC
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how they do it But the fuck was I
even talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking cops stupid way in the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Concentrates so much percentages THC
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting way higher now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Our mom's weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the it's just a bullshit argument
that they've made that resonates with
[SPEAKER_01]: people and My argument against that is if
I'm trying to medicate And then I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna make up numbers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't know the numbers to my
medication You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is just hypothetically if I'm
gonna medicate and I need to get to Let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say a thousand, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you rather me take ten inhalations
of something that's at a hundred or would
[SPEAKER_01]: you rather me take two inhalations of
five?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundred as a medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to inhale and exhale smoke
or vapor ten times or two times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is healthier for my lungs and body
That's literally Like 50% of the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates exist is the community wanted
a way To get rid of the actual combustion
[SPEAKER_00]: the unhealthy part of the smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and we found a way to do that and
keep the immediate kick of inhalation We
[SPEAKER_00]: get that that immediate immediate and you
can titrate it perfectly you take a puff
[SPEAKER_00]: you give it 30 seconds at most and Nope,
I would like another hit when the joint
[SPEAKER_00]: comes around I'm gonna hit it again by the
time the joint comes around again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, nope I'm where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little too much.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's It's a beautiful system and we kept
it with vaping And we've it's just gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner and cleaner and cleaner and
cleaner And healthier and healthier and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier and it's also gotten a lot
scarier and so the anti-pop people are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get footage of somebody doing a
dab and they go on the news and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're smoking 99% pure THC crystals
that they have to smoke with a blowtorch
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they show that b-roll and it
scares the fuck out of church folk and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get 12% THC limits because I'm
wondering how the fuck they even do that
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if the flowers allowed at 20 like the
plants allowed at 20 What do they do with
[SPEAKER_00]: that 20%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Product they've got to cut it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just like keep pouring propylene
glycol on it until it's at 12 something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that Yeah, I don't I really don't
know how you reduce your THC I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know Time for like if this is gonna be
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is all Still in the process
But if they're trying to to to really go
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of these rules You all might
want to just pick a day that's not 420 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 and get together at the Capitol and
just don't smoke don't fucking wave pot
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf flags just Show up let them know why
you're there and just fucking sit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking way for like three days They need
somebody it takes a lot to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: people to notice and if they some of these
rules are as far along as I think they Are
[SPEAKER_00]: like the day for writing op-eds isn't
passed But like they have another meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: planned but not scheduled at the time that
I wrote this they had the meeting planned
[SPEAKER_01]: But not scheduled to talk with the
committee that's working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article I read Said I want to say it
was like the Oklahoma Department of Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Human Services or some such department
Oklahoma State Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes that one When they release these rules
they kind of admitted that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that they have the authority to make
a couple of these rules like they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: totally out of the scope of their purview,
but So if you guys this applies for
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere that is working on legalization
and we're running out of states that are
[SPEAKER_01]: working on it We're getting it's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting to more states that are have
got some sort of legalization But if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working on getting cannabis
legalized wherever you are get somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: like Mike or myself involved like Convince
one of us and Mike's easy to get to a city
[SPEAKER_01]: council meeting to help you write rules
you need somebody That is actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer that's actually doing this you
wouldn't you wouldn't call I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: think a weird weird fucking analogies You
wouldn't call your math teacher to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: you how to work the buzzsaw and you
wouldn't call your shop teacher to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: you how To do math get them get some
people that are in the industry up here
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about cannabis with these people
that are making the rules So when they say
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're gonna do plants at 20% and
concentrates at 12 I can laugh and shake
[SPEAKER_01]: my head and go wait You guys have no idea
what the fuck you're talking about we can
[SPEAKER_01]: straighten them out before it gets this
far So we got to get we got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody On our team in these meetings
everywhere when we did the the Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada episode I stress like the time
to get involved is is now in In Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to get involved Like now is now
past tense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that was like a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to deal with it right now
You're late, but Continuing to not act is
[SPEAKER_00]: still a bad choice Start writing op-eds to
any local paper any state paper You can
[SPEAKER_00]: contact the governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact the state to port of
health the Board of Health or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: that committee is You can email all these
people directly and let them know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I voted for this These are the
reasons why these are why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Explicitly these specific rules are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I would like to see instead
You can do it like three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: paragraphs You don't have to do the hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is here's why I give a fuck You
can just get right to the meat of your
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Governor so-and-so I'm writing to you
about blank law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like blank rule I think it should
be this instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like the THC caps I think there
should be no limit like it is in most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other functioning medical marijuana
states If you want help wording that feel
[SPEAKER_00]: free to contact me on trouble for sensible
cannabis laws On Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow them on Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws on Facebook support that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get updates from Mike speaking of
updates I've got another message from our
[SPEAKER_01]: friend in Oklahoma that's telling me
what's going on He says there is another
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting in August the health department
will meeting get meet again And then they
[SPEAKER_00]: will have elections coming up in November
so I'm betting before that meeting there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a Period for open comment and then
at that meeting there'll be a portion for
[SPEAKER_00]: public comment and it will be one of those
Fun public meetings that goes for like 12
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half hours But during the portion
for open public comment you just email
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then your email gets distributed
to the whole committee and everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to read them and getting messages
across that way if you get a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people to do it and most of them are
Functional communicators you can get a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of good change made that way Folks in
Oklahoma Now's the time to start emailing
[SPEAKER_01]: those folks find who you need to email in
your locality in your state Find who you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to email in the state your state rep
and let them know that how you want these
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana laws adjusted Now's the
time to start doing that so start sending
[SPEAKER_01]: out the email start going to the meetings
if you hear anything about a meeting about
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana go attend it be a part
of it rally the troops just go and listen
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's all you have to do to start is
just go and listen and Start writing
[SPEAKER_00]: emails, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also says no grows or dispensaries
until August Which means most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning rules and all of that haven't been
finalized yet either which means people
[SPEAKER_00]: need to start Watching for those briefs in
the local paper If you're in Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: right now you should be able to like look
up your city your town Or county or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they call it there and find your
government's webpage and Say you live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Tulsa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to look up the Tulsa
City government's webpage and on there
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll have their agenda listed for every
week and Scanning through those agendas is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I found the meat of all of the
Zoning rule making hearings here in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff didn't Make the paper until the
day of usually or if it made the paper at
[SPEAKER_00]: all It would be in a past tense like by
the way on Monday you missed right this
[SPEAKER_00]: happened at this meeting you didn't get to
but After two or three weeks to just check
[SPEAKER_00]: in back with the Pueblo City the city of
Pueblo webpage I figured out that when
[SPEAKER_00]: they uploaded their new thing every week
and then I just checked back I can't I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was Mondays check back Monday at
like noon and scan through it real quick
[SPEAKER_00]: to see If they had anything that pertained
to us and when they did I'd made sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: was there To the point where I haven't
been in a while in city council members
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been there for a while I've been
asking about like where's Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, is he okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: He just disappeared Mike's got a kid and a
brand new kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike's a little bit distracted folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where he is Yeah, two kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to keep you moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, dude Thanks for coming and doing a
podcast with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to have you here every so often
the folks do like your presence on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show they like it when we ramble So
potency what what the hell with the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fucked up rule y'all Yeah,
and that's it just isn't it doesn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: suck for customers The reason the anti-pop
people are pushing that is because it
[SPEAKER_00]: cripples businesses When you grow of a
strand of cannabis the potency can vary
[SPEAKER_00]: wildly based on a dozen different factors
Your 30% killer arise like if I grow it It
[SPEAKER_00]: just there's so many things that go into
it when when a crop harvests you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea if you've got a 16 or if you've got a
30 and If you send half of your crop off
[SPEAKER_00]: to or send off all your testing samples
and half of them come back over 20 If
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to destroy all that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like business can't operate like
that Especially not with the federal tax
[SPEAKER_01]: laws on top of our throats and that's part
of what sets business apart here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado It's I'm not like this because
it's not how I shop but when you walk into
[SPEAKER_01]: a dispensary you hear half the people say
What's your highest testing product?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's got the most THC a that's what I
want to buy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me that I don't care what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what it smells like I want
the most THC a then I'm leaving so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a selling point you want those 30s
those 32s is 33s and 34s it's just hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: find but when you find them that That's
what the people want to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like kind of a you're taking a
strategy away from the market right there
[SPEAKER_00]: It uh, it's not just a strategy away from
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Because then the sales pitches
we've got 1999 like come get your 1999
[SPEAKER_01]: with us come control 1199 with us I would
have to make mistakes to grow 20% THC a
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just not feed it any nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have to cut it down weeks early Yeah
early cut it down a week seven but So none
[SPEAKER_01]: of the genetics I grow would be able To
work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pimping by design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's this is a thought-out strategy
It's not something they've stumbled upon
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're scared They're able to
sell it because it scares people that
[SPEAKER_00]: won't look into it very deeply but that's
I Mean, it's just one of the the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're pushing right now They they
they also want it like the skull and the
[SPEAKER_00]: crossbones and the three pages of warnings
to come right product Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, I hope they get it figured out
down there Let's move on to the so shout
[SPEAKER_01]: outs you guys are getting it figured out I
hope you guys keep going to meetings and
[SPEAKER_01]: get it dialed in because what you got
right now is gonna be a challenge Yep,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another subject here a while back
There was whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just let's make sure we didn't just kill
that recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're still going tight a while
back there was a chain of dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: that got in trouble for doing a thing that
was called looping what looping is is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically in the state of Colorado a
recreational cannabis purchaser is allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to Buy one ounce of recreational cannabis
per day per person one uno ain'ts one
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce to get one And if so what was
happening these guys were buying their one
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce they were going out to the car I
don't know what was really happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they were coming back within the
same business day and they were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: more ounces well and for a long time in
Colorado the law specifically says I Can
[SPEAKER_00]: sell you one ounce of marijuana per
transaction?
[SPEAKER_00]: the law says Transaction that's the word
in the law and so for years in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Transaction was the practice to Most
stores didn't care if you came in bought
[SPEAKER_00]: your limit came back in five or ten or
thirty minutes bought your limit again and
[SPEAKER_01]: left They just enjoyed the extra sale
That's that's what looping is that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: this stemmed from eventually the marijuana
enforcement division and the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Revenue Realized that this
was kind of a loophole, so they sent out a
[SPEAKER_01]: memo saying you cannot do this anymore at
that point most dispensaries stopped they
[SPEAKER_00]: formed a They formed a group to change the
law And make the one ounce per day
[SPEAKER_00]: official law And then they sent out a memo
saying the law that we're gonna pass in
[SPEAKER_00]: January goes into effect in August And the
marijuana industry operating under the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules that they do most of the industry
complied because when we get a memo from
[SPEAKER_00]: the MED We just say sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many would you like sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, like we don't ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't ask for clarification We just try
really hard to do whatever they say That's
[SPEAKER_01]: a great segue into the article that I'm
about to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why This is why the industry
kisses the MED's ass a little bit This
[SPEAKER_01]: article comes from a website called
maryjane.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's m-e-r-r-y-jane.com maryjane Excuse me
for the throat clearing in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about all the dabs earlier This
article is written by a person who is
[SPEAKER_01]: named Chris Moore And it goes like this
sweet leaf lost all of its Denver based
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis licenses for looping or selling
more than One ounce of weed per customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 26 licenses I'll read the article
one of Colorado's largest cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprises just lost their right to do
business in Denver after getting busted
[SPEAKER_01]: for selling Unlawful amounts of weed to
their customers sweet leaf a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis company operating a number of
legally licensed Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: processing facilities as well as
dispensaries all across the state was the
[SPEAKER_01]: subject of a year-long investigation by
local authorities Working to track down on
[SPEAKER_01]: loop to crack down on looping the practice
of selling customers more Marijuana than
[SPEAKER_01]: state law allows I'm gonna kind of skim
over this because it's longer than I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to go but I've got to get you all
the main points We talked about Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: customers can only buy one ounce per day
sweet leaf argued They reportedly use
[SPEAKER_01]: justification to let customers purchase
more than legally allowed police raided
[SPEAKER_01]: eight stores in Denver in March and in
April Denver officials held hearings on
[SPEAKER_01]: disciplinary actions Against stores
accused of looping city city attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up with reams of evidence against
sweet leaf Including video of undercover
[SPEAKER_01]: cops purchasing prohibited amounts of weed
from their stores as well as interviews
[SPEAKER_01]: with the company's employees he estimated
the Attorneys estimated that one single
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet leaf dispensary made over 1,000
looping transactions netting the company
[SPEAKER_01]: an additional four million dollars There's
a reason companies were willing to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah four million dollars sounds like a
decent reason but look at bit them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ass Then it says this week the Denver
Department of Excise and licenses revoked
[SPEAKER_01]: all 26 of sweet leaves medical marijuana
and recreational marijuana licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively preventing the company from
continuing To do business in the city of
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver, so that's what happens you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not fucking around Everyone thinks
we're just hanging out getting high That
[SPEAKER_01]: you can come in and buy a bunch of weed
and then just hang out and take a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs in the back with the people that work
there No, bro, if you fuck up,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll come in and take all of your
licensing is in Denver is 5,000 a license
[SPEAKER_00]: so they were paying 130,000 a year to the
city and 130,000 a year to the state for
[SPEAKER_00]: those licenses they lost just to have the
licenses just to have Yeah, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: making an additional four million through
looping.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were they making through those 26
facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without looping they were one of the
largest outfits in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knew who sweet leaf was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Several grows several stores the
company does have the right to appeal the
[SPEAKER_00]: decision But they also still have licenses
not in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a location in Oregon somewhere
They've got one in Aurora.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've got one in Thornton There
might be one in Colorado Springs Anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna keep reading the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like two short paragraphs left It
says enforcing rules when violations occur
[SPEAKER_01]: occur is an essential part of Denver
successful regulation of one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest legalized marijuana markets in the
world Kilroy said in a statement reported
[SPEAKER_01]: by the Westward sweet leafs illegal
actions undermine the entire regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: framework created by amendment 64 the
Journal Assembly and the Denver City
[SPEAKER_01]: Council the decision supports The will of
the voters for a regulated legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: market Safeguards the legal marijuana
industry and protects the safety and
[SPEAKER_01]: welfare of the public Like Mike said sweet
leaf still runs three other dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: in the state which are not affected by
this ruling and will remain open many of
[SPEAKER_01]: the company's Bud tenders have been
arrested in connection with the
[SPEAKER_01]: investigation But the majority of them
have now been released without criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: charges So you guys if you mess around
with the MED they will come raid your
[SPEAKER_01]: stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will take the bugs Bud tenders to
jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were taken straight to
jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them were released Some of them
did face charges, then they will shut down
[SPEAKER_01]: your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of talk that this story
isn't over yet This was sort of the death
[SPEAKER_00]: blow to the company, but they still have
Several locations they I'm guessing
[SPEAKER_00]: they've still got at least one or two
grows going They're certainly not
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dead right and with that many
Bud tenders arrested that many Bud tenders
[SPEAKER_00]: set free with no charges and Currently no
management or ownership has been charged
[SPEAKER_00]: with a single thing like This story
definitely has the potential to go on for
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they're just compiling and
thinking still giving in a minute and
[SPEAKER_00]: Letting the rope sit there and waiting to
see what kind of knot you tie at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of it All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well if anybody sticks their head through
the end of that Knot, we will definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: let you guys know Sweet leaf no more in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope Did you see the story this week you
saw that the Public consumption buses got
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked with in Denver, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one day where Denver Somebody I
think it was a multi-agency so DPD and the
[SPEAKER_00]: MED and a couple of other groups got
together and they raided two of the buses
[SPEAKER_00]: and They gave everybody public consumption
tickets and fucking cited the driver and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cited the company for basically hosting an
unlicensed consumption event and then left
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there weren't like mass arrests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like the company didn't have to
bail 40 tourists out of Denver County or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything but It was announced this week
that that was because of the CNN footage
[SPEAKER_00]: from New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that makes sense where a CNN reporter
was Flashing the fucking gas mask bong and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit on New Year's Eve coverage Mike said
consumption bus some folks may not know
[SPEAKER_01]: what those words mean in a row together
like that consumption bus what So a while
[SPEAKER_01]: back Colorado decided that it was illegal
to consume Yeah, but the drivers blocked
[SPEAKER_00]: off like they're in their own airtight
chamber away from the rest of the fun bus
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colorado outlawed smoking in a public
place you can't we can't smoke At
[SPEAKER_01]: gatherings anymore that are indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not allowed but you can rent a
private bus and pull it up right outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the club and Let people that are 21 and
over onto that bus and then they can bring
[SPEAKER_01]: in their own Concentrates and they can
smoke out in the bus or at least that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been happening on the regular for five
years now Yeah, we thought that that was
[SPEAKER_01]: cool But on New Year's a reporter came and
did a little article and featured one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the buses and was like hey Look,
we're doing this and so that triggered the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana enforcement division The Denver
Department of the Denver Police Department
[SPEAKER_01]: and whoever else decided to jump in that
day They decided one night to go and take
[SPEAKER_01]: down a couple of the private party
consumption buses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Well, they were they were working on
this Big case for like six fucking months
[SPEAKER_01]: to took them six months to go hit the
consumption bus Yeah, they they take their
[SPEAKER_00]: time when they're busting stoners They
knew they weren't going anywhere they were
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bus they knew where to find them
And it's it's one of those things where It
[SPEAKER_00]: was so poorly done on law enforcement part
like the companies are fucking through
[SPEAKER_00]: suing the city and Out early is
threatening to They're not at all amused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their lawyers are pissed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been going on for years Now if
somebody had a problem with it a letter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first six months of operation would
have taken care of it it has lessened the
[SPEAKER_01]: need or desire for me to illegally consume
cannabis inside of a venue if I'm seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: reggae band and I know that the Dab bus is
right outside and I'll just go out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and take a dab, you know There's no need
to smoke a joint illegally in the reggae
[SPEAKER_01]: show I just go out there and take a quick
dab between bands and come right back in
[SPEAKER_00]: and see the concert I'm part of me still
just kind of pissed that we have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this Fight still yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've we legalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been common practice to consume
marijuana in big public gatherings for I
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't even tell you how long literally
every fucking concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever been to since the time I was
five There ought to be a place at every
[SPEAKER_00]: concert venue where it's like,
oh you want to smoke a joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you please just go over to section K,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yeah, it's it shouldn't be that hard
like oh Reggae band playing at the bar
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight fucking if you want to smoke just
run up to the roof Yeah, like it's we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need fucking special buses But
apparently we needed special buses and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not even sure if we could Have the
buses Like it's just such a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again guys, I know I always talk about
writing rules and being involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation sure There's consumption make
sure there's somewhere that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: consume when you write your new rules
bring that up Get that on the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a couple shout outs big
shout out to my friend Maddie E a special
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to Sam and a big fat shout out
to Justin Aldridge Thanks for all the love
[SPEAKER_01]: and support you guys.

love and tell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know why y'all are awesome You'd
probably earned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so Maybe you guys get out get
some what the fuck kind of mosquito is
[SPEAKER_01]: that get some consumption laws on the
books when you guys go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Write the rules for your locality Hey
Mike, do you got anything else to say
[SPEAKER_01]: while you've got a whole bunch of people
listening to you?

once again the takeaway from the white mic
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is get involved Yes, always get
involved get involved Get yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: involved because when you're not involved
people write dipshit rules like 20% So
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to do with the technology you have in
your pocket When you get home from work
[SPEAKER_00]: after listening to the show and you've got
two seconds you can just fire off a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: email to All of your elected

minutes and like a minute and a half of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is trying to pick which two words To
Google to get you the right governor It's
[SPEAKER_00]: not hard folks just we need more of the
community to get involved like We're too
