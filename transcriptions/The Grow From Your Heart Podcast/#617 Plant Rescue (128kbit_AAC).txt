[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of great emails
highlighted for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That music ended just right on time for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question for today's message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got this question from several
people, so I kind of paraphrased the
[SPEAKER_00]: emails here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first question goes a little bit
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically said, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past couple of episodes,
you've talked about being a seed breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed vendor, a seed seller, a seed
maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have talked about your
seeds a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see you on social media, but what you
don't say other than that one quick
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial at the start of the show is
where can we get your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that briefly here on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in case you're not aware,
I am I read genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the sole proprietor, sole breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do 99.9% of the work for I read
genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lovely friend who a partner in
crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to call her that, who helps me
package up a lot of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the seed selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a little bit of the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does the heat sealing is done by her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have another lovely person who does
a lot of the shipping for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to both of them for keeping
me moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 99 point something percent of I read
genetics, premium seeds is all done by me
[SPEAKER_00]: by Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys see a lot of that stuff on the
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can we get the seeds is the main
point of this rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have, of course, at the start of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to the podcast on the
audio form, you hear that seeds here now
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial, the number one place I would
recommend to get seeds of any brand from
[SPEAKER_00]: any breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, use coupon code G F Y H 10 at
seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save you 10% off of your entire
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds here now.com has a great selection,
not only of my seeds, but a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also seeds here now.com quite often gets
my first releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make my first drop debut drops,
go to seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next place I would recommend to get
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are a kind of in no particular
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next place I would say is the hella
dank seed company and you can find them at
[SPEAKER_00]: dank seed dot store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank seed dot store is a great place to
find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heritage seed bank is a great place to
find I read genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good spot to find my seeds is the
golden ticket seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, golden ticket
and heritage both do auctions on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got an Instagram,
find them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can catch some auctions from
golden ticket or heritage seeds on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with the words you use and the
things you say on Instagram because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to get their account taken
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you do make a PayPal payment to
somebody for seeds, or a Venbo payment or
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of payment where you're sending
digital money for seeds, don't put the
[SPEAKER_00]: words for seeds in the PayPal or in the
notes or whatever because a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: companies don't like seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be a little more careful with that be
a little bit more discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're not on the hustler side of
life, but let's keep the hustlers safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put seeds or certain strain names,
if you put the word Kush or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a PayPal payment, PayPal will flag
that payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take 30 to 90 days for that person
to receive that payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they receive that payment, if PayPal
deems that that account has been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: suspicious or fraudulent activity,
they will freeze the account.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will seize the assets which are in
the account and they will use those
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts to investigate your fraudulent
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they have depleted your funds and
investigations, they forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cancel the claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They delete your account and it's game
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please you guys, if you're buying seeds
from anybody or if you're buying anything
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet, be careful what you're
putting in the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put the words Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be buying a shirt with mushrooms
on the shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's still not type the word mushrooms in
there just because that is going to flag
[SPEAKER_00]: the algorithm on your pay application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be a little bit more careful when
we're doing stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a side rant, but I feel like that
was very important for a lot of people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's protect each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when the seed sellers and
vendors send you seeds, we slash they do
[SPEAKER_00]: our best to make sure everything is
discreetly and securely packaged so that
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever those seeds are going,
they are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility once they arrive
to understand the laws and legalities in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area on how you handle those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as far as I'm concerned, don't get
them wet and dirty unless that is legal in
[SPEAKER_00]: your, uh, jurisdiction where those seeds
are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can we get seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, seeds here now.com use coupon
code G F Y H 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommended, uh, vendor of
choice, the hella dank seed company at
[SPEAKER_00]: dank seed.store heritage seed bank at
heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say heritage seed bank.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be heritage seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put an accurate list in the show
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also golden ticket seed bank is a
wonderful place for my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another place I recommend getting my seeds
and new vendor that I just added to my
[SPEAKER_00]: list is El Fuego seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Fuego seeds does officially carry iry
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see them out there offering my
seeds, and you're questioning that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another official vendor is hype seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hype seeds is a new, uh, vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of more people coming
online within the next few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of emails to catch up
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will add some more vendors to that
list, but I wanted to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have a solid list of where to get
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can recommend is that you go
to my website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a vendor list on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click right on those vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take you to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take you to my page on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what of my strains are
available on each website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what coupon codes are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them in the shopping cart and
see who has better shipping, less taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build and customize your order
there by shopping on the different vendors
[SPEAKER_00]: at the different websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to mention is if you
sign up for my MailChimp mailing list,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a thing that says stay in touch or
keep in touch or, uh, join the mailing
[SPEAKER_00]: list, something like that on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put in your mailing information
about once a month, maybe every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to spam you too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also try not to forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send an email via my MailChimp web
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will remind you of all of the coupon
codes, new vendor drops, maybe new vendors
[SPEAKER_00]: that haven't added to the website yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe new exclusive deals,
maybe merchandise exclusives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm going to do a live show that not
everybody will know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will include that sort of stuff on the
MailChimp news letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heritage Seeds, Golden Ticket Seed Bank,
uh, Hela Dank Seed Company, El Fuego
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, and Hype Seeds are my recommended
vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find most of them on my website at
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize to El Fuego and Hype Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't added you guys to the website
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm giving you a couple of time
to make sure that you guys keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, uh, it cost me a little bit to
do adjustments to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure you're going to keep
going before I add you on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have to remove you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure it's real before I
make it internet official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe if I add you on there,
you'll sell some more seeds and we'll keep
[SPEAKER_00]: you going, but this should give you a
little bit of a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Fuego Seeds and Hype Seeds are official
new vendors for iregenetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, my favorite is SeedsHereNow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget SeedsHereNow.com and use
coupon code GFYH10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more great places to acquire
iregenetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite places, I mentioned it
a moment ago, is Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of people who do
auctions for iregenetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow me on Cannabuzz,
follow the official iregenetics page,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see auctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've got time, when I know that I'll
be available that evening, I post up an
[SPEAKER_00]: auction on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do it for rare, unreleased,
exclusive, limited edition seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put up some packs that have never
been seen or that will never go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors I listed above.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you guys can get some stuff
that's been in my vault that I decided I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: never going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can get a crack at some gems,
get some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally I'll put up bulk packs that
I've listed above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those auctions do get a little
bit spendy, but sometimes there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: hot steals on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put up a pack that everybody's
already got, you may be able to get it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a really good price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to bid, see if you get
outbid, see if you win it, you might get a
[SPEAKER_00]: steal on one or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple packs on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great place to get iregenetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is starting to sound like a fucking
infomercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap this part up really
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another place to get good iregenetic seeds
is on the iregenetics discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, we've got an iregenetics
discord channel, a discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave's not here, does host auctions on the
discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time that is going to be for
rare gems from the ire vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I selected, things that I
packed up and Dave is taking the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: the work to auction them for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, I should be here
writing, recording, doing podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: editing shows, working in the garden,
packing up seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is more of the thing I should be
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got Dave doing some auctions for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So discord and Cannabuzz are social media
platforms where iregenetic seeds may be
[SPEAKER_00]: available on rare, if not often occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to recap the list for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get into a couple of
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds here now.com dank seed dot store,
heritage seed bank, golden ticket seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank, El Fuego seeds, hype seeds,
and then follow that up with discord and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, check out my website,
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sign up for the MailChimp updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never miss an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a couple of cool coupon codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I think I've got for that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of great grow questions
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how far we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want their name said, yes,
they want me to use the name Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from the grow help tab on
the iregenetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see how much of this I need to
read to get us up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what strains are you
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing Bruce Banner, Gorilla Glue
number four, Girl Scout cookies and white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow to big bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an old school lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing indoors under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in week five growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last feed was a plain water flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll read more about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH was six, five daytime, nighttime
temps are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a description of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what's going on in my buddy,
Carl's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one weird thing you're going to have
to bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My printer didn't print this in a long
column.
[SPEAKER_00]: It printed it two pages side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to hold the two pages side by
side, like a book to make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I look like a complete weirdo on the
camera, if I stutter a lot extra,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because the way the printer printed
this, but I promise you we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the least of our problems today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the biggest problem we face,
things will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my medium is 50, 50 cocoa Fox farm
soil with some perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say 40, 40, 20,
maybe something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 45, 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have 50, 50 and some perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: A percentage of that is perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digress a few weeks ago, my cheap pH pin
gave me incorrect readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I unknowingly fed my plants at a much
lower pH than intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what it exactly was because
my pH pins were off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started showing slight, the plants
started showing slight deficiencies or
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly lockout with the top leaves of
the plants beginning to yellow and get
[SPEAKER_00]: brown spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I realized this, I flushed with water
pH around 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the runoff came out at 4.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said you flushed with water pH
about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: My pH meter doesn't show me any ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pH meter shows me a definite number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either six, two, six, three,
six, four, six, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: My re my meter doesn't ever show me
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, details, details, details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I gave what I thought was an
adequate amount of water to flush,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I did not check the runoff again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you flushed out what you thought was
enough to flush again, two to three days
[SPEAKER_00]: later, I gave a light feeding of general
hydroponics, three part flora series plus
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag giving about 50% of the
recommended chart for that time of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problems persisted and got slightly
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at this point, I think you flushed out
all the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing for the plant to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's just hungry and you only gave
it half of a meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it only got half of a meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I gave it half of a meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're just making it more hungry,
starting at six, five, and eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: going up to seven point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, why are you moving up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a pH around between six, three and
six, four, maybe six, five at the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say six, four and stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is going to help you out a lot
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now your plants were kind of angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had one problem and now you're giving
them a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quit fucking with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give them some consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's show them the way let's get them
out of the struggle with some consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said the word consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I say consistency now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you fed them six, five,
eventually going up to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why you're changing the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because the runoff was barely
climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant, the white widow got a runoff of
4.8 and the Bruce banner got up to 5.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weirdest thing is the girl scout
cookies is the only one that is
[SPEAKER_00]: unaffected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause usually that girl scout cookies is a
real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And healthy while it's gotten the same
treatment as every other plant other than
[SPEAKER_00]: most of this most recent day flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not flush her as it looks healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just gave her a regular feeding
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right, there is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do believe I still need to
flush again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told to get the runoff at least
within 1.0 of my feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm feeding 6.5, the runoff is 5.5
or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to that is why are you growing
runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing trays and meters or are
you growing healthy cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know why you need to run off
within a certain spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make sense, but I want to know why
it needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your science is behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you've been told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just like, uh, Rasta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff said that purple plants are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the rule is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would do some thinking, some
research into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to read this fucking page
because the way that it's printed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, or higher, I just want to make sure
that is still what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I have upped the pH of the water
I'm flushing with to increase the runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: faster or just pass more water through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I have the runoff where I finally
need it, can I immediately finish off the
[SPEAKER_00]: flush with the light feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these plants have gotten
flushed so much recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be needing some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am pretty certain that you have got an
empty rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plate is empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bowl is empty and these plants want
some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've just cleaned the plate,
cleaned out the, uh, the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cocoa doesn't hold a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 50% cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soil is mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't going to hold a lot for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably need some nutrients in
there quite soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm sure you get this a lot,
but I really love your podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a straight shooting dude with a big
heart and you're super easy to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lots of good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, good dude, straight shooting,
big heart, easy to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, keep up the great work,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to get my hands on some good,
I read genetics for my next run or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friend, I just gave you a nice list
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places to get those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do hope you're able to get some,
I read genetics in your garden for the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is spring time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to do the shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, get those seeds popped, get your
plants grown up, get them cloned,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them sexed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if you got boys or girls,
start vegging them out, get them shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: and get that outdoor prepared ASAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants, these plants have been,
uh, through the fucking ringer that had
[SPEAKER_00]: some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pH meter was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flushed the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of fed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flushed them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in shock right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably just want a solid feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what I call a triage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when a bunch of dudes are
looking at a car and the car has got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little problem, it drives me crazy when
it's like eight dudes just going,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be the muffler bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the washer fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are you a mechanic today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hook up a little machine to your
car and it'll say it's the alternator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have that machine for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we look fucking silly standing
around going, I think it's a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we can identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's multiple issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's an environmental issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes why are we going to sit here and
try to figure it out when we can fix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All you gotta do is triage these plants
and do simple, basic rescue techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: get them back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been fucking with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been reflushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of having a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a solid meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we feed them, they're going to settle
back down and get into their routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do what I call the triage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go into your grow and the plants look
like shit and we can't figure out why just
[SPEAKER_00]: by looking, maybe it's a Cal Mag issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've been overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's all of the above and it just
looks like shit in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a few things to correct the room
and the plants right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the triage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the general health checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call it a lot of things,
but first of all, and then in your
[SPEAKER_00]: condition, we're going to, we already know
that this is pH, but in most environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: most situations, I would say, how is the
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any light leaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the temperature of the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obvious signs around the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've corrected all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct all the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's look at the plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the plant living?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to die immediately?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, we can triage it slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got major issues, we may have to
go into critical condition and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: major work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start maybe by removing any terrible
looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant doesn't have to struggle with
those terrible looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we feed it, let's flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to skip this step, but let's
flush the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soil, I don't know what you've been
feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in this case, but I'm saying
hypothetically, if I'm coming into a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up garden, I don't know what you've
been feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's been going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's happening in that root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a runoff test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do all kinds of stuff, but whatever
that runoff test says, I'm still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it one good flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean like a ridiculous,
excessive runoff flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want about 10 to 25% runoff on this
initial flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm basically resetting that rhizosphere,
resetting the media to where all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you fed it, all the shit you locked it up
with is now rinsed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a blank canvas, a blank canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to sneeze as I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the sniffle into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking rude and unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know better, not going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we've got a blank canvas to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is where I would do a triage
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I would mix up just a good,
solid, basic feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my basic mix, there would be base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we in veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we in flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your veg or flour bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the appropriate amount of that in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you using before shit went
wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you using on a good,
successful run?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give me a bottle and I don't know
the brand, I'm probably going to use about
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 to 75% of those base nutrients in my
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it says a hundred, I'm going to put
50 to 75 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the plant health and the
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a little bit and make an
educated decision, but let's start off
[SPEAKER_00]: with the base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need some Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that calcium and magnesium are two
different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys quit saying that it's Cal Mag
deficient, but most of the time they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sold in one bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm contradicting myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's mix in a little bit of Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cal Mag bottle will be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also maybe give it a little bit of
fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some fulvic, that'll help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something like some kelp
products, that may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some microbes will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got base nutrients, we got Cal Mag,
we got fulvic acid, got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got a little bit of recharge in
there just for general health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's feel pH adjust this to about six,
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say six, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said about, let's do it six,
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This general health mix until we get a
little bit of runoff, 10, 15, maybe 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that soil is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's saturated with good nutrients at a
good pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can test that runoff if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, are we growing runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we growing plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the tests, but I'm gonna watch the
plant over the next couple of days and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how it responds to the feeding that we
just gave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that corrected pH and those proper
nutrients are going to rescue that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your rhizosphere, your root zone is in
constant flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute the water hits it, the pH
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute that water starts evaporating,
and drying out, the pH changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every few minutes as it gets a touch drier
in certain areas of that rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't chase that pH constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them fed and get them back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's defoliate any shitty shit that might
be on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's cut off any funky branches that may
be wasting space and energy and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you flushed, then you flushed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you fed them halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're still hungry and full.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's mix up a good feed and feed them a
nice, perfect meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a sick plant just wants a good,
solid, healthy feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pay attention to the plants after
that and not pay so much attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: meters because the meters are what got you
here in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of the toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to use all of that stuff to my
advantage, but sometimes we've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch the plants and we've got to remember
that the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing, I keep saying it,
we're not growing pH meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing minder units or pulse
units.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing cannabis plants,
so pay attention to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing awesome herb before I had
all of this technology and sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder if this technology is messing up my
ability to grow because I catch myself
[SPEAKER_00]: checking data logs, VPD logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be looking at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a nice, solid feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you need to keep flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think flushing has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep flushing them, starve them to
death until they're all yellow and
[SPEAKER_00]: completely fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give them a nice, solid feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like they're taking it,
feed them again the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like something is not working,
let's adjust our feed accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you were giving it a little bit
high pH and you had a pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a pH spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down and do that every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you feed it your triage mix,
write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down how many mils of each bottle
you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what the EC or PPM of the feed
is before you feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, do the test coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens when you feed it coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing that for the next couple of
feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you need to email me again,
send me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can adjust from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think after a couple of feeds,
these plants will rebound and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: will be right back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got four to five weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start flushing in two
weeks anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got these plants back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got a big fat harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get an update from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, hopefully this was a learning
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not rely too much on all of that
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pay more attention to the plants and
less attention to the toys and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump into one more question
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can cover this one up before
this podcast gets too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to be called Fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again came from the grow help tab on
the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick sip here before
we continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to keep listening to my
voice crackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me for one moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm sipping on some pineapple
and coconut juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you're not here to this is not
juice with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about my friend Fox and his
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox is growing underdog OG from th seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, Adam Dunn and th
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys are well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being grown indoors under an led.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is still in the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, we've done a podcast talking
about stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is officially the seedling stage
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're about a couple more,
uh, maybe like a few days a week away from
[SPEAKER_00]: actually saying this may be veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will include a picture somewhere in the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it goes, uh, last feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me catch up to where I was veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What week, not even in a week yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What medium living soil, uh, last feed
about four ounces of recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that little plant didn't need four
ounces of recharge, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temps are okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything is iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily have a problem,
but my question is, is this normal node
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the picture,
it's a little tiny plant that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit stretched, which doesn't have enough
development to have what I would call node
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing, the space between these little
starter leaves, that first set of leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: that second little set of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's coming out, that is
beautiful spacing, but you are barely
[SPEAKER_00]: getting taken off right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I would recommend, uh,
the thing I noticed most that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: comment on is the leggy length between the
cup and the start of the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I would call a very leggy,
stretchy seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seedling is telling me that it wants
more light and that it wants a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume, let's read more
because I do see answers to my questions
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've got questions too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is a node spacing normal or is this
too close?
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked because I watch a lot of videos on
YouTube and their plants always look a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: taller than mine, but at the same,
uh, with the, but at the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes relatively to the day, I have a 50
watt do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: House led, uh, led bulbs with the plastic
cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he explains the bulbs a little
bit, uh, got them on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my plants veg like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if maybe the lights are
too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 20 inches off the floor,
about 12 inches away from the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, or is it too much light for the 18
by 18 veg box?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get this one, I got this one,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pen is to give reference of the space
between nodes, peace and much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the pen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a pen in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Might've been another picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a pen in the background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the pin dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's not focus on the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not here in the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I honestly think that, uh,
the plant looks okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks basically fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be that tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me for being that tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant doesn't have enough growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth should be coming out of the top
of the plant and your growth is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bottom of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you got that long, really long
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's probably six or eight inches
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like, and then you get your
little sprout and then you got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of growth coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could possibly get that light
a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if they start drooping during the day,
then you're getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can raise it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start looking crispy or getting a
little bit dry, you can raise it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the skinniness of that stock and
the lack of growth in that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that it probably wants a
little bit more light than something I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend just to make it grow a
little bit more stout and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a fan on that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you blew some breeze on it,
it would probably make that stick a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more, more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give it a little more,
uh, just it'd be thicker, give it more
[SPEAKER_00]: girth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be just bigger and stronger,
a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to learn to fight that wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to learn just to stay up in the
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be stronger, thicker, just a bigger
fatter plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think the light is too far
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the light, uh, I think it
wants more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant just wants more light
altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: So uh, your veg space wants more light
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, if you can add more light,
I would add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can add more, uh, this is going to
work, but you're going to have stretchy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice if you increase the light,
the plants will stay short and they'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: branchy and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to get tall and skinny and
you won't see a lot of branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to move the microphone away for that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's just keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, to my friend, let's see what you
said your name was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've got your real name on the
screen to my friend Fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, basically I would recommend more
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a, um, a 2,700 Kelvin,
a 5,000 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you basically need more light in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just add more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you can get an led or something
that's a little bit bigger, a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: brighter, I might do that.
