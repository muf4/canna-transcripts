[SPEAKER_10]: Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this
shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, what you gonna do now?
[SPEAKER_12]: What we gonna do right here is go back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before you going back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Way back.
[SPEAKER_12]: As we go a little something like this.
Hit it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Thursday and that means it's time for
another Throwback Thursday episode of the
[SPEAKER_10]: Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we get to the old episodes,
let me make a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I mention any advertising, any
giveaways, any promotions or any contests,
[SPEAKER_10]: all of that stuff has expired.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no advertisements, promotions,
giveaways or contests that are valid in
[SPEAKER_10]: these old episodes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank you guys for listening and
with no further ado, here's a block of old
[SPEAKER_10]: episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time for episode number 126 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_10]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_10]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_10]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_10]: for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I want to thank my buddy,
White Mike, for joining me again.
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing today, brother?
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: I am doing good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that we got this recording equipment
figured out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we spent some time working on the
sound so that this sounded great for all
[SPEAKER_10]: of you out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, 126 episodes into the
show, I opened up the recording software
[SPEAKER_10]: and hit go and the recording equipment was
just giving me the middle finger.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, no, not today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Took a couple of dry runs to get her
going, sounding right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got her fired up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's working good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've done more damage to my head
working on this podcast than I did at like
[SPEAKER_07]: all of the concerts I saw in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_10]: Working well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just said it's working good.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's working well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's work on our English skills today,
class.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, I apologize for the headphone
malfunctions there.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what was going on with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: This equipment today was super loud and
then it was super quiet and then it was
[SPEAKER_10]: extra loud.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys just want a quality show.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's get into that part.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to read some news articles.
[SPEAKER_10]: We may actually play a news article,
but first let's talk about another email
[SPEAKER_10]: that I did not include in the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it might've been a Facebook
message is why I missed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to our friend Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rasta Seb has had a little bit of bad
luck, but things will turn around for your
[SPEAKER_10]: brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel bad for what happened to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Rasta Seb sent me a question asking,
what is reclaim?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can't laugh at the guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to, we got to remember not
everybody is smoking four and five grams
[SPEAKER_10]: of hash on their day off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not everybody lives in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely valid question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Completely good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: No giggles at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people, well, yeah, a lot of people
in Colorado would be like, well,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's a reclaim.
[SPEAKER_10]: Reclaim is this bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for all you folks out there who are not
able to consume a whole bunch of Earl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoiled hash brat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I talked to people all day who have,
like, I don't even bother to get to
[SPEAKER_07]: reclaim with them because like I already
gave them a thesaurus worth of fucking
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: The look on Mike's face was priceless
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me tell you what reclaim is.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we use a dab rig, we put a nail
attached to the rig somehow.
[SPEAKER_10]: It either sits on the outside of a male
joint or it sits on the inside of the male
[SPEAKER_10]: joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you put a dome on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Either way you heat up that nail and then
you put some hash onto there and you
[SPEAKER_10]: inhale.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you inhale, some of that hash oil
will collect onto your rig, just like the
[SPEAKER_10]: resin collects on your pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you doing good so far, Mike?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as we vaporize the hash before it all
gets to us, some of it unvaporizes and
[SPEAKER_07]: reconstitutes itself into a reclaim.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a lot of times that'll fill up
in, if you're smoking a BHO, I highly
[SPEAKER_10]: recommend you using a rig.
[SPEAKER_10]: We call the rig a pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bong.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, it's a small bong.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like a little small bubbler.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a special little hash bong.
[SPEAKER_10]: We call it a rig, but I like something
small.
[SPEAKER_10]: I highly recommend you smoke with
something with water in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want that bubble action to cool it
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: The hash is really hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just cool it a little bit before it gets
to your lungs and throat.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll really help you out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of times the water will collect a
lot of reclaim in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of claim in the water.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of claim on the entryway to
the pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of times I'll use what's called a
drop down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm grabbing my drop down right now to get
a nice visual.
[SPEAKER_10]: The drop down goes onto the rig where the
nail would normally go.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's an extension of glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll actually go a little lower to get
the nail out of your face a little bit and
[SPEAKER_10]: get it further away from your head.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the nail goes on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a lot of the oil, the reclaim oil
will collect right into here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's some here that we can talk
about.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, I don't know, that's probably a
measurement of one dram, one half dram,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think is what that would be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably if you poured it out,
it'd be half a dram.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of those little tiny vials,
they'd be half of one of those is what I
[SPEAKER_10]: think.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got a half a dram of reclaim that
I could remove from here and do something
[SPEAKER_10]: with.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what reclaim is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically reconstituted hash oil
that's stuck to my piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: What can you do with it was one of his
followup questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen people just stick the dabber
inside of this mucky part and pull it out
[SPEAKER_10]: and redab it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people will do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our friend 44, he would do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not against his standards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of people go for dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of people who take great care
to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then try to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Drying it out is the part that I would
make sure you do really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave it on some parchment paper or on an
oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you let it dry really well
before you try to dab it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I talked to one dude who was cleaning his
rig with Everclear so that he could throw
[SPEAKER_07]: that into a glass dish when he was done
agitating and getting his rig all clean
[SPEAKER_07]: and then slowly evaporate that back down
into reclaim powder.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think our friend Gary was teaching me
about that a while back.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out, Gary.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you still listen to the
show, but he was talking about doing
[SPEAKER_10]: something very similar.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our friend Fox with CBD, CBD extracts run
CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what he would say would be to make
edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another use that I know a number of
people do.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already been decar, is it
decarboxylized or decarboxylated?
[SPEAKER_10]: Iced.
[SPEAKER_10]: Iced?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: You look like you just picked one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say you just picked one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said them both in my head and I was
like, no, the first one sounds like.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been decarbed because it's been
heated to a temperature above a certain
[SPEAKER_10]: beyond four.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been heated.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know how hot the surface of
this nail is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is really hot, but it's been heated
above that and it's reconstituted.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's been activated essentially.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you eat it, it's already broken
down so that your body doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_10]: break it down as much to make the
psychoactive components bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that was deep on accident,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what reclaim is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I may be an asshole because what I do with
it is I fill my rig with rubbing alcohol
[SPEAKER_10]: and I shake it up real good.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I pour that down the drain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And ironically, for some reason,
my garbage disposal doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too high, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't eat anything that would really
clog that thing up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't put anything down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need some love.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like 90% sure I need to pour a bottle
of ISO down my garbage disposal.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's my only problem is it's
just all resiny.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a whole bunch of reclaim in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine times out of 10, I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I've got a big fat glob of reclaim
sitting somewhere that's easy to get to,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll use my torch to extract it real
quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of heat it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just heat it up a little bit and turn it
into basically a liquid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then pour it into a silicone
container.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I use it for seasoning my nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great use for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, it's the only reason I keep it
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I only do it when I've got like a
really fat glob sitting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause what I've got now, I could season a
hundred nails with.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to get another question.
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell does he mean season your
nail?
[SPEAKER_10]: When you get a new titanium nail,
just like any skillet that you would want
[SPEAKER_10]: to cook on any pan that you're going to
cook on, you're going to want to put some
[SPEAKER_10]: oil or fatty substance on it to grease it
up before you cook on it so that you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: taste that, uh, that iron, that cast iron.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to just cast iron on
whatever you're cooking.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's, you're making some asparagus in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're making pork chops, you don't
want to taste fucking cast iron and you
[SPEAKER_10]: don't want to just taste raw titanium.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I get a new nail, I'll heat it up
just to about dab temperature and I'll let
[SPEAKER_10]: it cool so that the nail, so that the oil
will puddle on there and kind of soak into
[SPEAKER_10]: the pores of the nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to kind of season your nail
before you start dabbing with the brand
[SPEAKER_10]: new titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can do it with quartz also.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, once you get a quartz nail perfectly
seasoned, uh, it's so smooth and tastes
[SPEAKER_10]: really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally got to hit a really nice quartz
banger recently and it tasted really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, shout out to a Bobo Blaster Co and the
traveling stoner and sloppy nine one nine
[SPEAKER_10]: and whoever else, uh, Buzzy probably was
in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know where you were bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, did I give a shout out to Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave a shout out to Lindsay on the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: The episode came out really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You did a great job on the show and Mike,
you were awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, we're going to get Mike and Lindsay
back on another episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, a listener sent a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I wasn't even prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me grab my phone and we'll read a
Facebook message right quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was a fun show to record.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some good feedback on it from some
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: This Facebook message stemmed from that
episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pulling it up on my phone right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is impromptu.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was not prepared to talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to wait till you guys are both
here, but, uh, it seems like a fair time
[SPEAKER_10]: to mention this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: This comment.
[SPEAKER_10]: She said, Oh, and she has replied to my
reply.
[SPEAKER_10]: She said, I listened to this podcast and
was sad to hear that the libertarian
[SPEAKER_10]: candidates were ignored or were entirely
ignored.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gary Johnson is way better than Sanders on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnson, besides owning an extract
company, even admits to using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when Hillary Bertz beats Bernie,
which she will, and then she leaves us a
[SPEAKER_10]: link to follow so that we can read about a
libertarian future.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm, uh, I'm very familiar with Gary
Johnson.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm just a realist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Gary's awesome, but, uh, Gary don't
have a shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, she said, thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually rooting for Bernie for the
dem nomination, but my heart is with Gary
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnson.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said, it's not totally impossible
for Gary Johnson.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, I don't know enough about that to
have an opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like Mike does.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I do have an opinion on is that,
um, Elizabeth, I appreciate your
[SPEAKER_10]: interaction with the podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ever have any more questions or
anything you'd like to say, feel free to
[SPEAKER_10]: throw it up there on the Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: The, the libertarian candidate is
typically far better on marijuana policy
[SPEAKER_07]: than the Democrat or the Republican
candidates, but, uh, they don't have a
[SPEAKER_07]: shot right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we just don't have that third party
infrastructure in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike knows a lot of political shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a buzzword champion, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I listened to the episode because of
course I cleaned them up a little bit
[SPEAKER_10]: before I put them out.
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody pauses for too long or says
shit they want taken out, I'll cut it out
[SPEAKER_10]: for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, listening back to that episode,
you were buzzword King.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just getting my mind every time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, we talked about reclaim.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Hey Seb, I owe you one, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: You helped me out one time, uh,
by contributing to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like you may be in a time of
need.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's anything that Mike and I can do
for you, Mike, I just volunteered your
[SPEAKER_10]: services to our buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can do anything for you,
bro, let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I owe you one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what we could do,
but if something comes up that you think
[SPEAKER_10]: of, send me an email, send me a Facebook
message.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, our next article, our next topic is
going to be a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to go to the internet for
this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually going to play a quick video
clip from channel 13 news here in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado and Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it says I should give credit to Katie
Spencer, who is a multimedia journalist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the cannabis clubs in Colorado Springs
United and did something great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, they were giving away free joints to
people who volunteered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was this all of them or was this some of
them?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a small group.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a group of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was more than one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure it was more than one.
[SPEAKER_10]: The article should tell us, but I saw our
friends from one shop posting about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I saw the guy on this news articles
from another shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know how many of the places
participated, but I'll play the news
[SPEAKER_10]: article first.
[SPEAKER_10]: For you.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what they did was they were giving
away a free joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you participated in their litter
cleanup program, if you went and picked up
[SPEAKER_10]: one bag of trash and brought it back to
the organizer of this event, he would give
[SPEAKER_10]: you a free joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's an image of him standing here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, he's standing in the park
with a bowl of dude tubes full of joints.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got the joints aren't exposed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in little containers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if I would have organized this event,
it would be an organized slightly
[SPEAKER_07]: different, but I love it for what it is
and what it did for the community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's not a hundred percent like put
your best foot forward necessarily as far
[SPEAKER_07]: as optics go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but, uh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do joints for picking up trash all the
way, clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if you could smoke the joint
while you pick up trash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause that'd make it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can't do that though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not legally in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the whole thing with Hannah and
about, cause I'm sure plenty of people did
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was just bring me a bag of trash,
get a joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there were plenty of people who
brought him several bags of trash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder how many people went and cleaned
out their car.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope not many.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but, uh, I'd like to see, see more of
the industry doing stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the consumption clubs can really push
the boundaries with like giving away
[SPEAKER_07]: product and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the shops can't even give away
product legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to charge at least a penny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only way a dispensary would be able to
do that would to be if they checked your
[SPEAKER_10]: ID before they let you sign up for the
program, and then they would have to give
[SPEAKER_10]: you a coupon that may give you a joint for
a penny because they can't give you
[SPEAKER_10]: anything for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then you'd have to go back to that
shop and get the joint for a penny with
[SPEAKER_07]: your coupons.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then didn't you just technically
you're employed by that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that happens, you're like kind of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they're just handing out coupons.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's who they hand coupons to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you could claim that's
employment, but like, I'm sure that a
[SPEAKER_07]: stink would get raised if a dispensary
actually did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Too many hoops to jump through for the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody would take tax money on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: All sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the shop would have to pay the taxes
on that as though it's sold at normal
[SPEAKER_07]: price.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the bite that the shop would
have to take.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like there's a shop down here that's
adopted a strip of highway and I drive
[SPEAKER_07]: that strip of highway every day and it's
always fucking filthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I shake my head every time I drive and
see that sign.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they need to get out there and clean it
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's their part of the highway,
their little redheaded stepchild part of
[SPEAKER_10]: the highway is all dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out there and fulfill your
obligations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And shout out to the shop, the consumption
clubs that did this event.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish more of the industry was thinking
of stuff like this to help clean up or
[SPEAKER_07]: better their little part of the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to play the video.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to get the volumes correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize if things go wonky here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how loud this is going to be
because it is coming from the news 13
[SPEAKER_10]: website.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll deal with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Colorado Springs Cannabis Club
offering free marijuana today to those who
[SPEAKER_00]: helped pick up trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dozens of volunteers showed up to help the
Pothole Cannabis Club clean up Vermejo
[SPEAKER_00]: Park and other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And KRDO News Channel 13's Katie Spencer
tagged along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new at five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal of Sunday's get together,
making Colorado Springs more beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: one trash bag at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go out here on the west
side and clean up down here off of
[SPEAKER_06]: Cimarron and the park off of 26th.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effort started here at Vermejo Park
where volunteers were picking up trash for
[SPEAKER_01]: a unique reward.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you bring bags of trash back to me,
I'm going to give you a joint per bag you
[SPEAKER_06]: bring back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those cleaning up, it wasn't just
about the free weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hike every single day and I see trash on
every single trail and it saddens me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a personal connection to their
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels good to actually go pick the
trash up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't mind it because I use
the trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cleaning up the park as well as the
reputation of the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: To show that we are a positive impact.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's nothing wrong with weed
and there's nothing wrong with our kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado Springs, Katie Spencer,
KRDO News Channel 13.
[SPEAKER_10]: They picked up a lot of trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: To continue the cleanups every month and
move to other parts of the city.
[SPEAKER_10]: So every month, that'd be cool to see
people picking up trash for pot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that shows you guys, we're not just
about a bunch of lazy stoners.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do contribute to the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want it to be cleaner.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're at the park chilling out,
enjoying our buzz.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want it to be clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to look around and see trash
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this weird myth out there that
because we're associated with marijuana,
[SPEAKER_07]: like we want everything to be bad and
destroyed and stoned or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like bad people and it's just
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're people just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_07]: We like cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing I've noticed being around
potheads a lot for the past 20 years is a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of them have OCD.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially, and I may sound sexist,
but this is just what I've observed.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of women get, got to clean some shit
OCD.
[SPEAKER_10]: They get stoned and they're like,
Oh, those dishes are dirty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just go clean the dishes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not, it's just cause in their
mind, they're like, those dishes can't be
[SPEAKER_10]: dirty.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's driving me crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they do the damn dishes and potheads
get the same OCD.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like there's trash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to pick it up, make my environment
look good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just easier and more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a Boy Scout back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was important to the people around
me that like when we went camping,
[SPEAKER_07]: not only did we do zero impact camping,
so like, or leave no trace camping,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like we actively pay attention and
grab other trash while we're out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we always had one pocket full of
other people's bullshit, like on the way
[SPEAKER_07]: back to camp at night, just so that next
time we were up there, it was a little
[SPEAKER_07]: better than it was this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I do it at my house too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when it's been crazy, windy down
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So every night when I get home,
I spend like two minutes picking up other
[SPEAKER_07]: people's trash out of my front yard.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should put up a net.
[SPEAKER_10]: The past few days we've needed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: A trash net would be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to give a shout out to Four Pieces.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you follow at Four Pieces on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure their website and stuff,
but if you check them out on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_10]: Four Pieces is an organization that
encourages you to pick up four pieces of
[SPEAKER_10]: trash per day.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter where you find them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it kind of does.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to go take them out of the
dumpster or some shit, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: do your part, pick up four pieces of trash
per day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a picture of it, post it up on Four
Pieces, encourage other people to pick up
[SPEAKER_10]: four pieces of trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm continuously blown away by shit I see
out in the public.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what's the Starbucks cup doing in my
parking lot?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it wasn't there 20 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go on hikes and I find the weirdest shit
on hikes and I'll be far from like the car
[SPEAKER_10]: or wherever there is, I'm far from it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, how did people bring a fucking
pie and some forks out here?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what were these people doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why couldn't they just take their pie
container back?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie container and a bunch of plastic
forks.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I found a stop sign out in the middle
of nowhere one time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just cleaning your shit up.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are way off on a tangent here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know how we ended up in this
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the news article picking up trash for
joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, yeah, think it all the way
through, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's not give out the joints in the park
next time.
[SPEAKER_10]: That looked a little weird on the news
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one thing that everybody sort
of has against the consumption clubs is
[SPEAKER_07]: that some of them have found a way to do
some sort of distribution and we're giving
[SPEAKER_07]: joints away in the park for bringing us
bags of trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's an awesome program.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting people to clean up trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care how you do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to jump in and interrupt you and
do my part for the consumption clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to avoid the word distribution.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: We would much rather hear the word
reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and I'm just educating you and our
listeners so that when you, if you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: come to a consumption club, don't say
purchase, don't say buy, say, may I
[SPEAKER_10]: reimburse you for some of that fine
quality product there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like reimbursement is the key word in
these places.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why it's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you fuckers vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sick of word games.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just call them all fuckers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just talking about headshots.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't mean it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just talking about how some head
shops in Colorado are still playing the
[SPEAKER_07]: water pipe game because they have to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's because enough of our generation
isn't voting regularly.
[SPEAKER_10]: The water pipe game.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to find the water pipe game
because some people might not.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you come into my marijuana store,
I'm happy to show you the bongs on my
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf and tell you how much my bongs cost.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if the head shop up the road shows you
the exact same thing, they're not allowed
[SPEAKER_07]: to call it a bong because if it's a bong,
it might be used for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's used for marijuana,
it's not really legal, legal to sell.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still against federal law because you
called it a bong.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 2016.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be able to say, can I check out
that bong?
[SPEAKER_07]: It really, really is 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be saying, can I get that rig?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sick of the word games.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's legal in Colorado now, and there are
still places where you have to say water
[SPEAKER_07]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a huge advocate for consumption
clubs and learning another word game makes
[SPEAKER_07]: that harder.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that segues into my next news
article because you said consumption clubs
[SPEAKER_10]: and you're a big fan.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this article says, this is from the
Indy, the Colorado Springs independent.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was by Nat Stein.
[SPEAKER_10]: The article headline says city council
bans cannabis clubs knowing full well
[SPEAKER_10]: lawsuit is coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was shocking news because just a
few days ago we were told they had eight
[SPEAKER_10]: years to get their shit together to recoup
their investments.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really weird decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're too dangerous to be open,
but they have eight years to recoup their
[SPEAKER_07]: expenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, well, which is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: So the article goes a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice trying to hide that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that real well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to cover that up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, those Mountain Dew cans are fucking
fierce.
[SPEAKER_10]: You call them fuckers and cheers bitches.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're having a great night, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I drank this whole- Just like one in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just glad to be getting the show
recorded at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gingerade kombucha.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know, there might,
I might, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel strange from it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to say there's alcohol in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like every time you drink, I see random
things floating in the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kombucha.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I have a nice little kombucha buzz
going on to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, this article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: A marathon session at City Holland,
whose day featured city council dissenters
[SPEAKER_10]: of all stripes, those who pushed back on
counselor Andy Pico's proposed resolution,
[SPEAKER_10]: opposing refugee settlement, those who
delivered a petition demanding repeal of
[SPEAKER_10]: the recently enacted pedestrian access
act, those who bemoaned the promos land
[SPEAKER_10]: swap deal with the Broadmoor, and finally
those pleading once again for council to
[SPEAKER_10]: keep the cannabis clubs unshuttered.
[SPEAKER_10]: None of that resolved except for the club
issue, but not in a way most had urged.
[SPEAKER_10]: The clubs, which were membership-based
social clubs that allow for adult
[SPEAKER_10]: marijuana use, have caused consternation
for city officials for several years now.
[SPEAKER_10]: They first started springing up after
voter approved amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2013, 2014, excuse me, studio A-64 won
a zoning violation appeal in which the
[SPEAKER_10]: city granted the downtown club a similar
use determination.
[SPEAKER_10]: In essence, saying that cannabis clubs are
like social clubs, so are areas zoned as
[SPEAKER_10]: such.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in parentheses, it says permitted
in multifamily residential, commercial,
[SPEAKER_10]: and industrial zone districts.
[SPEAKER_10]: More clubs opened up all over town.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even after the six-month moratorium on new
marijuana business licensing began in
[SPEAKER_10]: September, the city couldn't stop issuing
a license that did not exist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then earlier this month, the planning
commission recommended banning the clubs
[SPEAKER_10]: outright.
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Don Knight took the ordinance to
council, proposing the group prohibit the
[SPEAKER_10]: opening of any new clubs, mandate
licensure for all clubs that operated
[SPEAKER_10]: prior to the moratorium, subject to all
sorts of new rules, and force those clubs
[SPEAKER_10]: to close doors after eight years.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the ordinance council gave a final
reading on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Bill Murray moved to the table
the ordinance for six months, so council
[SPEAKER_10]: could work with the industry to develop
more moderate regulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the end, council voted six to three in
favor of adopting Knight's original
[SPEAKER_10]: proposal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselors Jill Gabler and Helen Collins
joined Murray in voting no.
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about limited government all the
time, but limited government is not about
[SPEAKER_10]: number of employees.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about limited laws, Murray said.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're turning democracy into a morality
play.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gabler said she was skeptical of the
public process behind the measure or lack
[SPEAKER_10]: thereof.
[SPEAKER_10]: Collins, on her part, said she didn't
think a ban would be constitutional.
[SPEAKER_10]: Knight and Counselor Keith King both
argued that council had already exercised
[SPEAKER_10]: its right under amendment 64 to opt out of
the retail side of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Knight cited articles from the Gazette and
Fox News as proof.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those articles highlight the club 's
practice of offering marijuana to patrons
[SPEAKER_10]: who didn't bring their own, sometimes in
exchange for a donation or reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_10]: Assisting other adult in the use of
marijuana is permissible under act 64,
[SPEAKER_10]: is what this article says.
[SPEAKER_10]: This article is written in two different
colors, so I apologize for my stutter.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes my eyes jump around when it's in
two colors like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do that if you type some shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's rude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Club owners and goers took their
opportunity during basic public comment to
[SPEAKER_10]: try and correct some misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Amber Rasick, owner of studio A64,
insisted that cannabis clubs are benign
[SPEAKER_10]: relative to bars that serve alcohol.
[SPEAKER_10]: She says, I get off at 1 a.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: in the morning and every time I drive
downtown, I see people outside the bar,
[SPEAKER_10]: stumbling around, causing problems,
getting into fights.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are peaceful people, she said.
[SPEAKER_10]: All we want is a place to be accepted as
human beings.
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoking weed is how we choose to relax,
and it isn't hurting one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Presence Mercier, I hope I said that
right, patron and cousin of a local club
[SPEAKER_10]: owner, took a different tack.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if you hate pot, that's fine,
she said, but we all love money,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about what you'd gain from these
clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's such a good point.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's kind of a tasteless way to
say it, but I mean, it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about all the money that you're
going to miss out on if they close all of
[SPEAKER_10]: these clubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shutting down a bunch of businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you lose a lot more than the sales
tax, payroll tax, property tax,
[SPEAKER_07]: business tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then all of the money that those
employees go spend back in your community.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and all of this is silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there are places in the world that
already have these clubs zoned and
[SPEAKER_07]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pueblo counties happens to be one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado Springs isn't one, so they're
pretending like it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because they're refusing to throw
rules down and just be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_07]: follow these, apply here and be done with
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be doing this nonsense
for the next half decade.
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to figure out that loophole of
how people can reimburse the club for the
[SPEAKER_10]: product that they use there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the only, that seems to be the...
Or like the club has to have a way to
[SPEAKER_07]: survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, a lot of the rules that are
in place are like, they can't do anything
[SPEAKER_07]: other than sell pre-packaged drinks and
snacks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can't even do like cold
sandwiches, let alone like decent food.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: No way to reimburse for the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you pay your rent at that point,
right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you exist as an entity?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how far out in the middle of
nowhere do they want to push it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like eventually it's just going to be like
it, like cousin Earl's farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that's pointless.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just need, we like having a place in
the congregating area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some dude with 50 acres and a big house
and a barn in the middle of it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: just slap up an ad on the internet.
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, I've been in those
situations.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been out in the middle of nowhere
smoking because we had to hide.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been to gatherings in every
environment you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: From some random dude's house to some
hippie's house, to some gangster's house,
[SPEAKER_10]: to I've been in every environment smoking.
[SPEAKER_10]: And those social clubs are the ideal,
safest environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing's going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not on somebody's turf.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in a club.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You paid the entry fee.
[SPEAKER_10]: You showed us your ID.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're part of our club.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have anything against you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody here is in a different club.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a video that I saw years and
years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where they're interviewing a coffee shop
owner in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what the consumption clubs in
Amsterdam are called.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, he's been open for like 15
years and he goes, there's never been a
[SPEAKER_07]: fight in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the bar across the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: The police are there every night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, it's just a different,
it's a different type of intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't come with that aggressive
tinge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see anti-pop people linking like anytime
there's a violent incident and marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: gets mentioned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they post it up as though it was
directly caused by.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, then you wouldn't
have had to go to Texas to find this
[SPEAKER_07]: story.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like your town sold $17 million worth of
weed last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if it was being caused, you could
link that article from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problems with the clubs are just,
they annoy people that really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really hate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the biggest problem caused by
allowing consumption clubs is that you
[SPEAKER_07]: annoy the squeaky wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it a few years.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're old.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's never been a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's never been any trouble there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to continue with this article.
[SPEAKER_10]: Joking that being from Denver shouldn't be
held against him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Activist attorney Rob Corey reminded
council that amendment 64, which he had a
[SPEAKER_10]: hand in drafting, protects the activities
in question.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Colorado, adults have the right to
associate with each other, consume
[SPEAKER_10]: marijuana, cultivate it, distribute it,
and help others with all of those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, that's the supreme law of the
land.
[SPEAKER_10]: The voters have spoken.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just like the other constitutional
rights, which council members swore to
[SPEAKER_10]: uphold, the rights afforded by amendment
20 and amendment 64 are non-negotiable,
[SPEAKER_10]: Corey said.
[SPEAKER_10]: That may be difficult for you,
but that is the reality.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jill Gaber asked Corey how other
municipalities in the state are dealing
[SPEAKER_10]: with cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a single one has banned them because
they can't, he answered.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus a city devoid of venues for social
consumption creates other problems,
[SPEAKER_10]: he explained.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marijuana will be smoked by adults in
groups, no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't prevent me from inviting 50 of
my closest friends over to smoke pot
[SPEAKER_10]: together.
[SPEAKER_10]: So where are they going to go?
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they banned the clubs, we'll just open
the front door, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just come on everybody and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come just take some dabs in my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start dabbling with some
really interesting people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go that route.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's part of the beauty of the
club.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that because I would go to the club
once or twice a week.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would make an effort to show up once a
week or so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I got to about once every two
weeks during trim time because we were
[SPEAKER_10]: just busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: But once or twice a week, I'll pop in
there and try to spend an hour there and
[SPEAKER_10]: say hi to people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would always meet new people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes I'd meet people that I wish
would walk away.
[SPEAKER_10]: But most of the time I would meet people
that I'd be like, damn, I'm glad I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: friends with that guy now.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like most of the people I've met in the
community and I wish I could spend more
[SPEAKER_07]: time with the consumption clubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I haven't felt that way about a bar in
forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the great area they exist and just
annoys the shit out of me at this point in
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just ridiculous at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the more people don't see this
ridiculous, it's starting to really annoy
[SPEAKER_07]: me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said this so many times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't we have so many bars,
but we can't have somewhere to smoke
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems unfair.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they voted to regulate it like
cannabis or like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: The retort that I always get for that is,
well, you can enjoy one alcoholic beverage
[SPEAKER_07]: without getting any sort of intoxication.
[SPEAKER_07]: But every time you consume cannabis,
it's to get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, sort of, but you can
also consume a small amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: and get no high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do it consuming large amounts of
cannabis products when I'm consuming
[SPEAKER_07]: straight CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: My first couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just like, that's medical consumers
like you and me, like one or two high THC
[SPEAKER_07]: dabs, there's still no intoxication.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just all sort of painkill.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to make that argument as though most
people don't go to the bar for more than
[SPEAKER_07]: one drink or to feel some sort of ease,
relief of stress or blow off some steam or
[SPEAKER_07]: get a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been aware of the phrase three
martini lunch since I was like five.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a nonsense argument,
but I hear it day after day from elected
[SPEAKER_07]: officials, people in suits, people whose
opinions being printed in the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's unfair.
[SPEAKER_10]: How come you guys have somewhere to hang
out and congregate and drink one drink,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I don't have somewhere to hang out and
congregate and take one dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same damn thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to continue because there's one
more paragraph.
[SPEAKER_10]: It says,
[SPEAKER_10]: at the end of his statement, it's the
27th, and it's not a date for that.
So we're still in court.
And I'm not in court on this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a specific exception to the claim
that council has no right to ban cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will talk about that in court,
Corey said.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when this happened, they had four days
to draft the new rules and have the city
[SPEAKER_10]: attorney sign them is what I was told.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that should have happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the day for that signing would be
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as soon as that signed.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as the paper was signed is when
the lawsuit went into.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the 27th is when the paper will be
signed and that's when the lawsuit will
[SPEAKER_10]: kick in is what I think I was told.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting to watch this one
play out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It sure will.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want these clubs to get closed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be able to go hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have rules for them down here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just none of them are open because
essentially the rules mean it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be a huge upfront investment and the rules
also mean they've got to make that
[SPEAKER_07]: investment back with a quarter profit
apiece on like pre-packaged bags of chips
[SPEAKER_07]: and bottled water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's insane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And those buildings are expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: That part of most parts of Colorado
Springs right now are really expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got one more news article I want
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I want to mention something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody was reading a CBD article from
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody was sharing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The article was a hoax, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It got all this riled up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was looking at it a little further.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that actual article was a hoax.
[SPEAKER_07]: 99% of it's a hoax.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's based on a truth though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the FDA did set out warning letters
to different CBD companies, but it was my
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding that a lot of them were the
ones you and me were warning people about
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple of months back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chinese nonsense companies that are
like two drops of this will cure your
[SPEAKER_07]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they test it and it's pure
codfish oil or some shit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I read an article on Facebook that
was saying that the FDA sent out a letter
[SPEAKER_10]: saying that all CBD products were banned
because it was now FDA regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was not true.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a hoax.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you guys saw that, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_10]: That shit was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It may come down the pipeline in the
future.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as of this time, that was a hoax.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was click bait.
[SPEAKER_10]: People were trying to get you a click and
I bought the bait.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I read it, I was like, this isn't
written well.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to do some research.
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in a few episodes ago, continuingly,
we've been talking about a raid that
[SPEAKER_10]: happened in Santa Ana, California,
when some police officers raided a
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensary that was open and full of
customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't know which raid we're talking
about, hit pause real quick and Google
[SPEAKER_07]: Santa Ana police dispensary raid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that should bring the video right up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these cops were caught on camera
destroying this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: They ate what I thought was edibles on
camera, but this article covers a little
[SPEAKER_10]: bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tries to back them up a little bit on
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say that they were eating edibles.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_10]: This article kind of defends them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The headline says Santa Ana cops in
notorious pot eating video charged with
[SPEAKER_10]: petty theft and vandalism.
[SPEAKER_10]: The article is by Nick Shu.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the headline calls it the pot eating
video, we can go ahead and be solid on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like they were eating edibles in
the video.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would still say those were edibles.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was edible something.
[SPEAKER_10]: This article is from the OC Weekly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Orange County district attorney's
office has filed charges against three of
[SPEAKER_10]: the police officers seen in a notorious
video eating pot laced candy bars during a
[SPEAKER_10]: May 26th, 2015 raid in a Santa Ana medical
marijuana dispensary called sky high
[SPEAKER_10]: holistic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sentence was hard for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_10]: The video first posted by OC Weekly last
June clearly showed officers passing
[SPEAKER_10]: around candy bars, joking about feeling
lightheaded and tossing darts after
[SPEAKER_10]: finishing their Scooby snack.
[SPEAKER_10]: The shocking footage of the sky high cops
went viral leading to nationwide and
[SPEAKER_10]: international news reports.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet in its official announcement of the
misdemeanor charges filed today,
[SPEAKER_10]: the OCDA claims there is no evidence that
any of the Santa Ana police department
[SPEAKER_10]: officers shown in the video consumed
marijuana products during the raid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, they're being prosecuted for
causing intentional damage to legally
[SPEAKER_10]: disabled video cameras and eating detour
sample protein bars and Mr. Thinster
[SPEAKER_10]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were not marijuana laced products on
sale at the dispensary, but were simply
[SPEAKER_10]: snacks available to staff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate the word laced.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate the word laced too, but basically
the good news is charges were filed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bad news is because the video footage
is so grainy, the cops are claiming that
[SPEAKER_07]: what they were consuming were non-infused
products that the store had on hand for
[SPEAKER_07]: staff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of their charges, if I remember
correctly, is stealing those food items.
[SPEAKER_10]: The officers named in the OCDA
announcement as facing petty theft charges
[SPEAKER_10]: for eating the supposedly non-pot laced
candy bars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I want to stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't say laced.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you put it in there on purpose and it's
being sold as laced is hiding it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Laced is when you put some, when you take
a joint and you put some special sprinkles
[SPEAKER_10]: in there and you don't tell somebody and
they smoke it and like, yo, I'm fucked up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're like, yeah, it was laced.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's laced.
[SPEAKER_10]: Infused is what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're purposely putting this product in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lacing only happens in crazy people's
minds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's mostly a myth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely not what dispensaries do
to get their customers stoned.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lacing doesn't happen in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: So non-pot infused candy bars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: The officer's name in the OCDA
announcement is facing petty theft charges
[SPEAKER_10]: for eating the supposedly non-pot infused
candy bars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our Brandon Matthew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we want to read all their names?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to glorify them by reading
their names.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another officer also faces an additional
count of vandalism for damaging the
[SPEAKER_10]: disabled video cameras and allegedly
smashing their lenses into the corner of a
[SPEAKER_10]: display case and cash register.
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy's an extra dick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_10]: He gets an extra charge.
[SPEAKER_10]: The three defendants are accused of
consuming the food items and sharing the
[SPEAKER_10]: protein bars with other SAPD personnel.
[SPEAKER_10]: The press release states before leaving
the premises at the conclusion of the
[SPEAKER_10]: search warrant, two officers, I can't even
say one of their names are accused of
[SPEAKER_10]: taking extra cookies with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The DA's office says it concluded a
thorough investigation of the incident,
[SPEAKER_10]: including the careful review of more than
16 hours of unedited video surveillance
[SPEAKER_10]: footage with cooperation of the SAPD.
[SPEAKER_10]: While other SAPD personnel like the bald
cop seen in the video saying he felt
[SPEAKER_10]: lightheaded after eating one of them,
ate some protein bars, there is
[SPEAKER_10]: insufficient evidence that they knew the
food items belonged to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_10]: not their fellow officers, the release
states.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was also no evidence that any SAPD
personnel consumed any edible marijuana
[SPEAKER_10]: items available at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Admit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They expect us to believe this shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the article even says, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: No evidence whatsoever, other than the
fact that the cops were at a pot shop
[SPEAKER_10]: eating candy bars and acting high.
[SPEAKER_10]: One is then left with the obvious
conclusion that these poor officers are so
[SPEAKER_10]: underpaid that they have no choice but to
munch down on pilfered protein bars while
[SPEAKER_10]: on duty.
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes so much more sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they broke in, they smashed
everything, and they were like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, Chaz brought cookies, like to their
military style, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you've seen the video.
[SPEAKER_07]: They jumped out of their SWAT car and
their SWAT gear, and they fucking bang
[SPEAKER_07]: open and unlock fucking door by kicking it
the wrong way a bunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Screaming, yelling at everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, what, the dude in the
back had cookies?
[SPEAKER_07]: Motherfucker, how high are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how little attention do they have?
[SPEAKER_07]: They think we're paying.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sit there in the video and talk about
how they're all woozy from eating the
[SPEAKER_07]: protein bars they stole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, when you see the video and then you
look at these charges and it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: okay, the rest of that was just legal,
common procedure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how is that common?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it also says, if convicted on all
counts, the trio of uninformed snack
[SPEAKER_10]: fiends faces between six months and one
year in jail plus fines.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they do get, if they do go to court,
they do get a jury.
[SPEAKER_10]: The jury is going to watch this video and
convict them if they get real people on
[SPEAKER_10]: the jury, if they don't fucking fix that
jury up real nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of want to see what happens to
these guys if they go to jail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cops don't do well in jail.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but I could, I've seen
plenty of movies to know that cops are not
[SPEAKER_10]: going to do well in jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: The behavior is so egregious and we've
seen it for so long in this community.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a raid for a dispensary or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they come back the day after the raid
with video cameras and everything's
[SPEAKER_07]: broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everything, everything, the walls,
the lights, the light bulbs, the
[SPEAKER_07]: doorknobs, everything's destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The carpets ripped up, electrical wiring
is destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, you were serving a
search warrant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a display of aggression.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just came in, destroyed everything in
baths.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't even arrest anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: No charges were filed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just came in, took everything,
destroyed everything that isn't worth
[SPEAKER_07]: taking and left.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's not law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's piracy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's terrorism.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the public's cool with it
because they're doing it to the stoners.
[SPEAKER_10]: The stoners that worked hard to open a
business and to help and contribute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God there hasn't been a lot of these
raids in Colorado, but I see them
[SPEAKER_07]: regularly in other States where a business
is invested years, millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_07]: get up running, start getting successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the cops come in, destroy
everything, take everything worth money
[SPEAKER_07]: and bounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a year later, no one's been charged
with anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the store is back up and running
again.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, from my perspective, that's why
they don't want us to use banks because
[SPEAKER_07]: there's more paperwork to seize a bank
account than to just snatch the saves.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hadn't thought about it that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds accurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more cash in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can just come get it and buy
themselves more armored vehicles and
[SPEAKER_10]: humvees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: These aren't necessarily the opinions of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the opinions of what Mike has
said.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might support your statements,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I bring you on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I don't mind waiting for hours
in line to vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because I started paying attention
and the more I paid attention,
[SPEAKER_07]: the more it caught my attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the more I saw, the more pissed I got.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Start reading the news in your area,
folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike, you should just do mic drops.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should just take that mic right out of
the stand to start dropping it
[SPEAKER_10]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had enough gear problems without me
breaking the microphone.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So speaking of gear problems, let me see
how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm guessing about 33 minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't looked.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are at 44 minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to my friend, 44.
[SPEAKER_10]: 44 and two is your new name, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast
lately, but you've earned the new name of
[SPEAKER_10]: 44 and two.
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one was that ticket.
[SPEAKER_10]: And number two was your recent adventure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So 44 and two is your new name,
tough guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's all the podcasts we got for
you today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry I had to make it a late night for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy to, my man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Late nights to get these shows in are the
name of the game right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the job.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys enjoyed, because we worked
pretty hard to bring a good one to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to try to come up some smart
ass to say, but I didn't have shit for
[SPEAKER_10]: you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Too many dabs to be a smart ass at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a lot to say here at the end
of the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any sponsors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you check out the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, that's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_10]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you in the next one.

[SPEAKER_07]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_10]: See you in the next

[SPEAKER_08]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_07]: See you in the next one.

[SPEAKER_08]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_10]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So two of those is 70.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good dose for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: For a renal to function and have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to eat the whole hundred milligram
monkey bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the 350 milligram peanut butter
bar from Mountain Medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things are good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like 50 used to be my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like eight, nine months ago, 50 was my
sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, just recently there was like
20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an empty stomach day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of popped them without thinking
while I was doing chores around the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I caught myself doing laundry,
like super into folding the towels.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fried.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to give a huge shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maddie made pot tarts.
[SPEAKER_10]: She made medicated jelly.
[SPEAKER_10]: The jelly straight up had hash oil in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she made like doughy crust,
like pop tart crust that was medicated as
[SPEAKER_10]: well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she made frosting that was
medicated as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she gave me a good size portion for my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tried to drive to work and it kicked
in about three quarters of the way to
[SPEAKER_10]: work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, what just happened?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I was like, something just went
weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, did my car just break down?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, did I just get a flat tire?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did the wind just kick in?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did the earth just die?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause suddenly everything was just like,
that was weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maddie wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many milligrams were in
that edible, but shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing was fucking tremendous,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a hard day at work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything got done at half speed.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some of the strongest waxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy who made it had an outdoor grill
and he let it cure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had this great smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the trim was all cured when he blew
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kicking myself for not bringing some
for you to try.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I made the coconut oil
with.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's some of the strongest I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not like the best I've ever
had, but it's the strongest.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the biggest dose of edibles you've
ever taken?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the 350 Mountain Medicine bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was episode 36.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of the earlier ones,
but yeah, it was a funny show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to Mountain Medicine too.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really cost-effective,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're affordable and they deliver.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: So somebody say something important.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually had a purpose behind this
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a topic at hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just fun rambling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we got a couple of comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got two more things I have to cover and
then I'll unleash you guys on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me, since I took that dab,
shout out to Higher Elevated... I took a
[SPEAKER_10]: dab, so bear with my brain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Higher Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the name of the place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also Elevate Glass Gallery in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Higher Elevation Masterpiece Production
can repair your broken rig.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will fix your broken glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will hook you up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Search for them on the internet or call
them 719-646.
[SPEAKER_10]: 5352.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can fix your broken rig.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool ass people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is Higher Elevation Masterpiece
Productions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And their sister store, is that what you
call it?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's her sister store,
their homie store, their partner store,
[SPEAKER_10]: the other store down the way is Elevate.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one is on 517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Both are really cool shops.
[SPEAKER_10]: I recommend them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The people are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: The customer service is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a great selection of
affordable rigs.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got brand name rigs.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got Hitman rigs in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got D-nails in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got highly educated titanium
products.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a product in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe I didn't buy while I was
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got the highly educated nail with
the ceramic, or not ceramic, with the
[SPEAKER_10]: quartz dish on top.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you got the titanium base with the
quartz dish on top.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much indestructible if you take
care of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go get that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a bad ass piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, shout out to those places.
[SPEAKER_10]: I support them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I recommend them if you're in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also one more big important message.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been advertising this secret session
420.
[SPEAKER_10]: Change of plans.
[SPEAKER_10]: Secret session is now on 421 because of
some logistics in the city of Denver and
[SPEAKER_10]: things that go on when you're trying to
plan a cannabis event and people try to be
[SPEAKER_10]: fucktards.
[SPEAKER_10]: But secret session on 421.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you support that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Email me for more information or follow,
I think it's Secret Session Colorado on
[SPEAKER_10]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's all of the advertising and
butt kissing I've got to do for the start
[SPEAKER_10]: of the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we can get into the topics that
I've invited these young men here for.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a steel cage match.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just looked at both these guys like I
was about to ask them if they're ready to
[SPEAKER_10]: fight.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the reason that these guys wanted to
get together, they actually both messaged
[SPEAKER_10]: me wanting to do a podcast on this topic.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I love the initiative.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our local anti-cannabis groups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it one group or were there multiple
groups involved in this bullshit?
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be a second group now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could just be the first group using a
new name.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well then let's not name either one of
their groups.
[SPEAKER_10]: One or more.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that way they don't get any more
support.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people want to go troll them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to mention them so that maybe
perhaps people, and I couldn't ask our
[SPEAKER_10]: listeners to go and troll these people and
say crazy shit on their page, but if they
[SPEAKER_10]: did, I couldn't stop them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or better yet, just go correct their
nonsense politely and watch them stew and
[SPEAKER_07]: freak out on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it makes them look even worse.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they can't figure out what to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have any research at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we'll just give them an easy
way to find them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to your page.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just come to my page.
[SPEAKER_10]: So go check out Mike's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Was.
[SPEAKER_10]: I clicked like, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to follow the updates of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike is a very, I don't know the word,
but he knows what the fuck is going on in
[SPEAKER_10]: the cannabis world and our local and our
state nationwide, worldwide.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike stays on top of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when I need some updates on
cannabis, I go to Mike all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's my politics and cannabis update guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot going on right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm insanely busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep that mind busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's talk about this local group here
is trying to close all of the recreational
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they doing just record?
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to do medical?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they want it all gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you head over to their page at all
and look through their post history,
[SPEAKER_07]: medical is a sham.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all a joke and a scam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a con to make money on the backs of
our children.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they want it all gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now they're just focused on
getting rid of the rec industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So recreational stores, production
facilities, manufacturers, grows,
[SPEAKER_07]: testing labs, all of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want it gone.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only reason I could find on
their Facebook page because drugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one article that kind of got into a
little bit of their reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are more homeless people in the city
than there were before.
[SPEAKER_07]: They seem to think the crime problem in
the city is new and somehow cannabis shops
[SPEAKER_07]: in the county related.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they there's another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tax that the tax proceeds that come in
are really, really, really, well reported.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they they're pretty sure that if they
get rid of the taxes, then no one in
[SPEAKER_07]: government will have a reason to continue
to support the marijuana industry and
[SPEAKER_07]: they'll be able to get rid of the rest of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of their issues are with home
grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're not going to get rid of any
home grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they get rid of the stores,
they're going to produce significantly
[SPEAKER_07]: more of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll, cater to the black market all
over again.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Gary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we should talk about home grows
because there's been a big push on home
[SPEAKER_08]: grows lately.
Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Multiple raids in Denver, down here,
Park County, Montrose, 17 raids since
[SPEAKER_08]: March 1st that I'm aware of in the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have major, major growths.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bigger, if you're trying to do major
production out of your house and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: not an incredibly well-known medical
patient and caregiver that's registered
[SPEAKER_07]: and active in their local politics and
stuff, I'd have your paperwork in order.
[SPEAKER_10]: And have your plant count in order.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check your local and county ordinances
because a lot of the cities and counties
[SPEAKER_10]: are passing limiting plant counts while
you're asleep.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing it in private sessions while
you're asleep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very quietly.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're waking up to a new plant count and
they're just out in your backyard cutting
[SPEAKER_10]: down your plants because you're out of
compliance overnight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of it around Colorado is complaint
driven.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a couple of well-publicized
busts down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them was because the neighbor
complained about some shit that most
[SPEAKER_07]: neighbors would have complained about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other one, they got busted in
Florida with a car full of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Texas or wherever.
[SPEAKER_07]: They snitched.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they got tracked back here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they snitched.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuckers.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the interesting part about both of
those is that it was people from far away
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to grow weed here and take it
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and also they were like,
the biggest bust was five grow houses in
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody involved, 12 people,
had all been in Colorado less than 60
[SPEAKER_08]: days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're people that- That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't know any part of the rules
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they think they can do whatever they
want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they don't even know what to hide.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not even well-informed enough to
know to hide.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just really sloppy and stupid.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it makes the rest of us look bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my point there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is an effort right now from the
regulatory bodies, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're seeing it, like Mike was
pointing out earlier, the regulations
[SPEAKER_08]: change abruptly, frequently.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to really stay on top.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's almost like they're attempting to
trip people, license holders up so that
[SPEAKER_08]: they can find them or pull their license
now that they have their funds.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Those massive licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't really say that, but it is- A lot
of the rules aren't passed with how
[SPEAKER_07]: they'll be implemented in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: At all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when they're writing the law,
they pick an hour, okay, it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: pass today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give them six months from today to
get any compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes they're talking about like
major construction issues.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys dealing with the new
packaging rules at the spot?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, everybody is.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so stupid, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: So- Sorry to go MED talk on you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some ridiculous shit that just recently
happened in the MED tracking system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you buy loose flour,
I've got to give you a small pamphlet full
[SPEAKER_07]: of information, basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many printed labels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that also?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much fine print.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the packaging, how everything's a
separate package and a batch number at the
[SPEAKER_07]: end of the day?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tracking is nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you think you can move here from
another state, grow weed here easily,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then ship it back, you're fucking
nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're looking for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: A, they're looking for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And B,
[SPEAKER_07]: your local paper hasn't reported on the
hundreds of hours in city council meetings
[SPEAKER_07]: that people have spent arguing zoning
rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't seen the hundreds of news
articles about them every day in your
[SPEAKER_07]: local paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just get the major news bulletins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the rest of us know, okay,
you can't have 600 plants in your
[SPEAKER_07]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy's probably breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's going to call the cops on him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go over there for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I understand that this movement to
make Puebla West a city is related somehow
[SPEAKER_08]: to the anti-cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: That if they can get incorporated as a
city, they can get rid of it too.
[SPEAKER_08]: They then put you under municipal rule.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not under the county rule anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's their plan B, is from what
I understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many people, if the cannabis business
were shut down, if I said right now,
[SPEAKER_10]: no more cannabis business in Puebla West,
no more recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: how many jobs would be lost?
[SPEAKER_07]: Immediately, it would be somewhere between
700 and a thousand people.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's badged employees working at stores,
grows, production facilities, edible
[SPEAKER_07]: companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's going to be lawyers,
accountants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's everybody else.
[SPEAKER_07]: The accountants, the lawyers, the
packaging companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: The security companies, the contractors.
[SPEAKER_07]: The grow store is going to start losing
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they might do better because more
home grows are going to spring up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's obvious.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to take a lot of hard grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, yeah, the volume that
those places do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to throw a lot of stuff in
disarray.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be good for anybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes more than two vehicles to load up
our soil order when we go buy soil at the
[SPEAKER_07]: shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Pueblo can't take a hit like that
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a thousand people to be able to work
overnight, Pueblo simply can't handle
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: The demographic that is employed in most
of these facilities are 25 to 35 to 40
[SPEAKER_10]: year old folks right now, and there's no
job market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lower income.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're used to living off those
budtender tips and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going back to the bank,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: If they lose this job.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, we had somebody trying to do
that recently.
[SPEAKER_10]: A friend of ours who lost his job decided
to not be involved in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: He tried to go get a job at a bank and he
has to try to figure out how to make that
[SPEAKER_10]: adjustment, make it look good on a resume
and such.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hit that Pueblo would take just with
those jobs is bad, but when you consider
[SPEAKER_07]: that secondary supporting ring,
I mean, there's a hundred other industries
[SPEAKER_07]: that you need to run a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the taxpayers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the article on my computer
screen, but I should mention the part
[SPEAKER_10]: about the scholarships.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's five million dollars out of the
county budget next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that like that's what they're projected
to make this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if in November elections, if this
passes next year, we might collect three
[SPEAKER_07]: and a half million before October when
this rule would kick in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's five million dollars for
the stuff in the county budget we've
[SPEAKER_07]: slated to do with this money, like one
point three million of it's going to the
[SPEAKER_07]: state fair to fix up the egg building.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another seven hundred thousand
going for college scholarships here in
[SPEAKER_07]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: So local high school kids that are getting
ready to graduate right now, if they want
[SPEAKER_07]: to go to one of the two colleges down here
in Pueblo, they can apply for a marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: scholarship and all of that money is
coming from marijuana taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're sending kids to college with this
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag marijuana scholarship.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I've got to say about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some middle school out in Pueblo
West where it's just like the road,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's no sidewalk or gutter or anything
that the kids walk on from their
[SPEAKER_07]: neighborhood to the school every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like crazy unsafe because the
buses that kids from a little further out
[SPEAKER_07]: are riding on are traveling on the street,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're putting sidewalks in there with
this money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we're doing shit that should have
been done forever ago that we couldn't
[SPEAKER_07]: afford to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to stop five million
dollars worth of that just overnight,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe after this November's election.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy to think about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of people fired up in
Pueblo right now over this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be ridiculous to put that many
tax dollars in the in the toilet and flush
[SPEAKER_10]: it down and put that many people out of
employment.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be stupid, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for something that's not causing any
problems, particularly when you think
[SPEAKER_08]: about, you know, marijuana was here before
it was legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be here after it's,
you know, even if they pass this,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just all the benefits are going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problems are going to compound.
[SPEAKER_10]: The growers that lose their jobs at the
dispensaries are going to go grow the
[SPEAKER_10]: black market, grow the shit out of it,
not pay taxes on it, have people come in
[SPEAKER_10]: and go into their residence, create more
traffic in your residence, have an illegal
[SPEAKER_10]: grow next door to your house, have people
come in to buy herb next door to your
[SPEAKER_10]: house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what Kamiya is really bizarre
about this effort to shut down the rec
[SPEAKER_07]: industry is that's where the benefits come
from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're almost problem free.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the entire run that Pueblo has done
with marijuana shops, period, all one
[SPEAKER_07]: license was rescinded kind of
automatically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then another license was the first
dispensary in Colorado, period,
[SPEAKER_07]: to get shut down for regulatory
infractions, not law violations or major
[SPEAKER_07]: rule breaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just the regulations change.
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't meet them fast enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's been it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we don't cause crime.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have stuff going out the back
door to some other place or state.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have teenagers shopping there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everybody down here in the legal
industry follows the rules because we all
[SPEAKER_07]: want to be open next month.
[SPEAKER_07]: And any small violation of the rules can
cost you your license.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you don't see big dispensaries
screwing up in any major ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because it's too expensive to risk
screwing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you end up hiring three or four
people to just run around all day and make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure everybody's compliant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking with the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the problems these people have
with legal marijuana have to do with every
[SPEAKER_07]: other part of marijuana being legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Home grows, where people can consume,
how people can consume the variety of
[SPEAKER_07]: edible products, access to teenagers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like none of that shit changes if you get
rid of rec.
[SPEAKER_07]: It all gets worse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every bit of it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the county shops are doing like 1.7
to 2.5 million in sales every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: You figure half that's tourists.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've still got a million and a half
going back into the ghetto.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you don't want all of that business
taking place in the house at the street
[SPEAKER_07]: because those are the ones that bad people
with shotgun show up and try to rob.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hotels are going to lose money.
[SPEAKER_10]: Restaurants are going to lose money.
[SPEAKER_10]: The movie theater will lose money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, that's the other half of that
money is all the people coming here for
[SPEAKER_07]: vacations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we were a spring break destination.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one I know that grew up here has ever
had like a bunch of people in town for
[SPEAKER_07]: spring break.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people came to town for spring
break this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really odd.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the thing is if they would turn a
little different and promote that and
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivate that, then that could be huge
next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: A massive amount of tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Massive amounts.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do they make a year out there in
Pueblo West in cannabis taxes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year it was like 1.7 million.
[SPEAKER_07]: This next year it's going to be five,
mainly because there's a new 3.5% tax on
[SPEAKER_07]: the production.
[SPEAKER_07]: So an excise tax.
[SPEAKER_08]: Five million dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and they put in massive growth
facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a huge expansion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we didn't have a special excise
tax, just a special sales tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know by any random chance what
Pueblo West's other tax income is?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what do they bring in other than?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they bring in a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the number?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know their number minus cannabis
taxes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, the marijuana taxes represent
like 2% at most of the county or the state
budget.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't make it sound so appealing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is significantly more than alcohol
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Already.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you put it as an overall percentage,
it seems small.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you look at the list of stuff
that, like we can't pay cops right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there isn't an extra 1% in the
budget.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you got five million extra,
you can maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not so much extra at this point
because right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the darkest city I've ever driven
through.
[SPEAKER_07]: They budgeted for it because it's going to
come in this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so funding got moved around and when
the five million for marijuana,
[SPEAKER_07]: like if that doesn't come in because of
this vote, all kinds of stuff isn't going
[SPEAKER_07]: to happen the year after that because of
those cuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll start to look like Detroit in a few
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you really can't, Pueblo definitely
can't afford to lose that kind of jobs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you see major articles in the
chieftain when the steel mill lays off 200
[SPEAKER_07]: people temporarily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the impact that the city feels
when that happens is major.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 200 paychecks.
[SPEAKER_07]: If a thousand people, say it's only 700.
[SPEAKER_07]: If 700 people stop bringing home paychecks
because of this vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's 700 fewer people that can
order dinner, have pizza delivered,
[SPEAKER_07]: go to the movies, go get another pair of
sneakers, go get their kids' school
[SPEAKER_07]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 700 people that are going to be
applying for food stamps.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 700 people that are going to be going
to food, unemployment, food pantries.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 700 more stresses on an already
overtaxed system of support in this
[SPEAKER_08]: community.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a small community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pointless.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pointless.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's literally like 1% of the people in
Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's 130 some thousand people down
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like the worst type of
self-sabotage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We really can't take a hit like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, the reason I wanted to
have this podcast, the reason I wanted to
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about this issue is I want everybody
who supports cannabis to take it
[SPEAKER_08]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because from my perspective on social
media and out in the community,
[SPEAKER_08]: nobody's really taking it seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what that frightens me to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think anybody took the idea that
they could shut down cannabis in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_10]: West seriously.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't seem like something feasible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, oh, they can't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We voted it in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Voted it in is what a lot of people say.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just dismiss it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody shows up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can vote it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can vote it right out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like we voted it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's a weird election to run this
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the anti-pop people tend to be more
conservative.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just had a democratic president for
eight years.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no stretch in American history.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had a two-term president from one
party or another, followed by a president
[SPEAKER_07]: from that same party.
[SPEAKER_07]: So history tells us that more
conservatives are going to turn out in
[SPEAKER_07]: this election than liberals to vote for
president, which means they're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: at the polls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means that if the youth vote and the
pro-cannabis vote don't come out in force
[SPEAKER_07]: this November, it's done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here locally, we could see the rec
industry shut down and a lot of us would
[SPEAKER_07]: be out of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would really suck.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's four or five states that at
least that are legalizing that whole big
[SPEAKER_07]: list we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not all of those efforts are going to make
the ballot, but five to eight to 10 of
[SPEAKER_07]: them are going to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if people don't show up and vote in
those areas, those efforts are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: lose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of the people that say,
or have been saying legalization is
[SPEAKER_07]: inevitable are going to watch that tide
turn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the pendulum is going to swing back
the other way, just like it typically does
[SPEAKER_07]: in politics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to see states that have
liberalized their marijuana lives start to
[SPEAKER_07]: go the other way again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't want to see that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everybody needs to figure out if you're
registered to vote, figure out how to vote
[SPEAKER_07]: in your area, where to vote in your area,
and get on top of that and stay on top of
[SPEAKER_07]: that all the way through the election in
November.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just Pueblo West, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important to me locally because I
could get fired in November and that would
[SPEAKER_07]: really suck.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a beautiful little boy that he's
got to take care of.
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep Mike employed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a nice little life going right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's thanks in large part to the
recreational industry in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to the medical industry in
Colorado Springs.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, all of us are basically working in
legal cannabis in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if rec goes this year, I see a lot of
the medical people like, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, my shop will be doing better if
rec goes away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For two years at most before this is an
election again, when even fewer liberals
[SPEAKER_07]: turn out and because they managed to kill
rec in Pueblo where it was so big last
[SPEAKER_07]: year, you're just going to be an easier
target.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can't get unified on this,
it could get real ugly come November.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really like my job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, you should run for some
sort of office, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you be mayor?
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have a mayor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but I mean, you can be it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor really has no power though.
[SPEAKER_08]: He needs to run for city council.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's at large.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys tweet Mike and encourage Mike to
run for city council in the city of
[SPEAKER_10]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Limit at large.
[SPEAKER_10]: Limit at large.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Limit at large.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys tweet him.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: At Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just hashtag Limit at large.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's already a hashtag,
but, and then let him know that you're
[SPEAKER_10]: following him through the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Follow my buddy, Mike.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: He knows a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gary, do you have any social, I'm not
wrapping up the show, but since I'm shy
[SPEAKER_10]: now, Mike, I feel like it's completely
fair to give you a social media shout out
[SPEAKER_10]: if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, I've been recovering from a
serious accident.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to see you back on your feet and
doing well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, this is kind of one of my
first forays out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides doctor's appointments and,
you know, necessary training.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got like a, is that like a,
what I can see is probably a good four
[SPEAKER_10]: inch gash on your forehead.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes all the way in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had 47 stitches and 39 staples in my
head.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've also got a cracked cervical
vertebrae and a torn rotator cuff that
[SPEAKER_08]: haven't even been addressed yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the accident was in December.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's been a long recovery.
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize it was that bad through
your Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you looked like a soldier on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, I got in a wreck.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a cool scar.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, damn, I got fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm glad you're all right,
brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're glad you're all right, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to your son.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's doing awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Straight A student.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very proud of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a bright kid.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like hanging out with him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great kid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You forget that he's a kid sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's uh, no offense, but people don't
want to hear about our kids.
[SPEAKER_10]: They might.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should mention.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to all the kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Raise them right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they're not listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I was going to reroute this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Mike's got to go cough up a dab.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to find a classier way to say
that, but I don't want to break for a
[SPEAKER_10]: second.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a quick break and
then, uh, we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, I need a dab anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we just got all high, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Gary decided that somebody needs to
create an animated series based on my
[SPEAKER_10]: likeness.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is a copy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right on my likeness.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you guys can't fuck with this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually do have a trademark on my
likeness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to tell you the name of the
company and everything, but that is
[SPEAKER_10]: patented.
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't try to fuck with my likeness or
my name, but he just told me that I need
[SPEAKER_10]: to have a cartoon of myself and I would
have the lion of Judah as my sidekick.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'd be Rasta Jeff and the lion Judah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd be walking around solving
cannabis related mysteries and or crimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be awesome, but it wouldn't be
like cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be like, you know, crimes against
cannabis, I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you spraying that shit on your
plants while you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, you can't do that to the plants when
they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not going to let them do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they give me some shitty Jamaican
accent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you want it to be me doing my own
voice?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or would they hire like a voiceover?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do your own voice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Way more watchable if it's you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your regular voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, we get a great,
you know, sidekick character for the lion.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to audition to be the lion,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you want to produce a fucking Rasta
Jeff themed cartoon, I am down as shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see this happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Garrett Waller.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd be a perfect due to the lion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Garrett Waller's funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd be a perfect lion, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got to see if we got chemistry.
[SPEAKER_10]: He kind of looks like a lion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a question of how many dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's episode number one?
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we doing in episode number one?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's our mystery?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're kind of, I'm seeing it, I'm
envisioning us like as the ganja,
[SPEAKER_10]: more obviously ganja-fied Scooby-Doo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rasta Jeff, some motherfucker sold me some
bunk ass weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking more like our plants got
stolen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Help us find out who took them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you track it back like up the
road or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could even go like fully educational
and do like each episode is like a grow
[SPEAKER_08]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like, look, you've got, you've got
might.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rasta, Judith, do cloning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do it that way or you do it
funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the mystery solving thing,
but you could go education.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was much more Scooby-Doo than it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's got an education of Rosenthal,
but I think it could be both.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely could.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should go watch the Mike Tyson
mysteries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen them?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm baking when I see this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just replacing you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's great, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anybody wants to kind of replace the
Mike Tyson mysteries with me and my lion,
[SPEAKER_10]: Judah, I'm game.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say, I want to see me and I
would like to see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fighting crime.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I be a superhero?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we give me, do I have a superpower?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just, I think you can have powers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can talk to plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing about cartoons is you can
have powers, you know, because they don't
[SPEAKER_08]: have to be Judah can certainly have
powers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that version better where you can
be super high and the lion can be a
[SPEAKER_07]: superhero.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to be tally.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing is it's easy to be tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there'd be like a whole question
of whether the lion is real or not.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of Wilfred like now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just about to say, don't go
Wilfred.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, not that far, but you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's your sidekick, but you know,
suddenly he's only there when I'm blazed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's we don't ever show me smoking or
talk about me smoking, but only when I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: obviously high, Judah shows up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody asked me a question that I don't
know the answer to him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me go find Judah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I come back with Judah and I've
got the answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But those elements like the 70 show
element, the Mike Tyson mysteries element,
[SPEAKER_08]: and the Scooby-Doo elements.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could work those in, we'll make it
even funnier because these are hashtags.
[SPEAKER_07]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just what fucking dab dab
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not editing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is podcasting at its finest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the table.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, this is what three dudes that
have had too many dabs sit around and talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can probably go for one more,
but I don't want to blow out the throat
[SPEAKER_10]: and try to record, but once you guys get
talking, I might take a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: So recently the DEA has announced that
they are going to investigate cannabis a
[SPEAKER_10]: little further.
[SPEAKER_10]: And within 90 days, they will release
their opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rather they decide to reschedule cannabis
as a schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an article on the fingers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm no good with the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the numbers mixed up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to reschedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now it is currently listed as a
schedule one drug, meaning that for the
[SPEAKER_10]: purposes of federal law, the drug has no
medical value and a high potential for
[SPEAKER_10]: abuse and is one of the most dangerous
drugs of all drug schedules with
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially severe psychological or
physical dependence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That right there poses a really big
problem for the government.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a different branch of the
government owns a patent for medical uses
[SPEAKER_08]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how can it have no medical uses and you
own the patent?
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been comfortable with that bit of
hypocrisy for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a case working its way through
the courts that is challenging that very
[SPEAKER_07]: issue that one of them has basically been
waiting for a decade to see this coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this move is ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my initial thought on this move was
this is an establishment Democrat move to
[SPEAKER_08]: take some wins.
[SPEAKER_08]: And out of Bernie Sanders, if they
reschedule before the election,
[SPEAKER_08]: that kind of removes a key issue for
Sanders.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason we highlighted Sanders on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: As an establishment Democrat move,
it's kind of brilliant.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I was just expecting the DEA to swap
this down like they have every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we've gotten to this point in the
DEA trying to reschedule it before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I haven't kept up as much as
I should have with this current
[SPEAKER_07]: incarnation of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would be surprised if that,
but it could be, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you think they're giving up the queen
to save the king?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, look, socially the tide has turned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: With the number of states that have
legalized all of the things that are
[SPEAKER_10]: changing, it is definitely obvious.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen the DNC, the Democratic
establishment do all kinds of shit to
[SPEAKER_08]: Sanders.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of fits the profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not trying to be a conspiracy
theorist.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just see a massive political value for
Hillary Clinton if it happens before the
[SPEAKER_08]: election.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a huge political value for her if
it happens before the election.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether it's intentional or
unintentional.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I agree with Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that under normal circumstances,
this is just the DEA is going to shuffle
[SPEAKER_08]: some papers around and fuck you.
[SPEAKER_08]: This bullshit is going to fuck you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've literally been taken to federal
court and lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still not done.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're their own DEA law judge.
[SPEAKER_07]: When the original federal medical program
was created, two citizens sued the feds.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, and then the DEA law judge that
overheard the case recommended that the
[SPEAKER_07]: DEA reschedule marijuana in their response
was to basically shame them into
[SPEAKER_07]: retirement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but what you have to understand and
what we all have to acknowledge here is
[SPEAKER_08]: that they are fully under the control of
the executive branch.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the president ordered them to do that,
or they wouldn't have done it,
[SPEAKER_08]: period.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the president ordered them not to
do it, they wouldn't have done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than likely.
[SPEAKER_08]: More than likely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all probabilities, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the difference right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the implications are really weird,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have several options.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could do nothing, and very possibly
they could do nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically what I expected to see
happen was this to come up again and then
[SPEAKER_07]: to say, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be the answer, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that tends to be the federal response
when it comes to marijuana is they just
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of shake their head and say no,
and things go on the way they have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Under normal circumstances.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we would all expect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would they have even bothered to announce
it if they weren't going to do something?
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't have to tell us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the pressure- The story that I did
glance at, I don't think they announced it
[SPEAKER_07]: quite as intentional.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't mean for this to happen
because a number of different news
[SPEAKER_07]: agencies are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody had forwarded the wrong email to
the wrong person.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to be looking at this
between now and what is it, August?
[SPEAKER_07]: Memo was leaked to, I want to say it was
Matt Fornier, but I'm not positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, I'm not sure that this was
intended to be as publicized as it has
[SPEAKER_07]: been, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: The shit gets leaked on purpose too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks to whoever leaked it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good material.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could have leaked it to kind of test
public sentiment on it to see how it's
[SPEAKER_08]: going to fly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a comedian tweets a joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just tweeted their joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they do nothing, then we're where we
are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing changes, except that whoever the
next president is then has the authority
[SPEAKER_08]: to come and shut all this shit down if
they want to under federal law.
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't kid yourself, Trump will do
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: His whole campaign sparks of that,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: His whole campaign is insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't surprise me that you're
having Trump nightmares.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well put, actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the DEA could possibly come out and
say, hey, this does have medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could kind of- Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So option one, do nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's probably what the consensus,
what everybody expects, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But option two is they reschedule.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means it goes somewhere between two
and five on the schedule, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: List.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that puts it under the jurisdiction of
the FDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now- If it's scheduled anywhere below
one, it's under FDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even if it drops to two,
a lot of good things happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of good things happen, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of strange things happen because,
I mean, we've spent an amazingly long time
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to figure out how to make it too
punitive for people to risk smoking or
[SPEAKER_07]: having weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of those rules are still in place,
even in places like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: So rescheduling it anywhere on the
schedule still leaves some really
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really, really does.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like I said, putting it anywhere on
the schedule makes it under the authority
[SPEAKER_08]: of the FDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that leaves a whole bunch of questions
of how would that work?
[SPEAKER_08]: How would that even begin to work because
it's not a typical pharmaceutical?
[SPEAKER_10]: What I predicted may- I don't know if I've
said this on an episode before,
[SPEAKER_10]: what I predict, unfortunately,
maybe if we do go to a national- I thought
[SPEAKER_10]: it would be medical first, but it looks
like we may have a national recreational
[SPEAKER_10]: program.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've already done that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll find somebody- Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to find somebody to grow it
and then it's not going to be something
[SPEAKER_10]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a mass produced product
that is going to be, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: wipe out all the small grows like what
we've got going now.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, it's just not happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not happening that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a top down kind of affectation of
political change, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happening from the bottom up on the
state level.
[SPEAKER_08]: A third option they have rather than
rescheduling, they could delist it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could deschedule completely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they could even go so far as to
recommend that although it's delisted and
[SPEAKER_08]: not a rescheduled drug, that it needs
special care.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the ATF could become the ATFC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, literally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they'd use marijuana instead of
cannabis in their acronym.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they wouldn't, but that's totally
on the list of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and some of the analysis that I
read, the policy analysis, that if you
[SPEAKER_08]: look at the recent history of structuring
government, this would probably be the way
[SPEAKER_08]: they would do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of integration with homeland
security, ATF has already fully
[SPEAKER_08]: integrated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in this transition period where
we're going from illegal to legal,
[SPEAKER_08]: the ATF would be able to monitor the legal
grows and keep out cartels and stuff like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then their role would diminish as it
has with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ATF was heavy in regulation when
alcohol first became legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they've eased off on alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, it's just regulated like
anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: The state regulatory agency has
inspectors.
[SPEAKER_07]: The inspectors come by and check stuff
with something like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a retail distributed intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_07]: There'd be the occasional ID sting,
but it's really not that complicated to
[SPEAKER_07]: turn it into a product just like anything
else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what descheduling it and
putting it under the ATF jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_08]: would do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would solve the government's
problem of worrying about cartels getting
[SPEAKER_08]: in and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because then they could go to every state
and inspect them.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And without even having to put any
regulations on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just looking for money laundering and tax
evasion and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they do with the ATF does with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: They only do the top level alcohol stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think anybody else has thought this
idea?
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't just make this shit up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went out and read smarter people than
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is what they think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the odds of them descheduling
cannabis in the next couple of months is
[SPEAKER_07]: around like one or two or 3% at most.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the DAA does anything, it will likely
be lower the schedule a point or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: So down to schedule two or three,
which we can debate for a really long time
[SPEAKER_07]: if it belongs on the schedule.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really don't think the DAA is going
to do anything because that's historically
[SPEAKER_07]: what they've always done is just nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The marijuana is too big a piece of the
drug war pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where 80% of all drug consumers,
all illicit drug consumers only consume
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You take cannabis out of that equation and
they've got a real hard time justifying a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of their budgets.
True.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why they spend so many times
flying around or so much time flying
[SPEAKER_07]: around shopping down cannabis plants in
the woods.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because if they don't, they don't get
paid.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they do federally regulate it to
another schedule, is Mike going to have to
[SPEAKER_10]: become a pharmacist basically now to be a
budtender?
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I going to have to wear a lab coat and
go a little bit more extreme and get
[SPEAKER_10]: major, some sort of pharmaceutical
accreditation?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be the word I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wouldn't change state laws,
but it would give the FDA an opportunity
[SPEAKER_08]: to basically do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can put any type.
[SPEAKER_07]: Depending on where it falls on the
schedule, budtending would still be a
[SPEAKER_07]: federal offense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Depending, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even if it moved to just schedule two,
the ability for doctors to research it
[SPEAKER_07]: would increase greatly.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the main hurdles right now is like
if you get your whole study approved,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's only one small place where you can
get the cannabis from.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you watch Sanjay Gupta's marijuana
specials, you can check out where that
[SPEAKER_07]: place is and what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the supply is still drastically
limited and with the number of different
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds in the cannabis plant,
the number of different medical
[SPEAKER_07]: applications that people in our industry
have seen hinted at, but would like
[SPEAKER_07]: further research on, all of those studies
get a lot easier to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if it only moves to two, it opens up
everything basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as research goes, yeah,
that door really opens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would we be able to study cannabis at the
University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_10]: or Colorado State University Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't think the DEA is going to
move on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the federal government moves,
in my opinion, it will because an acting
[SPEAKER_07]: president rallies Congress just like they
do on countless other issues using the
[SPEAKER_07]: bully pulpit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be a long drawn out process is my
opinion, but who knows the DEA could jump
[SPEAKER_07]: for all kinds of reasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the analysis that I read,
and this was a policy analysis from Q
[SPEAKER_08]: Research, their take on it is right now,
nobody knows what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this election cycle, basically
everybody's pulling out all the stops.
[SPEAKER_07]: All bets are off.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The benefit here in this situation for
Clinton could be the tipping point,
[SPEAKER_08]: could be the thing that does it after all
these fucking years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, he gave about five examples of
that's how shit works in this country.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's enough support out there that it
could get done without too much turmoil
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could fly.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obama's a lame duck.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_10]: True.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's on his way out.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Door's about to close on his ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've never said a nice word about him
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't give a fuck what the opponents
think.
[SPEAKER_08]: True.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were talking about two election vote
situations where about 100 people voiced
[SPEAKER_10]: their concern on one way and two or three
people stood up and voiced their concern
[SPEAKER_10]: on the opposition.
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, the council members went
with the lower votes in both cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in Colorado Springs recently on two
very different issues.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very different issues, but it went the
same damn way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're seeing here in southern
Colorado, we're seeing a culture war
[SPEAKER_08]: really starting to bubble up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing this movement, this whatever
it is movement against marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing the city council in Colorado
Springs taking all kinds of actions that
[SPEAKER_08]: are just really opposed to public outcry.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of those is on marijuana, but there
were other issues like completely
[SPEAKER_08]: unrelated to marijuana where the public
was really vocal on it and they still move
[SPEAKER_08]: directly against it right away and with
the other way.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting thick around here,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting thick nationally too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Politics goes in cycles.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, pull out a history book or just if
you're older, think back.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes liberal, conservative,
liberal, conservative, and it has for the
[SPEAKER_07]: last 100 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pushfall and Reagan.
[SPEAKER_07]: True, but it's getting more and more
conservative right now because it got more
[SPEAKER_07]: and more liberal for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made some nice progress and some nice
issues, but at the same time, the
[SPEAKER_07]: conservative folks, the anti-pot groups,
they've been getting clobbered in election
[SPEAKER_07]: after election and council meeting after
council meeting and licenseeering after
[SPEAKER_07]: licenseeering and they're pissed.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Motivated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Down here, they're going with the nuclear
option and it seems like they are
[SPEAKER_07]: nationally too given Trump's popularity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if more people don't get active,
that takes paying attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes some dedication.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes reading the news.
[SPEAKER_07]: Occasionally, it takes staying informed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something that you can just do
overnight, but if more people our age and
[SPEAKER_07]: more people that aren't into cannabis
don't start getting involved, it can get
[SPEAKER_07]: real ugly for the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Eight years at least.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Register and vote.
[SPEAKER_10]: Register and vote.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say the ball is in your
hands, but that just sounds gross.
[SPEAKER_08]: Vote your conscience on the presidential
candidate, but support the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone at this table relies heavily on
the cannabis industry, the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something I want to add.
[SPEAKER_10]: I come from the black market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I come from the dark side of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there weren't a legal cannabis market,
you know where I would be?
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd probably still be part of the black
market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be crushing the black market,
just like I used to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a legitimate job.
[SPEAKER_10]: I pay a lot of damn taxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a time clock now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing everything legit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got manifests and invoices for every
grandma product I produce now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched it happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent a lot of time kind of in the gray
world working for caregivers and one by
[SPEAKER_07]: one, the dried up because it was too much
of a hassle now.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not enough profit in Colorado
because most of that's going to the legal
[SPEAKER_07]: market now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike and I got to watch the whole thing
shift.
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't take long either.
[SPEAKER_10]: To the street, to the caregiver model,
to the kind of a dispensary, to the
[SPEAKER_10]: sketchy-ass dispensary, to the,
okay, that's a dispensary, to holy shit,
[SPEAKER_10]: this is regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really nice shit we have now.
[SPEAKER_10]: To the clubs, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to all the people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is mainly all of the Mikes out
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike is part of a team.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm part of a team.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get all the glory because I've got a
show with my face on the fucking label.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a seed company that I hype a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got the Instagram that everybody
checks out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the voice, I'm the face, but there
are, for every one of me, there are three
[SPEAKER_10]: or four people supporting what I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just me that's able to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to give Mike a fist bump
because he's the closest one to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that fist bump is for all the people
that make this shit possible because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: not just a one-man effort.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get all the Facebook and Instagram love,
but it's all you guys also.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're a huge community.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys don't get enough support.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike's been there since the beginning with
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since fucking Mike helped me transplant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Clones back in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in the way day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember when your grill room was
like 110 degrees?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's not even go here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not even go here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when it was three foot by three
foot, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when you could bake potatoes on
the floor, that bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: We probably tried.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the learning days.
[SPEAKER_07]: The learning days were fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of years of experience, a lot of
battles that were fought, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: years before the show started going to
making it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And giving you guys, I mean, decades worth
of lessons.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're still listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to fail.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to fail a thousand times to learn
the hundred things that I learned.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to fail so many times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to sit through hundreds of hours of
council meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hundreds of hours of council meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just watching the process happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Watching how things normally happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: A whole lot of conviction on cultivation
of a large farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: One supported that and learned a lot.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just going through and watching it
took up, I mean, hundreds of hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just so that now that all of this is
going down, we can be active in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it takes work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come from the dark side, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come into the legal regulated market,
pay some taxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bro, now I was able to go to a car
dealership and they're like, so what do
[SPEAKER_10]: you do for work?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I have a pay stub and I work
at a legitimate place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, oh, we'll give you a fat
credit instead of like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to pay cash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I just buy a car and looking sketchy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it felt way better.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just walk in there and be like,
look, I have like a real line of work.
[SPEAKER_10]: It felt really nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just come from the dark side,
join the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get legit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hide.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't have to look over your shoulder all
the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be a eyesore on the movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I see people, there'll be a
legalization effort running in their area
[SPEAKER_07]: and they'll be fighting it because it's
not enough in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at Colorado's rules and
how it all hashed out, like it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: enough in our eyes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get clubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're missing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clubs are a big issue, but they're not
even close to the only issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not enough yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the reality of the situation is it's
the best situation scenario anyone's got
[SPEAKER_07]: on the planet by miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a couple of states coming up
behind us that might end up in similar
[SPEAKER_07]: positions cannabis wise, but is it
consumer?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is a patient as a member of the community?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I can't see it getting much better
than this right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that can really improve for
us is pricing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that comes in time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We watched that happen with the medical
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_07]: As more states legalize, as the tourism
industry dips down a little bit,
[SPEAKER_07]: as more shops open, as competition gets
better, people become more talented.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of brother-in-laws that got
hired to grow a lot of warehouse weed and
[SPEAKER_07]: it didn't come out so hot for some of
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, growers still tend to be a
problem for dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to predict a cannabis shortage this
summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: The state estimates we're a ton or more
under consumption for our production right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not even close to meeting demand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I bust out a humble brag?
[SPEAKER_10]: I run an 80, we have 85.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I heard these numbers.
[SPEAKER_10]: 85 lights in the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I pulled 200 and I think 217 ish
pounds is what I think I remember reading.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: 217 and a half pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw your boss post it on social media.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the exact number because
I remember thinking 237, but that might
[SPEAKER_07]: just be a number I made up my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds close.
[SPEAKER_10]: So somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had, I could go look, but I'm,
it's, I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that number has gone to my head,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Between 215 and 230 something pounds of
usable cannabis underneath 85 lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: We pulled about 2.2 pounds per light is
what I think we math that out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe 2.5 or something like that is what I
did the math on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I'll do what I can to produce
those tonnages of cannabis that we need
[SPEAKER_10]: for the summer you guys, but I can't
promise you that it'll all be out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: See everybody got to do their part.
[SPEAKER_10]: Push, push out 200 something pounds from
85 lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be inspiring.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like just look at the table for a second
and then think back to 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: cause that's where they are in Louisiana,
Texas, New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, countless other States.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're where we are 10 or 15 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give them five or six years.
[SPEAKER_10]: About 10, a lot of the dab thing is
catching on.
[SPEAKER_10]: The internet moves us more quickly and
people travel a lot more.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to blame a lot of things on
the traveling of jam bands and the music
[SPEAKER_10]: scene.
[SPEAKER_10]: When widespread goes on tour, they're
going to stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're in Austin this week.
[SPEAKER_10]: People that traveled from Colorado to
Austin are introduced and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_10]: Austin's already got dabs and shit,
but they're introducing more people to
[SPEAKER_07]: shatter right now after the widespread
show right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that's made it out, but like law
wise, what happens if you get caught with
[SPEAKER_07]: it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like in Ohio or a number of those middle
States that nobody thinks about a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Ohio, but there's, there's a
lot of States where having cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_07]: major offense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if you're sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if you have cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if you've got Crohn's
disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll take your kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll take your house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my crew from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, but I got a crew that's from Ohio
that listened.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to all them kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Magoo.
[SPEAKER_10]: What up brother?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when I was in Louisiana a year ago,
I watched somebody get like grabbed and
[SPEAKER_07]: thrown to the ground for smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Handcuffed in front of the back of the
squad car, like in party city.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's no joke a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of places and the laws move slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Louisiana just changed their laws though.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a interesting, they seem to be on
the road to legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very slowly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they, the current regs are up to two
and a half pounds is a misdemeanor in your
[SPEAKER_08]: possession and a transfer of up to an
ounce to another adult is a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got one of the worst three strikes
laws in the country though.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can pretty much walk out of their
jail from what I've seen on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: You pretty much just get up and leave if
you feel like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something you want to play with
in a lot of places and the laws slow to
[SPEAKER_07]: change.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to cough into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, dabs are happening here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rigs going back around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike, you got skipped because you cough a
lot, but I'm going to give you one as we
[SPEAKER_10]: start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll come back this way.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't take it personally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I never do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hashtag we like it when they like it when
we, I forgot what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a crazy show.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got some weird places.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're almost an hour and we're over an
hour and 10 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So does anybody have anything important
they want to wrap up a podcast with?
[SPEAKER_08]: How about everybody make their prediction
for the election?
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be the nominee for this too early
for that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in pre-season.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't make me call the Superbowl.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who do you think will be the nominees?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still too early to call.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they're going to give it to
Trump.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm waiting to see the country flip out
when the guy who gets the most votes
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't get the nomination because dude,
you can't put the crazy person in the room
[SPEAKER_07]: with the button.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way the RNC lets that happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're assholes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're fucking anti-American in my
opinion, but they're not that fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but at the same point they haven't put
forward a contender.
[SPEAKER_08]: A Trump presidency creates so much
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our economy takes a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been stepping to the right,
big step by big step for the last 20
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what happens when you step off
the cliff at the end of the red side.
[SPEAKER_08]: That paired with the systematic defunding
of public education.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually keep my mouth shut on politics.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if Trump is afraid of Megyn Kelly,
how's he going to fucking deal with ISIS?

me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Steal your face right
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down the track.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard as a pencil, but cool inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat on a tin roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dogs in a pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing left to do but smile, smile,
smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a stream, look up on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolling down the track.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna bring it back.
He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same old fat in a cage.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Steal your face right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a stream, look up down the track.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna bring it
[SPEAKER_02]: down the track.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a stream, look up down the track.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a stream, look up down the track.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gone.
He's gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a stream, look up down the track.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you check out Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all the commercials for this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jess, you haven't been here in a while,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: How have you been?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's good for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got some licensing happening,
got some big things going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got our MIP and our... Fuck,
I can't remember the initials for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many initials in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got our wholesale grow with no store
attached and a hash producing license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: BHO hash or like water hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_10]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't own the company.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the choice I would have made,
but... But it's still a good product.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not cutting any corners with it,
I can tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you tried any of the distillate
that's made from CO2?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard about it and I did not know
that was made from CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: This here, this is Spherex.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm about to drop it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got two containers stacked up because
it's hard to get that bottom bit out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just turned this one upside down and
put it on there and it dripped into there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It did it for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's some Spherex.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's made from CO2 oil and then they turn
it, they use a fractal distillation
[SPEAKER_10]: process as far as I understand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know exactly what that is,
but I know the basics and they pull out
[SPEAKER_10]: the goodies and that's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take a dab of it here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't do it right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just too much of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do it after the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave it here so we see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that's made from CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got some serious turps on it?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got some serious turps on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to crack this one open and see
what... So now you're reaching for the
[SPEAKER_10]: clear.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the clear, honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the Spherex better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's clear from California.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Super Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Spherex OG Kush and I liked the
turps on this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I prefer the Spherex.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to my friends in the clear.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are my homies.
[SPEAKER_10]: They listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm honest about the things I smoke and
review.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost overwhelming, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost too turpy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to take little dabs of that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take a big dab of something else and
dip it into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that it's not so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one, the Spherex, I could dab a gram
of it by itself and not cough.
[SPEAKER_10]: My throat doesn't burn.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's super smooth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to the guys at Spherex.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just got some free advertising from
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that happens when you make a good
product.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you make a good product, Rasta Jeff
will give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, let's talk about outdoor growing,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's going good for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got the new, the business running.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to grow some outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully people have access to some
clones or some seeds because now it's time
[SPEAKER_10]: to get those going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be a little behind if you're
grown from seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might be by now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess the first question,
when should we put our plants outdoors in
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado?
[SPEAKER_05]: Second week of May is kind of rule of
thumb.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the earliest I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've put them out, you know, first of June
and they still yielded just as good as the
[SPEAKER_05]: ones that went out the second week of May.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get a little extra attention to
count.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got about a two week window that's
primed to put them out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get them out by the first weekend of June
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't done it by then,
carry them out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Carry them out that weekend, get them
started, get them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know offhand when we're going to
start the flowering season?
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of varies from strain to strain,
but typically it's around the end of July,
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that does change a little
regionally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_10]: The dates when you put stuff outside,
the timeframes are going to be a little
[SPEAKER_10]: bit different, varying from coast to
coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: California, you could put them out today.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would probably be okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have friends on Instagram that they're
already out today.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been out for weeks, honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in Oregon and Northern California.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're spoiled out there though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bastards.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't do it like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do crush it though.
[SPEAKER_10]: We figure out how to fix that.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So get them out there the first week of
June at the latest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get them out there, get them ready.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully you've got some clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got some seeds that are going.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've had them sexed already.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know if they're boys or girls.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get some plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get them too big because they're
going to grow really quickly outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, a lot of people weren't
prepared for the size of plants that they
[SPEAKER_10]: were growing and that shit got way too
big.
[SPEAKER_10]: Their camouflage got away from them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Their fences were way too low.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, shit went crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good thing, but it's also a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your plants are going to get really large
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure they're not root bound either.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you take them outside?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you put them in the ground,
I've noticed through my years of
[SPEAKER_05]: experience, root bound plants,
sometimes they go into shock going
[SPEAKER_05]: outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they go into shock in a way that
they want to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right away?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right away and that's no good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure they're not root bound.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the weather is holding or you have a
greenhouse or something, you can put out
[SPEAKER_05]: earlier than the second week.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second week of May, but also right now
we're around 12 hours light here in the
[SPEAKER_05]: first week of April.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you put plants outside, there is a
chance they can go into bloom and you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to re-vege, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to flower, then they're
going to go back and they're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: re-flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: The hormones are going to be all fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad structure, limbs break off and it's
just no good.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So kind of be, don't let them get root
bound.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that leads me into my next question
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to ask you if we should plant
into the dirt outside or if we should take
[SPEAKER_10]: them outside in pots?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my preferred method being kind of
a crunchy hippie, I like to plant straight
[SPEAKER_05]: in the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's less work, I feel like, and the
plants just are healthier.
[SPEAKER_05]: But doing it in containers is very,
very possible too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year I did plants in 150 gallon smart
pots for the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was really stoked with those.
[SPEAKER_10]: How big were your stocks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Gigantic.
[SPEAKER_05]: The size of your arms?
[SPEAKER_05]: The first and second round of plants that
got put in there got stolen by some
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck thieves and plant rippers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't talked much about it,
but I had a horrible summer last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: I never mentioned it on the show,
but we talked about some people getting
[SPEAKER_10]: ripped off.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were one of those.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck whoever took Jesse's plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't get as big as if the first
ones I put out there would have got left
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stocks probably would have been as big
around as a two liter bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: They ended up about as big around as one
of these 60 ounce or 20 ounce of water
[SPEAKER_05]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was with about four and a half
weeks of veg.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were going to be beasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first ones that got taken,
they were my string government mule.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to tell us about government mule?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you an opportunity to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made by Chimera, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a company that's not really in
existence anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's still around though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just doesn't make seeds anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a deep junk, Tom Hill's deep junk
crossed with a G13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were growing the shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The phenol I have is like periodica.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real short and stocky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this plant that was in the 150 gallon
smart pot last year, within maybe six
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks of being outside, or no,
it didn't make it that long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably about four weeks with being
outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was seriously eight foot tall,
six foot around, six foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just beast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not a strain that really beasts
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it was- That big smart pot was
making it happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that leads me perfectly.
[SPEAKER_10]: You keep helping me out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're segueing into my next questions on
accident here.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to put our plants into the
ground, do we just want to throw them into
[SPEAKER_10]: the dirt that's in the backyard?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do we want to dig a hole and put some
good dirt in there, some good soil that we
[SPEAKER_10]: buy from the store?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do we just want to use the backyard
soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if that's all you have,
you can use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't know.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially here in Southern Colorado,
native soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty dusty and kind of clay-like
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been killed off pretty good,
especially like in residential areas and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't hold water well.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's dusty like that, the nutrients
that are in it, because it's shale based
[SPEAKER_05]: soil, there's a shit ton of nutrients in
it, but it's not accessible to the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: because of the structure of the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're growing, you basically end up
growing in a pretty- Super salty
[SPEAKER_10]: environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the very minimum to have pretty good
results, I'd recommend cutting your native
[SPEAKER_05]: soil with like one part cocoa coir or one
part peat moss, and then one part native
[SPEAKER_05]: soil, and then one part warm castings or
compost.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by default, that soil recipe pretty
much works everywhere, and you'll end up
[SPEAKER_05]: with some really great soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be your base.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you can still add extra amendments
to that also if you wish.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can afford it and if you want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like farmer recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Produce gets grown on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That recipe, like in the raised
permaculture beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So- All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So can we throw that same recipe into
those 150 gallon smart pots?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I added a little more aeration to it and
maybe went a little bit heavier on the
[SPEAKER_05]: peat moss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it worked out great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stocks the size of football of two liter
gallons.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's huge, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is huge.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish you had pictures to show me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to throw out a little bit of
a soil mix that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would buy, if I were going to use 150
gallon smart pots outside, that's got to
[SPEAKER_10]: be a huge pot.
[SPEAKER_10]: How is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: About six feet around?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: About three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a kid pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about that tall.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: About 24, 28 inches ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a fucking kid pool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Filled up with jello and people wrestle in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would put, I would buy some bagged
soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not too picky about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever the store has, I like the roots
organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Tupper.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty much all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the same, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You run a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all the same different shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots has more aeration in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your Fox farm products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always feel like they need a little
perlite or something added to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they need to be sifted because there
are sticks and shit in Fox farms all the
[SPEAKER_10]: time.
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell are they doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd go with some bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter what you use.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would definitely put worm castings in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the cocoa coir, like Jesse said.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it gives the plants a little bit
of, it adds moisture to the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Their vascular system's a little more
healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just seem more hydrated with the
cocoa in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they get more flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cocoa most definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it holds water differently than peat
moss does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're like doubling down right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can use a little more nutrient.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need a little more nutrient with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to put perlite in there just to
keep it airy and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it helps you not overwater.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially in outdoor situations,
you might get a rainy ass night.
[SPEAKER_10]: That perlite will save your life.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: The peat moss, or the peat, like you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then for pest prevention, we learned
this from our good friend Sean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to King Cola, if you're
listening.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to mix in the caranja meal and neem
cakes, if we're going outdoors,
[SPEAKER_10]: just to keep those bugs away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of my personal, I mean,
yeah, you came real close to my personal
[SPEAKER_05]: recipe there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you put some oyster shell in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, very.
[SPEAKER_05]: See?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm learning the outdoor from you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't do it myself, but that's why I
bring you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a trick on the oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Add, go to the feed store and get oyster
shell for chickens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been collected off the beach.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not ground up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's whole oyster shell breaks down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes it more time to break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So put that in as a bit of a time release
and then get the powder, powderized oyster
[SPEAKER_05]: shell from your local hydro store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got two different available times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get all the way through the season.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that you're a hydro store guy that
doesn't just make a shop at the hydro
[SPEAKER_10]: store.
[SPEAKER_10]: You recommend the feed store stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, I have to pay for this shit too,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing I want to mention, you can use
bottled nutrients in your outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're just going to throw the plants
into some soil containers or dig a hole in
[SPEAKER_10]: your backyard, you can go to the store.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy some botanic care.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy some nectar of the gods.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy whatever brand they've got,
their A and B, their bloom feed solution,
[SPEAKER_10]: their bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can mix that up.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're throwing it into some outdoor
soil, you can actually mix it up kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can feed it pretty damn strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe somebody's not able bodied.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're pretty healthy dudes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We could do things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe somebody doesn't have the physical
capabilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: They could throw a few pots in the
backyard and mix up some nutrients and
[SPEAKER_10]: have somebody help them do that way
instead of having to mix up a big batch of
[SPEAKER_10]: dirt and plant these.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We would just, as a ganja farmer,
myself, an indoor ganja farmer,
[SPEAKER_10]: and Jesse, an outdoor farm boy,
I think we'd rather lead people into this
[SPEAKER_10]: way of mixing up some soil outdoors and
letting nature kind of do its thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a lot of the guesswork out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This will promote pest prevention and a
healthy environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Using those bottle nutrients isn't going
to contribute to plant health.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only going to contribute to big buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soil recipes we're talking about here,
they actually help with the healing of the
[SPEAKER_05]: earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: They contribute back to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make the soil better.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you leave there, that piece of ground
is better than it was before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose you can do that with bottle
nutrients too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just watch out for salt buildups and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not as friendly.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do grow outside, do it on your
land.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do it in some national forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be an idiot like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Clean your shit up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take your bottles inside.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Jesse said, make it better than when
you found it, just like when you go
[SPEAKER_10]: camping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make it cleaner than when you found it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pick up some trash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out four pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have told this story on some of
the older episodes or the earlier ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: A few years ago, there was a gigantic
cartel bust here in the mountains real
[SPEAKER_05]: near here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have family land that neighbors the land
where they got busted on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hiked in after the cops just to check
it out and look around.
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of trash up there was just
appalling.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up on that mountain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost brings a tear to your eye to see
that up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it accessible to folks like us?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you'd be trespassing.
[SPEAKER_10]: What if we went to clean it?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not really trespassing,
is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Bob would say anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, I was going to say, four years
ago that happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still hauling trash out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a pretty good hike.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the road or from where my cabin is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make a few trips up there a year and
haul some trash out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous how much was up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, it's ridiculous how much the cops
and the DEA left up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell the trash from the cartel
growers and you can tell the trash from
[SPEAKER_05]: the cops.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just left shit up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Dunkin' Donuts was from the cops and
the Beans and Rice was from the cartel?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my friend's dads was a police
officer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how much I'm supposed to talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not a cop anymore so they can't
probably do shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was retiring at the time and they
called him and had him go stand there and
[SPEAKER_10]: watch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once they raided, everybody ran,
but they needed the teams to get up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: The DEA and shit wanted to go and
investigate.
[SPEAKER_10]: He stood there and watched, just made sure
that nobody went in that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said that he walked around and they had
little camps set up like stoves with beans
[SPEAKER_10]: and rice.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the food was from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was all Mexican packaging and they're
straight up making Mexican dinner up there
[SPEAKER_10]: every night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the Miracle Can Grow containers that
I have cleaned up off there, they have
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican writing on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no English on them whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like segueing into the things that
I have in my mind for the show on
[SPEAKER_10]: accident, which is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you add anything to the soil mix
before we move on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you use azomite?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to write that down for next
year's lessons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like doing minerals so I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basalt,
[SPEAKER_05]: gypsum, and these are all things you can
find at your local garden stores,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially gypsum, dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all pretty easy to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I use azomite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those four combinations of minerals you
got pretty much every single trace mineral
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world covered.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to make your plants terpy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to make them healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to smell real well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then oyster shell, shrimp mill,
fish mill, something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like aqua products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stay away from bone mill, blood mill,
slaughterhouse products.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would use kelp mill if that were up to
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to write down kelp mill for my
style, just for what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use tons of kelp mill, alfalfa mill.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alfalfa breaks down really quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: That can give you some of that real early
season boost to get them exploded to
[SPEAKER_05]: pot-bottle sized stocks in four weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your plants are going to take up 90% of
their nitrogen during the vegetative phase
[SPEAKER_10]: of their lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to overspike that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why alfalfa mill is good because it
breaks down so quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the middle of flowering towards the end
of flowering, you don't want them to find
[SPEAKER_05]: a source of nitrogen that can have some
shit up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make them taste funky and it'll slow down
the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just dress the buds out a little.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll start to finger.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the little fingers, foxtails.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You said a minute ago, you cleaned up a
bunch of fucking Miracle Grow containers
[SPEAKER_10]: from that Cartel Grow site.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, if you want to Google the Cartel
Grow site, I'm sure you could find it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a Cartel Grow found in the San
Isabel National Forest area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Off Highway 165.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was about probably four or five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was well covered by the news around
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: They threw out a bunch of Miracle Grow
containers, which tells me that they
[SPEAKER_10]: probably weren't growing super quality
product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk for a minute about why we
should never use Miracle Grow or any
[SPEAKER_10]: Scotts type of product.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, Miracle Grow is made by
Scotts, which is owned by Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is trying to force the entire world
to be force fed seeds that are made by
[SPEAKER_10]: them, which are all GMO produced to be
able to be sprayed by their products that
[SPEAKER_10]: are made by them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're ruining a whole bunch of things
and not healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just fucking talking in a circle right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're killing the bees.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're real.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all about money for those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty much single-handedly
responsible for the bee die off right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not want to support anything with
Monsanto in the first place.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we don't want to use any type
of Miracle Grow or Scotts products.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're going to buy stuff like that,
go to a hydroponics store, go to your
[SPEAKER_10]: local grow store, get a decent grow soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't go get like a turf builder at Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people hate on the Fox Farm
brand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's actually available at some
of the larger hardware stores like Ace may
[SPEAKER_10]: have Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fox Farm isn't amazing, but it's
definitely not bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're going to buy something at Ace or
Home Depot or Lowe's, get Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get the Scotts brand stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: ProMix is available at most of those
places too.
[SPEAKER_05]: ProMix is a good product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunshine 4 ProMix?
[SPEAKER_10]: The Sunshine?
[SPEAKER_05]: Different companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different proprietary blends of
Mycorrhizae and Inoculation.
[SPEAKER_10]: ProMix is good shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy that in bulk.
[SPEAKER_10]: They sell that in.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're doing some outdoor ProMix,
go get that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes it in these amendments.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be golden out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about why not to use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, the obvious reason is that
they're Monsanto products, but they're way
[SPEAKER_10]: overloaded with the wrong NPK ratios.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Way too much.
[SPEAKER_10]: That soil is loaded with these little ...
They used to be green when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_10]: These little green speckles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are time release nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they're little time release
vitamins for the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: What sucks about that is you don't have
very good control of what you're feeding
[SPEAKER_10]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: However often you water, those are going
to dissolve and your plant's going to get
[SPEAKER_10]: that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want nutrients going to your
plant every single time you water.
No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to start getting salt
buildup.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to start getting crinkled
leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to see burnt tips.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your buds aren't going to taste funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't use that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't use any of that miracle grow
feeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to a real grow store.
[SPEAKER_10]: I recommend Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nectar of the Gods.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen great results from Nectar of the
Gods recently.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to my buddy, Steve Dufino.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast
bro, but you grow with Nectar of the Gods
[SPEAKER_10]: and the stuff you grow tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nectar of the Gods is good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Botanicare is good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've used advanced nutrients and I had
okay results, but I was more happy with
[SPEAKER_10]: Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_10]: Botanicare by a long shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not like Psycho at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Psycho brand I do not approve.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of brands available at the
store.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's super hot right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been paying too much attention
to the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nectar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nectar's coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a while to get people switched
over to the line from my perspective or
[SPEAKER_05]: from the retail setting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Botanicare and general hydroponics are
our base.
[SPEAKER_10]: GH is definitely reliable.
[SPEAKER_10]: General hydroponics, general organics.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Mills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen some good shit with Mills.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned last week some things about
Mills that even this organic grower is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to give them a shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Spence was killing it with the Mills.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was crushing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to Spence with the Mills.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Biobiz is always doing stuff, especially
for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kana is a great line if you want to spend
some money.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Dutch and they're well made.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jungle Juice is really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Earth Juice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see the labels.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen them in so long.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really recommend, if you're going to use
bottled nutrients, I like to add Humble
[SPEAKER_10]: Honey.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good product.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely got good stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to the Hydro store.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get yourself bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're confused, don't buy that stuff
at the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_10]: Try not to buy your soil and stuff at the
hardware store.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are grow stores somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you live somewhere, honestly,
if you live somewhere where that shit's
[SPEAKER_10]: inaccessible, maybe you're better off not
growing there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to have real big balls to grow in
that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to you if you're going to do it,
but we can't condone it and we can't
[SPEAKER_10]: encourage it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're only listening to this for
entertainment purposes where you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's illegal, but also it's not immoral.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're probably a grown ass adult.
[SPEAKER_10]: You better be a grown ass adult listening
to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: In iTunes and Stitcher, it's an 18 and
over show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got kind of ranty there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, last year in our area, we live in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the valley, but we are kind of in
a valley.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're surrounded by mountains on every
side.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other day we were in the dust bowl,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was so much wind and dirt just
blowing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought my car was getting sandblasted.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was miserable.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was cold too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was weird, but it was super sunshiny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're in this weird bowl and we get
really strange weather changes and drastic
[SPEAKER_10]: weather changes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today I used my heater and my air
conditioner, both in my car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too, several times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now it's 749 in the evening and I've
got the front door open and two windows
[SPEAKER_10]: open.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I just heard the front doors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said that that was really strange.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was looking for an open window to kind
of judge what the weather was like.
[SPEAKER_10]: The weather changes a lot here.
[SPEAKER_10]: My point is this caused a lot of folks to
get powdery mildew last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of folks that grew outdoors,
their plants were riddled with powdery
[SPEAKER_10]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I'm getting at is you've been
growing outdoors for a lot of years now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your dad's been growing outdoors for a
hundred years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to the old man.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you guys go about preventing and
taking care of powdery mildew outdoors?
[SPEAKER_05]: Prevention, planning the areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have plenty of circulation around our
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't cram them together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hollow them out in the middles.
[SPEAKER_05]: We clean, shape the legs up.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that only goes so far though.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Azomax, I mean, I can't really recommend
spraying anything on a bud, but if you
[SPEAKER_05]: have to, you have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Azomax green cleaner, just good old H2 or
hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
[SPEAKER_10]: 30% hydrogen peroxide diluted.
[SPEAKER_10]: At about 20 to 30 mils per gallon will
help keep it away, but it will not stop
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: More organically, teas would help.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could even brew a tea with like
Neem meal.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Sean would tell you to brew a nice
compost tea with some Karanja and Neem in
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're going to want to fungus
dominant to battle OPM, I believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll disrupt the pH on the surface of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like there's some plant teas you
can make.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been experimenting with chamomile,
which is, it's a natural herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: You find it in a lot of like tea blends
for like drinking, like hot tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's considered a weed in most of the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It grows naturally here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll be able to wildcraft it in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just been buying it from the health
food store right now, but it's a natural
[SPEAKER_05]: antifungal and antifungal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it makes a tea that has a higher
pH was another thing I heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with those two properties,
it battles PM pretty good, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also added benefit of it is it's
high in P and K.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just another.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to help increase trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually right now at my current run,
I gave half my Yeti OG plants a tea made
[SPEAKER_05]: of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm week five right now, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave half of them a tea made of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I gave the other half for that
feeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just got water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm kind of kicking back,
seeing what's happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to wait and see what does what.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's always a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you feel about, is it OSA 28?
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like a really great, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the numbers mixed up.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Potassium silicate, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of growers I really respect are
preaching it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't used it personally yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different kind of silica.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you mix it in with almost any of
your store bought foliar feeds,
[SPEAKER_10]: it really increases the effectiveness of
both products, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've used it in conjunction with my
integrated pest management system and my
[SPEAKER_10]: plants love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it kind of helps the, whatever you're
putting on the plants, it helps it stick a
[SPEAKER_10]: little better, I think too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It works like a sticker spreader a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got the consistency of dish soap
almost when you open up the bottle.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always stick my finger in shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm not supposed to, but I want to
know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what is this like?
[SPEAKER_10]: I smell it and play with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost taste it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes I want to, but there's Soul
Synthetics makes some products that I
[SPEAKER_10]: would drink.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you served me a cup of like,
if I went to the Monte factor and they
[SPEAKER_10]: handed me that, I'd be like, that's
fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Soul Synthetics nitrogen blend.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, let's get it on, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nectar for the God smells kind of good
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very similar to Soul Synthetics,
I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was Soul Synthetics and another
brand that I got some samples of,
[SPEAKER_10]: but there's a bunch of molasses in one of
them and it just smells so yummy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, oh, I can drink this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Humic acid and molasses together just give
you this yummy flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of that, full power, you actually
can drink and it's actually good for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a humic and fulvic, they have to
label it as humic acid, but it's actually
[SPEAKER_05]: fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: That has something to do with labeling
laws, but yeah, there's no warning on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no real MSDS for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I've heard, Jeremy from Build A Soil
talk about drinking it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what kind of got me to research it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, this guy's nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is nuts, but he's got a lot of great
ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm pretty, you know, he seems
like a guy concerned about what's going
[SPEAKER_05]: into his body.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the Dragonfly Earth medicine
products are consumable.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's mostly just alfalfa and wood.
[SPEAKER_10]: Such good stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need roots, use that Lush Roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just take your little baby clones where
the roots are showing and just roll the
[SPEAKER_10]: clones in that Lush Roots and then put
them into soil and they'll just,
[SPEAKER_10]: they'll be root bound.
[SPEAKER_10]: The next day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fat flowers is a good one too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've run too big of a crop for the price
of Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for a boutique grower for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's for three lights or less or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Insect frass is amazing, but we could
never use it at either one of our works
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's just, it's the price it would
take to make, you know, 300 gallons once a
[SPEAKER_05]: week of this shit is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of want to give a shout out to a
product, but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I've got to say about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_10]: This comes in a black bottle with a skull
on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is big time exterminator on it and
it's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's mostly organic and it's approved by
the MED rules.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like I've been adapting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I run a personal home grow, a caregiver
grow for my patients, which is all legal
[SPEAKER_10]: and legit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can do whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no, nobody looks at it,
but I adapted the same MED rules to my
[SPEAKER_10]: personal grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if they don't allow it there,
then I got to throw it away also.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no need for me to, and it keeps me
learning here also and there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It keeps me prepared for both places.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife Bernadette.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's been studying that list very good
and getting to know pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually really proud of her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Bern.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has had growers from some of our
clients calling her and asking her about
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff and what they can use and what they
can't use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause she knows more about it than the
head grower for these gigantic grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: The email out lists to everybody in
metric.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a list of all the new pesticides
and all that stuff changes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I read it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I read it often.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's actually, she tried calling the MED
to talk to them about it one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a certain lady with her name starts
with an M called her back and was not cool
[SPEAKER_05]: at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we called the department
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Agriculture and she ended up spending
about an hour on the phone with the lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are super cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: The department of ag is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they're the people that actually
regulate us one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of my hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gary had some great points on the show
that we recorded last night that hasn't
[SPEAKER_10]: been released yet of everybody that
listens to the show has heard it by now,
[SPEAKER_10]: but, and you'll hear it, but there are
some great things that kind of go along
[SPEAKER_10]: with that statement.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be entertaining.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: How the hell are we getting rid of that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Remind me again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we're mixing up some spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chamomile tea all over the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll disrupt the pH.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to make sure that we covered that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet adding some silica to that tea to
help raise the pH even more would probably
[SPEAKER_10]: be real killer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big time exterminator with some Osa 28 in
there would be really, really effective on
[SPEAKER_10]: PM is what I would assume.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have it at the store, but I've never
used it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I know that if knowing is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another one of their products too.
[SPEAKER_10]: The enzyme, big time enzyme.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big time roots, big time inoculate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should see the store.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just got a good shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are good products.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the big time.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one with coconut oil and some
other things in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really approve of that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you guys do, here's another side
note.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do have buds that have powdery
mildew on them, I know it sounds like the
[SPEAKER_10]: easy way out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not blast them and turn them into BHO.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't press them and turn them into rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to taste your burnt popcorn
and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen any powdery mildew rosin
yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know it's going to happen though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Eventually it's coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: I made a joke the other day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, well, since everybody learned how
to make BHO, nobody gets powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_10]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a sick truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: You never see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's like, I lost a whole crop to PM
or yeah, we got PM.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, no, we have a whole bunch of
shatter.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you see now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a few people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They think it's safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a chemistry student.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not qualified to give this speech,
but this is what I understand about the
[SPEAKER_10]: idea of blasting powdery mildew covered
buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some folks say that the PM will not get
through the screen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good enough if it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it won't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it'll stay in the tube.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's right there pressed up against
the screen just like your coffee and it's
[SPEAKER_10]: not getting through and only the coffee's
coming through.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what is coming through, maybe not the
spores and not the mildew, but there are
[SPEAKER_10]: mycotoxins inside of those spores that
have been extracted just like your
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids and your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been washed off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're getting the mycotoxins,
which are going to affect you in the long
[SPEAKER_10]: run.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you inhale the spores, you'll get that
sooner.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll get an infection in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll get an irritation.
[SPEAKER_10]: The mycotoxins are going to take a little
while to infect your body and it's going
[SPEAKER_10]: to be different.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have fungus inside your
body.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got mycotoxins running around inside
your lungs now.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to get in your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know enough about that,
but I do know that it's not a good idea
[SPEAKER_10]: because you're just washing the mycotoxins
off the mildew into your hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then people are going to make edibles out
of that hash sometimes and they're going
[SPEAKER_10]: to consume and eat that shit and they're
going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is supposed to be something that
improves the quality of people's lives,
[SPEAKER_10]: not makes us sicker, not fucks us up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So please do not blast your powdery mildew
buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing that I recommend,
I've never done this, shout out to Sean
[SPEAKER_10]: and Jordan.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else to call them,
Sean and Jordan, some friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_10]: They say that you can take the 30%
hydrogen peroxide and put it in distilled
[SPEAKER_10]: water and you can make that up and they
say you can dunk your PM covered buds or
[SPEAKER_10]: PM dosed buds in that and then hang them
up and they will dry and that will cure
[SPEAKER_10]: your powdery mildew problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm skeptical.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that I can recommend that.
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody has done that, email me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love to hear your experience with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: On that subject, I've heard that you can
wash your buds the exact same way like
[SPEAKER_05]: your outdoor buds to wash the dirt and
stuff off of them, doing that exact same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing, but without the hydrogen peroxide,
just water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anyone's done that, let Jeff know
about that too because I'd like to hear.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a friend named Donovan who was known
as DJ Danky online back in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I'm supposed to say his
real name and his online name.
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't exist anymore, so we're cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: He used to say that he would rinse his
buds off just like a week before harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, I just go in there and rinse
them off with a spray bottle and hose them
[SPEAKER_10]: down just to get all the dust off of them,
which is a good idea because in my
[SPEAKER_10]: opinion, all that dust that you kick up
during the grow season, it's been windy as
[SPEAKER_10]: shit out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: If people got plants out, if it's this
windy in the middle of the flowering
[SPEAKER_10]: season, people are going to have buds that
are just covered in dirt on one side.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going into your hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just going to blast that right into
the pot of gold right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dirt extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to taste like earth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe cleaning off the buds is a good idea
in this region.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try it this summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds lazy, but in my personal grow
room, I quit sweeping around week six.
[SPEAKER_10]: The buds are getting sticky.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's real sticky and I don't want
to stir up any dust or dirt off of the
[SPEAKER_10]: floor into those buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will let it get funky from about week.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a lot of shit on the floor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not either eating snacks or anything,
but there are leaves and you spill soil
[SPEAKER_10]: when you kick pots occasionally and shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't sweep sometimes from week six or
seven until after harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right at the end of harvest, I'll cut off
all the leaves pre-harvest and then sweep
[SPEAKER_10]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cut down the plants, pre-harvest,
cut down the plants and then sweep up and
[SPEAKER_10]: clean up and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Spray the whole room with hydrogen
peroxide water and fucking clean it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, bomb it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Clean it up, redo the flooring,
fix all the ducting.
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be a whole episode,
what to do between grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can probably talk for six weeks about
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an untouched subject a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been going for about 40 minutes,
dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we gave the folks a decent start.
[SPEAKER_10]: All we did was tell them how to mix up
some soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dig some big holes and put all that stuff
inside of it and then put your little baby
[SPEAKER_10]: plants in there about May 15th to June
5th-ish and then keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep them watered decently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just real quick, do your soil at least two
weeks before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cover the top of the hole with plastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That helps accelerate the composting
process of the raw amendments being broken
[SPEAKER_05]: down and being plant available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Earthworms are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, throw some worms in there if you
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mulching is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your hole size too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of depends on the size of your
plant and how big it can get, but at least
[SPEAKER_05]: three by three hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: With cannabis, you only need to go down
about 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need to try to fill a fucking
six foot hole full of highly enriched
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets expensive quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just a lot of work and it gets
really expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go get you some bales of pearl mix.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good start.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, thanks for coming and being on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell everybody how they can follow you on
social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I shout out mine?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude, shout it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can follow me on Instagram at Jesse
Gros.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hit me up on Facebook if you know
how to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also check out my podcast that I
would have never started without being on
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff's show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's already taught me a lot and
everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you guys talk about on the
Colorado podcast?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis, lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the other hosts is 44.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he has his special little flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to 44.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our other host- We call him 44
and two now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried calling him 45.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't think that was too funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still on the team.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my good lifelong friend,
Despicable Derek, Dank Derek, whatever you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to call him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirty Derek.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is pretty involved- Is that Fish?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fish?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard him called Fish in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fish number two, because all of us that
have known him a long time know his cousin
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all met the cousin first.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's Fish number one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's backup Fish.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's real active in the local hip hop
and music scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he adds that to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are quite a bit more unorthodox
than Jeff's very professional show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we cuss and talk about a few gross
things and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we've done that on this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that here.
[SPEAKER_10]: 44 has been on this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember a moose knuckle episode or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint's been here also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, true, true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you listen to the podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do message me and let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to get together.
[SPEAKER_10]: He left something here last time you were
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it wasn't his virginity.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that stole it from me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're going to wrap up the show on
that note.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, thanks for coming and taking an hour
out of your day.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take some dabs before you
leave, smoke some of the Spherx.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody out there is interested in
sponsoring a podcast or if you'd like a
[SPEAKER_10]: product or if you've got a product you'd
like us to review, I don't have any
[SPEAKER_10]: paperwork to read off of.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going no script lately, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free balling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free forming.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing that too.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a product you'd like me to
review, I will not talk about free balling
[SPEAKER_10]: in the advertisement of your product or as
I review your product.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you've got a product you'd like me
to review or if you'd like to advertise on
