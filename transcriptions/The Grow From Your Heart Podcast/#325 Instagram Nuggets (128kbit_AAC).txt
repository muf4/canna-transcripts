[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll put your clip in the next
Instagram live episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, before this intro
gets too long, let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's episode 325 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if you're trying to get all
that reclaim out of your rig so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use it, it's a good idea to make
edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to dry it out and smoke it,
you could do that, but edibles is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to go if you're going to recycle
your reclaim.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to get it out of the rig
without destroying it is to run the tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water, get the tap water super hot,
and then just fill the rig with hot water
[SPEAKER_00]: and pour it out into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the rig and the water are really hot,
it'll come out really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cold, that shit's just going to
stick and make a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a solvent in there to loosen it
up, you're going to ruin the reclaim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to get it out is probably
just hot water and pour it into something
[SPEAKER_00]: and collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pour it onto some parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how to collect it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't fuck with reclaim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit stuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw the reclaim away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good way to catch a reclaim,
you guys, and make it more usable and to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it from the water is a drop down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put a drop down on your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: A drop down is a piece that goes from the
joint of your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drops down at an angle and then it goes
back up and you put your nail on the up
[SPEAKER_00]: part and your reclaim will gather in the
bottom of the drop down instead of making
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the water of your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more accessible and it's easier to
smoke from there than it is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I would do with the reclaim
if you were trying to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse says, Chem 4, Chem D or Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer is yes, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I like the Chem 4 because
it's chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it smells like when you open a can
of tennis balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fresh can of tennis balls has a really
certain smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a, I don't know, a certain,
it smells like Chem 4, but it's got like a
[SPEAKER_00]: tires kind of a thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D, I don't know that I've got enough
experience with real Chem D to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem 91, I love that nasty, skunk,
funk, terrible smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to grow it, probably Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to smoke it, Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need more information, Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck Mary Kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck Chem 4, Mary Chem 91 and Kill Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we just played around a fuck Mary
Kill with cannabis strains, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, what was your view on
11 on and 13 off to mimic the tropics?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking about light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 hours on, 13 hours off for the plants
to mimic the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves you an hour of electricity,
which over a 65 day flowering cycle is 65
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each bulb that you don't have to run
that cools your equipment a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also when you're doing a phenohunt,
I think a longer dark period gives your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants more time to show a phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see more variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the plants actually do what
they're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may affect your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may affect positively or negatively
depending on your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was DJ Short that was saying 11
on 13 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's probably where you heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short on a high times form.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one of the panels on Free Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably on that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably where you heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll save you, like I said, it'll save
you one hour every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over a 63, 65 day flowering cycle,
that's 65 hours worth of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're running four lights,
that's 65 times four is 240 is 270 fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: right, 260 hours of lighting that you're
saving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quick math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fucking hold me to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show more phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring out more flavors and more
turps too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, question for you Rasta
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do an open pollination with a
single male, do you put it in the room at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time as your girls when you start
flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like Grateful Dog wants to be
pollinated around day 25 of its life of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Skunk wants pollen closer to day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to put the male in the room to
get him pollinating, to get him flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get him pollinating to where when the
Grateful Dog plant wants pollen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Skunk plant wants pollen,
that male has got pollen ready for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I've got to time it to where the
Lemon Skunk plant and that Grateful Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: plant are ready for pollen on the same
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means I've got to put the male in
the room a few days ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what plants I'm working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which plants I need to do this with
because I've done it a few times now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to put the male in the room first,
get him going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of put him in a separate space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's far from all the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's in there flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will put the Lemon Skunk in there
because it's got to get ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will put, I'll wait like,
what is it, six or seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: let the Lemon Skunk get ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll throw that Grateful Dog in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're actually perfectly timed
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like one went in way late and
one went in early, but when pollen comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one's going to have fat pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are going to start forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shorter, squatter your Indica
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to get as tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get, it doesn't take as
much time to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to be pollinated earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Lemon Skunk plant needs a little more
time to stretch out and give me all those
[SPEAKER_00]: little bud sites to create seed sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I got to stagger them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boy goes in first, then the Lemon
Skunk, then the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on what else I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, I've got seeds available
on dankseed.store and somebody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: know if the Blueberry Cookies packs are
all the same or is the S1 pack different
[SPEAKER_00]: than the one not labeled S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how they've got them labeled
on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a look and see what they've
got going on up there, but this is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to talk about S1s and R1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a label for Femini seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally you see things like F1 or F2 or
BX or IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're starting to see on Femini seed
packages, you're seeing R1 and S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: R1 means a reversal and R1 means I
reversed a plant and I used its pollen on
[SPEAKER_00]: a different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And S1 is if I were to reverse a plant and
put that pollen on the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only selfing if you're putting the
pollen on itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're putting the pollen on something
else, it's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So S1 is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a selfed one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only gonna have that plant's genes in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other genetics, no other adulterations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gonna be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be just Blueberry Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the Blueberry Cookies girl and I
put reversed Blueberry Cookies pollen on
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it is selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is seeds of itself S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take that Blueberry Cookies pollen
just as I did and I throw it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum Tangi, I have now made a
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a self because I've opened up
the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put something else in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the difference between an R1 and
an S1, a reversal and a selfed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conversation was we were talking
about reversing plants and using reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: males or reversed females for breeding and
what the future of that holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was making sure to support the
idea of making Femini seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a reason for Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people hate on Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people bash Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot of people's cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people feel about Femseed the way
I feel about autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a reason and a good purpose
for Femini seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the reason why I recently
reversed a clone of Blueberry Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow for a large facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those flowers for that facility
were smoked by a very well known breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: who has been in this game for longer than
I could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the first few and he's still
killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's ahead of the game now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm supposed to disclose
who I did this project for or not because
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually commissioned to make these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, this breeder who used to be well
known on Hash Church and IGC and
[SPEAKER_00]: overgrowthegovernment.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy was a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he was a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy smoked some of the flowers
that came from my facility and he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit, that's got such an amazing
flavor, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we told him what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, can I have some seeds of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, there are no seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, make me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed it to make seeds for him
because he thinks it's got some amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: very unique terps and he wants to use it
in his breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he is in another country so there's no
way to get him a plant safely,
[SPEAKER_00]: legally, discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get a clone of the Blueberry
Cookies to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can very easily get him some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can get the seeds to his own country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal for him to travel there with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is illegal for him to travel there with
a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he can take the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I did was reverse the Blueberry
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it back on a Blueberry Cookies
female and I made S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's going to show very close
representations of that Blueberry Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be just like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a little bit variance
closer to mom, closer to dad, but most of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are going to be the Blueberry Cookies
that I started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's got that Blueberry Cookies and I
didn't adulterate it by adding another
[SPEAKER_00]: male or another female to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what would have happened if I
would have taken a rise or whatever other
[SPEAKER_00]: male I've got and put pollen on there,
I would have adulterated it and watered
[SPEAKER_00]: down that original genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now he's got the original Blueberry
Cookies seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an S1 version, a selfed version of
the Blueberry Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the advantage of working with
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main advantage, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, man, sometimes you just want to
breed some shit and you don't have a male
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and the best way to do it is to
reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that what comes from that Blueberry
Cookies reversal is going to be amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've seen what the female
Blueberry Cookies plant does and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already know that what I use it for,
you can already see 50-50 what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen because you're working with two
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the advantage of making
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hated on FEM seeds for years,
but they definitely speed up your
[SPEAKER_00]: selection process by years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people in Colorado now,
we're getting limited on plant counts
[SPEAKER_00]: lower and lower every time, every year,
they drop our plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to be able to grow tons of fucking
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got empty grow rooms because
we can't grow as many plants as we used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be allowed to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just unplug shit, gave grow equipment
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're down to very low numbers of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they keep going lower, it's not even
going to be worth having a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that are limited to six plants,
they want all six of the seeds that they
[SPEAKER_00]: pop to be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have time to fuck with a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't run six because they think
they're going to flower six.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a space, they've got six pots,
they grow that boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, now I got to wait till the whole
next cycle to run six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wasting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can't run extra, they can't
run 10 and then cull the boys because now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're already over their limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So six is the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to run all six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why FEM seeds are good for those
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rid of those dudes first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, any dude that auto flowers,
you get the fuck rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress him, get him root bound,
overfeed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he starts to auto flower, get rid of
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's why it takes me so long to
find a new male, you guys, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: abused the shit out of him before I take
it to a breeding room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's a rant that I like to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you've got a pack of 10 seeds and if
you're going to breed, I hope you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 10 seeds, but 10 is a good
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember to talk about, say you've got 10
seeds and you're going to breed out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you're like just a hobby breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh man, I really want to
start breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to buy a pack of Rasta Jeff's
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: My podcast today is going to be about the
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a pack of the cream and I
want to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get, hopefully science
dictates, you're going to get five males,
[SPEAKER_00]: five females, or somewhere in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get four and six or five
and five, somewhere around there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've got, I'm going to say
for the sake of my ramble here that we got
[SPEAKER_00]: five males and five females.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a male to breed,
you put those five females aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't count right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first male that flowers, the first
one that starts dropping his balls real
[SPEAKER_00]: big, cut them down, throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to breed with that one at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all at all, get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the male that's going to dominate
your cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one that is going to be just a
reproduction of that plant to everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed it to star dog, if you breed
it to daybreaker, if you breed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum tangy, it's all going to come out
like male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to ruin your crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be that male all over
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second one, you're getting a little
closer to what you want, but if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: five boys, I usually find myself using the
third or fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third or fourth out of five are
usually what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two that go, too dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That third one, he's usually the one
that's got the right structure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: right shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth one is usually right behind
there and the fifth one is usually too
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That boy that is way fucking tall,
I get rid of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be real dominant also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he likes to stretch, so say your girls
are two feet tall, you'll have a boy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get rid of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that he just makes tall,
tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes plants that want to get up above
everybody so that when the pollen comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down, it rains down, but his girls also do
that also it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a 10 pack, you pull out five
girls, you got five left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those first two boys, get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three and four, those are your breeding
prospects most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, he's going to be tall and
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably not the one you want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just from years of breeding and
experimenting and going through boy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, that's what I have learned from
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I don't believe in genetic drift,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never experienced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people fuck up plants and try to
take unhealthy clones that are shitty just
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I've been given those types of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying I'm looking at these clones
and these clones are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been given terrible clones and I've
revived them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cloned off of that a hundred
times and they've been stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the flow that I work with,
let's talk about flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flow has been through hell and back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had flow since 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bitch puts out still.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been through house moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been through meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I got the flu and I was so sick
that I looked up at my garden and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, that needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw up and went back to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much I cared about my plants
because I was so fucking sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that flow, she almost went,
but she's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloned off of her, she's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that flow is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of my plants were going to show me
some genetic drift, flow would have told
[SPEAKER_00]: me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would have been like, look,
genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not happening, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have experienced it by now because
when I was a new grower, I was a horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow game was on point from the
beginning, but my clone game was weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't clone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend who got me into
easy cloning and taught me how to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then shout out to my new friend who really
stepped up my fucking cloning game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really think that I believe too
much in genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that I support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some new gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is actually, thanks for the
compliment on the sound gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I record the podcast on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just running into a Mackie mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Mackie 1402 that I've had for a
hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I run that into a DBX compressor
because I like the compression and the
[SPEAKER_00]: sound gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like watch, this is what it really sounds
like in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear all that fucking noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear the hum?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my nose, but watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you turn on a little compression and
sound gate and it's fucking clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the podcast gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a compressor here, a DBX compressor,
a two channel DBX compressor that runs
[SPEAKER_00]: into a Tascam US 1200, which is what takes
me digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little preamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the mixer that gives me a little turbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me plus 48 to make my mic a
little hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the gain up quite high,
quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make it, I like the game pretty high on
my mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it so you can hear everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the bass turned up a little bit on
my voice just because it gives it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more boom and it makes me less nasally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can hear, I got some shit in the
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes that out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned the compression up quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the gate quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I run through garage band and I
don't think you guys hear, you do hear the
garage band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garage band effects also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just run a noise gate on garage band and
then there's a, a bass booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run two different tracks at the same
time on garage band and they have two
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They layer and it just makes me sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it thicker and bolder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, is all it really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't run any exciters or DS or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to keep it mostly simple,
but thanks for the sound compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me rant about my sound
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that made sense to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John Henry 10 60 says, how often do you
change your cloner water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I do not change the cloner
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those clones are only in the cloner for
10, 12, maybe 14 days at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't feel the need to change the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I add a whole bunch of clear
res.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a 180 site cloner that I like to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Botanicare 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just prefer that one lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the most reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sprayers are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't clog up as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will put the water in the cloner to
the desired level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill it just below the PVC halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is touching the bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I add clone X, the purple clone X
liquid solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add that until the EC is at 1.1 or 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go 1.0 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hold your EC pin in there,
pour in, go ahead and pour in like 250
[SPEAKER_00]: mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spin your EC pin around in that water and
see what the EC is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep adding until you get it to
about 1.0 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you got water with solution in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then cut your clones, dip them in the
clone X, put them in the plugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: drop it in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it run for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that purple shit's gonna fall off of
your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple clone X gel is gonna fall into
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it run for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go do some other shit and come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unplug it, pop it open and check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point pH it to somewhere,
6.0 is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.2 will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somewhere between 5.9 and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH that shit to 5.9 and 6.2 and you will
be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then add about 200 to 250 mils of clear
res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pour it right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear res and then do that every five
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add the clear res every five days,
you will not have to change your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clear res will take care of any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put some clear res in there and you
don't have to change the cloner water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it's done, pour two cups of
bleach in there and let it keep running
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then dump it all out and clean it out
and you'll be fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throw the clone plugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy new clone plugs unless you're using
permaclone clone collars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using permaclones, clean those
out appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell you how to do them when you
bought them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using those, use those again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at permaclone
clone collars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the cheap ones,
throw them away by new ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suggest you check out permaclone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could get beans from any time and
place, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a crazy question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to fly around to like three or
five places in the 70s and get beans
[SPEAKER_00]: before shit was adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to go to Thailand, Vietnam,
Afghanistan, and some sort of South
[SPEAKER_00]: American stuff, but I don't know where.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'd like to have some of those seeds
that Chem Dog had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 13 beans that Chem Dog had,
I'd like to have 10 of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rolled.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of the way things timed out
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity to get Granny and
Giddy on the show.

together already, so that's how they came
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get back to the Grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get that going.
