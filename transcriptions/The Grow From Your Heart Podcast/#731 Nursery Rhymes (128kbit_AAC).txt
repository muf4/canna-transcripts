[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot to ramble about here at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make this show super long at the
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it and get into a
message that came from our Patreon page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my buddy Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy Tonto out there in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the family is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My message from my buddy Tonto goes a lot
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, I have a couple
of questions that I think might be good
[SPEAKER_00]: for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great spot to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have a bunch of medical
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make gardening a struggle during
certain parts of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My PTSD, depression and back issues make a
lovely cocktail of reasons not to get my
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that with a lot of PTSD,
depression, back issues, that's three
[SPEAKER_00]: solid excuses to not get out of bed,
not get off the couch, not get shit done
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says those conditions are the main
reasons I've pulled enough or been pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: into organic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found ways to make the workload easier
or less growing with this style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that there are many others
out there like me who struggle to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden in tip top shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you advise someone with medical
conditions as the minimum things you would
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do both in veg and flour to keep
everything going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, I'm not sure exactly where to
start for everybody, but I can give you
[SPEAKER_00]: tips and advice for your needs and for
possibly my needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got different, uh,
limiting factors, then I'm not sure what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you ask, what are the minimum
things you would need to do both in veg
[SPEAKER_00]: and garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what advice would you give somebody the
minimum things the plants need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: watered?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important thing,
uh, as a cannabis grower who likes to go
[SPEAKER_00]: places, likes to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I think about is are
these plants going to get water?
[SPEAKER_00]: So set the plants up in a way that you can
water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the water itself accessible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it come from a faucet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it come from a sink, a shower,
some sort of a tap, a well, do you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking pull the water out of the lake?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does the water come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the water easily accessible,
easily portable to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to water these plants at least
twice, maybe three or four times a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe set it up to where it's easy to
water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's easier to water it, you'll do it
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your, let's even back up a
whole nother step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your entire grow space clean,
tidy and organized and inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that when my workspace,
if it's my office, if it's my garage
[SPEAKER_00]: workspace, if it's my grow workspace,
if it's the podcast area, when that space
[SPEAKER_00]: gets cluttered and it's not inviting and
presentable, my mind is cluttered when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I can't perform to the best of
my ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make sure to keep my grow space as
clean as I can, my nutrient mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: station, my nutrient storage area,
all of that stuff is it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: military grade cleaning happened in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that invites me to want to go in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go in there and go, I got to move
this shit out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to look for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, I can go in this place where it is
organized and streamlined and ready for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the very beginning, have
everything clean, organized, streamlined,
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go so that you can set yourself
up for success and be invited in there by
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe put some music in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love listening to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And music, if there's a Bluetooth speaker
and a bottle of kombucha, I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty happy just about anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give me a dab first, things are
really iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to put on a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people listen to me in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're having a good day in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I'm getting you through work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope things aren't too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're kicking ass today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing your job pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep killing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also go take that work poop work poop
and get paid for it while the boss is not
[SPEAKER_00]: looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people put on a podcast
during the workday, but listen to some
[SPEAKER_00]: music, put a Bluetooth speaker in there,
get some AirPods, some earbuds,
[SPEAKER_00]: something in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That encourages you to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out two shows a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably got a water at least twice a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two episodes of me to listen to
two days of growing covered right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to listen to some rush,
go put on some Neil pier and jam out to
[SPEAKER_00]: some Russian there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just picking on you because you're
Canadian, but I still love you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but encourage and inspire yourself to go
in there before we even start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room is everything organized,
clean, inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it look good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if it's not organized and inviting,
I won't want to go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not organized and inviting,
I won't want to go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still not going to work to the best of
my, uh, potential, my ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make it inviting, get some music,
go and make it an environment in which you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the things that are required of,
of the grower is of course the watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing you're going to
need to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get the water to the grow without
breaking your back or your neck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get that water from a big vessel
into the mixing container without breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: your neck or your back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good mixing container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good pH pan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good EC pan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have good mixing containers and
devices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe if you have a couple of extra
bucks, spend a few bucks on devices to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the growing more simplistic,
more streamlined and more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: More toys makes it better for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get, if you get that brand new
piece of gear, it just may inspire you to
[SPEAKER_00]: regrow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a new toy every once in a while
reward yourself with a new piece of gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mainly keep it clean and get it set
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now watering, we've got to get an amount
of water from one container into these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you physically do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, let's think about setting up a
watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can build a watering system with
any sort of reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a trash can, a 35 or 55
gallon trash can on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can move it to the water,
fill it, move it where it needs to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: drop a submersible pump in there,
run some flex line that runs out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir down to the ground, down across
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will put spaghetti tubing that
comes out of that with emitters that go to
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just set that up with a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know that, um, depending on the
amount of emitters and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters and the amount of plants that
I've gotten, how much water I want,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can set up a timer to where I know that
if I turn on the water for, or if I turn
[SPEAKER_00]: on the timer for two minutes, that pump
runs for two minutes, my plants will get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the first time you do it, you guys,
if you want to learn that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: get your plants to where they need water,
get your auto watering system set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: set a timer, hit go, plug in your pump,
let the plants get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're watered enough, hit stop on
the timer, unplug the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long you need your plants to
come on your timer to come on to water
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants every time minute and 40
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get the plant saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time how long between waterings,
maybe every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every third day, you need a minute and
40 seconds worth of watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that hard to set up once
you get figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you'll have to do is
auto watering or some sort of watering
[SPEAKER_00]: that is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get through without that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants are likely going to need
some sort of supports as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're going to need up pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's things you're going to need to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go from a ceiling into a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then my cup goes into a three gallon,
maybe a one, uh, depending on my time
span.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space needs, but I'll go from a cup to a
maybe a one gallon, maybe right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from a three, maybe to a five or
a seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but think about your pot sizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the up pots that you're going
to have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to have to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then supports, uh, the plants are going to
get taller and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need more support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put a trellis net?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put sticks in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's things that will be required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some watering, some up potting,
some supporting, and then a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not required, but it will
definitely help you and make things
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to think of things that we
have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering is the main thing you have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supports, uh, lollipopping, twisting,
things like that are all bonuses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, they should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just thinking of the minimum things
as watering and keeping the light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: going and just keeping the plants
supported and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that being said, I want to
inspire you to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that every day that you don't
get up and get in there and do your best
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden, the harvest will show you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: As depressed as down as you want,
you could push it off or you can go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and kick ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to show you until the
backend until you go to cut down at
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to say, man, if I would have
gone in there that one day when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: having that problem and I just didn't feel
like it, if I would have gone in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: spent one hour in there and just handled
this issue, this harvest weight would be
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This harvest quality would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This harvest, this harvest experience
overall would be more rewarding and would
[SPEAKER_00]: be more better, more better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be more rewarding for you
spiritually and mentally and financially
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think that's what I use as inspiration and
motivation when I don't want to do any
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just go do it when it's done,
I'm going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reward within itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every little job that you do is a
small reward that leads up to the big full
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplishment of the big picture of the
goal, which feels very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, I know Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Tonto was a former military
person, so I know you know that feeling of
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, you know, that feeling of
pride, dig inside and feel that feeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: compare the feelings inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're laying there, go, man,
I could either lay here and let this
[SPEAKER_00]: depression crush me today, or,
or I could get up and crush the depression
[SPEAKER_00]: and go spend time with my plants,
which I love, which are like my little
[SPEAKER_00]: children, which put off good vibes,
which feed me good energy, which in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: months also is going to give me quality
medicine and a big reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should just get up and not,
not let this depression, not to let this
[SPEAKER_00]: win today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I had a traumatic brain injury where
for several months I thought about doing
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible shit to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, guys, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way past that, but that was years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it first happened, I questioned if I
would make it to tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand the, uh, the lack of
desire, the lack of passion, the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to get up and do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care if I got up and ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care if I got up to pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about just pissing right there
because I was so depressed and so dark
[SPEAKER_00]: that who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just piss on myself anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you just got to dig deep, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to dig deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep inside of yourself and, and think
that your mind is playing tricks on you
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you are the winner of that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to win every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that shit beat you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, the bare minimum is watering,
transplanting, supporting, and then after
[SPEAKER_00]: that, everything else is bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to feed them and you got to change
the light cycle, but they will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends that leave town for several
months at a time because they've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto watering system and it just keeps
their grow going for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it will happen, but the more you do to
it, the better it will become.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to say would be
the motive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motivating factor, the thing that
would get you in there is just knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: like I can grow some C grade weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that on my fucking sleep,
but if I want to grow a grade weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to touch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that in an episode before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference between a gray and C
grade weed is just doing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I should really mention
is that I invite you to join my discord
[SPEAKER_00]: server.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds like advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds cheesy, but honestly,
bro, um, during these weird times where we
[SPEAKER_00]: were isolated through a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to sit at home and we weren't
allowed to go places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord is where I spent a lot of time
hanging out with some of my best and
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite friends in my discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have amazing deep conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all grown adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all grown people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are men and women.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a transgender, they're gay,
straight color, black, white, purple
[SPEAKER_00]: people in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people of all ethnicity,
ethnicities, races, genders, orientations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a really good time hanging out
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeling depressed, if you're
feeling alone, if you need some
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement, if you need a grow buddy,
just to pep talk you or just someone to be
[SPEAKER_00]: around to get the dark shit out of your
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out on the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm lonely, bored, need some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my girlfriend's working or if she's
asleep, cause she goes to bed way earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: than me, or if I just need someone to talk
me through some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm a business owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord is where I go to talk to some of
my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's busy when it goes to bed early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord crew is who I turn to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my favorite people are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, if you're feeling dark,
feeling weird, need that encouragement,
[SPEAKER_00]: need some grow bros, uh, come join us on
the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I am a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be there more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've made a pledge to kind of be there
more often because it, uh, it got weird
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're fixing it and making the vibe
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shit heads a lot on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that may not be the answer you're
looking for, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minimum shit that has to happen is
they have to be watered other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pretty much grow, feed them,
water them, make sure they don't fall
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do it, but you've got to
dig deep and get the motivation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: inspiration to get in there and make those
plants champions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't want to smoke C grade or
B grade weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that when you're feeling down,
all you gotta do is get in there and do
[SPEAKER_00]: the work and you can make that a grade
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use that as your inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then reach out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, message me, message the army,
join the discord, get involved with some
[SPEAKER_00]: people, get some, uh, brain juices moving,
get yourself out of that dark mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have hopes and dreams of opening a
cannabis nursery within Canada sometime in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nurseries can have up to 50 meters squared
or 5,000 or 538 square foot of canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to be selling clones and seeds in
the legal market here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have two questions based on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are nurseries viable businesses in the
States in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have that allotted space,
how would you run it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And any advice to someone who may jump
into that market?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a very general and broad
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's talk about this clone nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not something that we see,
uh, completely dedicated to clones here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough of a market in my
opinion to just sell clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one company that I know of that
focuses on just clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to do okay, but there's only one
company I know of that really does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two different ways that clones
kind of work here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make clones and provide clones for
the commercial market, which means you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a big kind of sounds like what you
would try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your big warehouse and you would
cut hundreds of clones, maybe thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, probably hundreds of thousands of
clones, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would offer those clones to other
commercial facilities and they would buy
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would just run your cuts in
their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many commercial facilities do rely on
somebody to provide those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy them every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is a lot of facilities will
buy clones from you one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find their favorites and they cut a
clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they never have to buy clones
from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the downsides to making
clones for the commercial market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once everybody has their stuff,
they just start making their own clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to call you anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how the clone game works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other option is making clones for the
consumer end of the market, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great idea, but also there are only so
many consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People only grow so much weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think there are so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rules in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure if you can sell a clone
to somebody from out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to have a Colorado ID to even
be able to purchase a clone in a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that because I've got the ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, uh, the steps and skips
and caveats to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, for a while, my dream,
and I don't think I'm going to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore so I could talk about it,
but there was, there were goals and plans,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I kind of shifted my focus here,
uh, just because of life and paperwork and
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my goals was to open a giant
commercial cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, one of my dreams was to make seeds for
the recreational market in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be able to put.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics beans on the shelf here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that would be great to walk into a
store and see the seeds, but there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much red tape that it's almost,
it's basically not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to put seeds on the store
shelf, which would have required me to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce those seeds and a commercially
licensed grow, which then would have given
[SPEAKER_00]: me the advantage and the ability to sell
those clones to commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell clones to commercial grows,
sell seeds to recreational stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the same time also possibly offer
those clones to the recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I did a lot of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of crunching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have barely made any profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that we think this would have
been profitable is if we did a crop where
[SPEAKER_00]: we produce seeds and then sold all the
seeds and then did a crop of producing
[SPEAKER_00]: seedless flower and sold the flower to
supplement the income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the meantime, the flower would
be building hype for the seeds and be
[SPEAKER_00]: building hype for the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the clones would be in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds would be in demand and we'd sell
more flower and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a, hoping to make a cycle
out of that, but honestly it got,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with all the licensing fees,
uh, the licensing fees, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and the rules and regulations and all
that, it got a little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of just, I guess we sort of
abandoned ship on that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess things were working the way that
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike got to Mike had two kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I retook off the way that it took off
and we kind of abandoned ship that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just clones in my opinion does not
look, fell, look, smell, feel,
[SPEAKER_00]: or seem like a viable option unless you
could develop contracts with commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities that will be
relying on you to supply those cuts every,
[SPEAKER_00]: however frequently you need, uh,
they need them and you can supply them
[SPEAKER_00]: probably every, uh, 90 75, maybe every 21
days, depending on how they set up their
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 21 days we were cutting clones,
uh, putting stuff into flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 day flip turnarounds there because we
had the rooms divided to where 21 days is
[SPEAKER_00]: the gap in between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, if you've got somewhere for
those clones to go, it may be a viable
[SPEAKER_00]: business, but without a predetermined
customer for that many clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know you could get that many cuts
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I could be wrong because in the
great nation of Canada, you guys can mail
[SPEAKER_00]: shit to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have national legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got state by state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization and things cannot leave each
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's highly illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the advantage in Canada,
you can mail things from one end of Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: to the other or in the middle or all over
that may be advantageous to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't honestly know the clone market
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, again, unless you've got that
commercial account or you've got some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, commercial availability where you
can advertise and say, we'll ship clones
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't know if it would work with
that catch with that bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may work for you, but I don't want to
lead you the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I rambled on enough about that
part of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, any other possible events you will be
at this year, other than the groovy gravy
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I could not make that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes, I understand you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend are Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you could not make the groovy
gravy secret stash event in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do not know of any upcoming
events in Colorado at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few events coming up in other
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's something in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's stuff on the East coast
coming up, but I don't know of anything
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up in Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, with a lot of the rule
changes, we cannot smoke at any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: events in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically illegal to consume inside
of a public building like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where people are gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't really smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're either allowed to do business or
consume and you don't, you don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: get to do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are opening up consumption places
and things like that are changing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's taking a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do not know of any events
coming up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do, I will let you know, especially
of events, which I am attending and
[SPEAKER_00]: vending, because I like to let the people
know where I will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people come and meet me, shake my
hand, give me a fist bump, say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me how long they've been listening to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me pictures of their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me smell the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will definitely let everybody know
when they're more, when there are more
[SPEAKER_00]: events coming up to celebrate and
congregate for, um, let's see,
[SPEAKER_00]: what else do I have on this message?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, I hope all as well from
your friend Tonto, a big shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Tonto up there in Canada,
Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions about your
clone nursery ideas, I would love to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me more Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get that dialed in for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more questions again,
I don't know the details about the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: up there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very limited in my clone sales here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could only sell to the, uh, Colorado
residents and also Colorado commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they've got them,
they clone them and they don't buy them
[SPEAKER_00]: very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only new grows will be buying clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in Canada where you can ship
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That opens you up to every single Canadian
is able to buy clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be completely wrong in my idea
that it would not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a different business plan than
I had available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to be quite stuttery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to drag this episode out too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it a short one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it a sweet one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can come back and do a better
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next show, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
Paul and Chuckers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening to
another short episode of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for this being short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stuttery.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice sounds like shit in my
headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make it quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one will be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the encouragement
that will flow in from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
