[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the rambling at the start of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a great question here right in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from our friend something
different and it goes a little bit just
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope all is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope things are well in your life,
your garden, whatever you've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it is all well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a good holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say quick breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what is the difference between BX
and F1, F2, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits of doing a BX?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but I just can't grasp
the concept of back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he says BX in this, it does mean back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be indicated as BX or BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I don't understand the concept of
back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a way of explaining things for a
broad audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping you'd be able to help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you do and to stay iry
from some.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you write that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy, something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that I have a way
of teaching that a lot of people can
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my main focuses and goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say that I kind of ramble and
repeat myself, but I understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: people learn in different ways and I want
to make sure that everybody follows along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about this concept of a
back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good place to start is why would we want
a back cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would somebody want to make a back
cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help us understand why and then
that will also help me explain how and
[SPEAKER_00]: again why it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about a back
cross here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very common and practical reason for
making back crosses is maybe you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant that you want to put into
seed form, but you do not have a male of
[SPEAKER_00]: that same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes amazing buds, amazing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all the qualities you would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put that in seed form,
but you don't have a male plant of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were going to use a different plant,
that is not a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be adulterating the original mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make a feminized plant out of
this plant and not adulterate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many growers, many people do not
prefer feminized plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people think there's something wrong
with the fem seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people just don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is myth and misconception and
miseducation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're here for today,
but a lot of people don't want the fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of getting a feminized seed,
our next solution is to create a back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very good example that I can talk to you
about back cross and use very well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching guideline, because I have done
this, is the golden goat back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
golden goat back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making golden goat feminized
seeds for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell like hotcakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people, however, have requested
something different and they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: the fems, but they do want the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That inspired me to make the golden goat
back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I go about doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the original golden goat female,
so that's a good solid start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need to make a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat is what is known as a clone
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original breeder never put out seeds
of the golden goat, so the only plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: is available from that batch of seeds is
the one keeper clone of the golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what I have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to make seeds of the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is to find a male plant to
pollinate that golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to make some seeds to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: My approach was to find a male that was
drastically different in all ways from the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the golden goat had sharp, pointy,
serrated, skinny leaves and grew kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a tall yet compact structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's kind of redundant,
but when you see the plant and you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you'll understand it's a big plant,
but it stays compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can support itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice bud structure,
so I know the shape of that plant very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the skinnier, longer leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took another plant that was a male plant
and it had gigantic, wide, fat leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it grew real stretchy and real
branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush dominant, so I could see visually the
complete differences in these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went in the grow room and pulled a
leaf off of the golden goat and pulled a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf off of the daybreaker anywhere in the
room and brought them out, I could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you that's daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chose a daybreaker male that was
vastly different from the golden goat in
[SPEAKER_00]: every way, shape, and form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that daybreaker male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied that to the female golden goat
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have made it is kind of an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're just going to say that
that is an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what made Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that cross resulted the Arise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a golden goat female pollinated
by the daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male plant out of there that is
not King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a different male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male plant out of there that
very closely mirrors the original golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a male plant that is not golden
goat, pollinated the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male that looks identical,
if not a twin, if not a mirror of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original golden goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a male that looks just
like my golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now going to use that male to
pollinate my golden goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is now my original back cross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it a back cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I took that plant and I pollinated
something with it and I created seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took that seed and put it back on
the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have back crossed it to the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to do here, think about it
like ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, let's think of it as a dollar
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started with this dollar bill,
I tore it in half and I had 50 cents that
[SPEAKER_00]: were daybreaker and 50 cents that were
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that is 50 cents golden goat,
50 cents daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm going to put that back onto
the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got, let's say probably 75%,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put more golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to take out a quarter out of my
dollar, put more of the golden goat back
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 75% golden goat traits in that
first run of the back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're going to call back
cross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is labeled BX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Pete's head just exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be labeled BC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saying back cross you don't spell
cross with an X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the back cross because when we list
genetics, we like to put that X in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow it became a multiplication table,
but we like to put that X in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just saying, we often say like
golden goat cross two daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just saying back cross is what
the X represents BX back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I explained that generally how
the back cross one would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find a male plant that is vastly
different from your female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate, then you will make seeds from
those seeds, find a male plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: take the pollen from that male plant and
put it back on the original mommy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did this correctly, at least 75% of
your progeny should look very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next step is to take those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now taken, so you took your
daybreaker, pollinated golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you made seeds, you found a male that
looks just like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went so far as to pull the leaves off of
each plant and rest them up on top of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and count the serrations of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was rubbing the stems and smelling this
hand I was touching the female plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: this hand I was touching the male plants
and smelling for golden goat traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a mirror of the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that pollen, pollinated the
golden goat that made the first round of
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those seeds, I will find another male
that looks just like the golden goat again
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it back on that original golden
goat mommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point, we're just trying to
wash out the daybreaker traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: solidify that golden goat trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I do the back cross,
if I select my new male plants correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will get closer and closer to
stabilizing that golden goat trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be all golden goat the more we do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do it correctly, it's all about
selecting that male properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the female golden goat is
exactly what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduced the daybreaker on the first
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're trying to wash the daybreaker
out and all of the subsequent breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is BX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is going to be BX2 and so
forth every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to take the male plant,
pollinate, make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to take the seed and put
it back to the mom, then make more seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put that seed back to the mom and
that seed back to the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you do it, the back cross
number just goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get to the third,
fourth, at least hopefully by the fifth
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross, they should be quite stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the word
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people miss using the word
stable and stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stability when it comes to cannabis,
when it comes to breeding plants at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stability doesn't necessarily mean that
the plants have intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stability means that you're going to see
uniformity amongst a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we plant 100 seeds, stability means
that 100 of them are going to look quite
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat drag there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we plant 100 seeds, at least 75 to 80
to 90% of them, depending on which filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generation we are in, should look similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're talking about when it
comes to stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people say it hermed because it
wasn't stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was intersex and that intersex trait
could be stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make that a trait that pops up
if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't want to do that, but we are
using the word stable and stability quite
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes in the cannabis industry,
just trying to drop a little knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: nugget there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I explained back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose for back cross is we want to
make seeds of a plant which we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a male of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to pollinate the Golden
Goat with the Daybreaker, that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to find a seed of that
that looks like Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that to the Golden Goat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give us more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find one that looks like
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that Golden Goat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go as long as you want until those
plants look just like Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lifelong project to keep
going forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically how the back cross
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this question was what's the
difference between an F1 and an F2 and a
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: An F1 is if we were to use two
heterozygous plants, so Golden Goat and
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker, when we cross those,
that brand new cross, that thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: never been made before from two very
different parents, that is an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time we make that, that's an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made that F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we find a male and a female from that
seed batch and cross those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we make an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we find a male and a female from that
seed batch and make F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're brothers and sisters and
you're crossing them, you are making a
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is acceptable with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about the Golden Goat and
trying not to adulterate the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we pollinate the Golden Goat with the
Daybreaker, now we have adulterated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to back cross it to itself
again multiple times to wash out that
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to get rid of all the
traits, all the signs that Daybreaker was
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got as close to Golden Goat as
we can get without selfing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: without having a male to replicate it to
make the F2 or a further generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another reason why this is viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll find a seed in a bag of
weed and people always hope that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I find a seed in a bag of
weed, I hope that fucker's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a lot more things with a male
than I can a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only do one thing with the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can basically get pollinated by some
boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pollinate a bunch of females if I
find a boy and I can see what that male
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can create some new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've explained F1 a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've explained F2 a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I definitely explained back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my notes, see if I have
anything else left here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two heterozygous parents make an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called P1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents are P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross your F1s to make your F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a plant and create back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've made enough rambling at the
end of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're right at the Christmas taint,
the Christmas New Year's taint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't New Year's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to settle in for the New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody enjoyed this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clon, cutters, pollen,
chukers, all of you beautiful cannabis

[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody has a safe, happy New
Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will see you in 2022.
