[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to the point of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a talk about feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught you how to make your silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked more in depth about storing the
solution, more about application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did two full episodes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we should have made some seeds by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about harvesting
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be about
harvesting seeded cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't really matter if the seeds
are regular seeds, if they're FEM seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're auto flowers, if they're even
hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work for just about any sort of
cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are ready, if they're mature,
if they're ripe, this will be an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to everybody who asked me for
advice on harvesting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I personally harvest my seeded
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going for maximum seed harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want as many as I can get as many
healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I do is I start checking for the
ripeness of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just chop down a plant if
we don't know it's not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we would get a magnifying
glass and we would look at the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not concerned about the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes honestly do not matter at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I care about is the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the seeds ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I start pulling seeds out
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually around day 65 or 70, the plants
will be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about day 60, 65, I try not to get too
impatient, but I do pay attention to each
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just start pulling seeds out of the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get the top of the plant,
the middle of the plant and the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go for those obvious seeds that are
sticking up right at the edge of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for something kind of deeper into the
bud that's not protruding out,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you that it's almost ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a seed that you actually need to
investigate something that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all of the light, something that's
a little deeper into the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: something not prime, not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find the right seed, it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find a surprise seed, one in the
middle, one in a million and see what that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will pull the seed out of the nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just reach in there and you can feel
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's hard enough at this point,
you can feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just work its way out of the bud,
pull it out, get the casing or the hole or
[SPEAKER_00]: the shell, whatever you want to call that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that right off your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to visually inspect our seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What color is the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pale?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's still pale, if it's white and pale
or grayish, it is not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different kinds of gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a gray where it's not ready and a
gray when it's almost too done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's light colored, still soft and
squishy, obviously not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it starting to get some color to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it getting tiger striped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it getting green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it getting brown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it getting moldy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pay attention to all of the things
that could be happening to the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have potential of getting powdery
mildew, bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are still possible
when we're breeding for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pay attention, make sure we're
not getting anything on the seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pull the seeds out, see if
they're ripe, see what they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start feeling hard, I give them
what I call the pinch test.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start feeling hard is when it is
time to harvest, when most of the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: within that plant feel hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull a few out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll roll them on a hard wooden table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This table is fairly hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear me knock on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard, sturdy, solid table,
a table, a countertop, something that with
[SPEAKER_00]: no give.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would take the seeds and I'd
spread a bunch out on the table and press
[SPEAKER_00]: them with my pointer finger and just roll
them around, crush them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they crush, they're not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't crush, they're probably
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they super don't crush, you may have
gone too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let these seeds go too long,
they will get too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reach into the bud, pull out a few
seeds, roll them around, crush them,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they don't crush anymore,
when the majority of the seeds don't
[SPEAKER_00]: crush, it is time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be hard to achieve a point where
every seed in that plant is optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like trichomes, we want to go when
the majority of the plant is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want as many seeds as we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the seeds will not be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be overripe, but the majority
will be perfect if we take this plant down
[SPEAKER_00]: at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find out the seeds are hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out they're the right color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got their tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not crushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually chop down around day 70,
72 in an indoor flowering run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's if pollen happened around the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a previous episode to tell you about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chop when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it says here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop when ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I chop, I do a heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in and I pull out as many leaves as I
can possibly remove because this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to help speed up the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to help drastically speed up
the sorting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to sort through a bunch of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to turn this all into a
powdery dust eventually and get the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull off all the leaves that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate heavily before you cut the
plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after they're naked, I will cut them
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of different ways to do
this, depending on space, where I am,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I'm working with a bunch of
plants of one strain and all of the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in there are going to be the same seeds,
I will lay a tarp on the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some panda film on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I just used a big trash can lid
and let that catch any seeds that may fall
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just hang the plants from the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use either fishing line or one time I
was in a basement, I just used a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: little eye hooks and screwed them into the
basement ceiling, into the rafters down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hang the plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the plants hanging so that they're
going to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them hang too long because they
will get dry and seeds will begin to fall
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got plants, they will fit in
Rubbermaid tubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these Rubbermaid tubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're approximately, I'm going to guess
they're three feet long by two feet wide
[SPEAKER_00]: by 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lid on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not put the lid on them, but they do
come with the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll chop down the plant and
just put the entire plant right inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it sit right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really concerned about drying and
curing this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to be weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want seeds out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't put it in a beautiful
environment, a nice condition or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes wherever it can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it goes in the grow room in the
corner so that it gets warm and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need these plants to dry up
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cut them down, hang them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seeds start popping out,
then I'll drop them into that Tupperware
[SPEAKER_00]: container or that Rubbermaid or Sterlite
bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it a lot of different ways,
as long as your plants are isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more than one strain,
if you've got more than one female that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been pollinated, keep them separate so
you don't cross the seeds up and get those
[SPEAKER_00]: confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make very strong efforts to keep all of
my seeds separate because my seeds go out
[SPEAKER_00]: for commercial use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to get what they think
they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the packages to be labeled
correctly, and that takes effort from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get into their bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get dry, dry, dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: To speed up this drying process,
I will take the buds off of the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not super thick gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just thin leather gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I can do it barehanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the buds are just moist enough,
just dry enough, it'll work beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: barehanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the stick and just put your hand
around that stalk and just pull and knock
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds right off the stick into your
five gallon bucket, your Sterlite bin,
[SPEAKER_00]: your Rubbermaid tote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get those buds right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that stick in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to dry and cure anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not making smokable flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are after nothing but seeds at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of you out there may want to
make concentrates or edibles or something
[SPEAKER_00]: with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material that comes from the seeds,
I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am focused on strictly seed production,
seed movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about all the stuff that
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the material, the chaff is what I
think we call it, the junk, the trash that
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly goes in the compost pile or in
the Bokashi bucket, and it gets reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets turned back into minerals for
plant growth, for compost, goes out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: yard, gets the plants outside,
not the ganja plants, but the normal yard
[SPEAKER_00]: looks real good because of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I honestly beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beat up by the time I'm done that
there's any concentrates we've made with
[SPEAKER_00]: it come out green and funky and gross and
I don't make edibles myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not worth my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw it all away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pull the buds off the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a five gallon bucket or a tote
filled with just little tiny buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting drier by the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My reasoning is I want to get these seeds
dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get them out of these buds and I
want to get them packaged and get them out
[SPEAKER_00]: to either testers or vendors basically as
soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no good in them sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No product does you any good sitting in a
garage, sitting on a shelf, sitting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get this going as quickly as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get the sticks out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the buds as small as I can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally when I walk by, I'll just put
my hands in there and just break up those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds even smaller because smaller buds,
more surface area, they will dry more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a stir, mix up that stuff,
get the air out of there, get the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there, speed them up, get them dry,
dry, dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they are completely dry, this is what
happens when the fun begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it dry to where if it was weed,
you'd be mad that it got that dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But said this before, I'm not worried
about the weed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only worried about the beans,
which are inside of those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get it bone dusty dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll use a five gallon bucket
and I just put on gloves and it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: how much material there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just get in there with my fingers in
my hands and just do this move and just
[SPEAKER_00]: rub the buds and just grind it all up and
crush it up with my hands until it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: fine dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go hard enough to crush
or break or disrupt or rupture or destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the seeds that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the herb is so dry that I can just rub
it with my hands and it'll start crumbling
[SPEAKER_00]: up into dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the seeds land back into the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's raining into the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done it right, you get a bunch
of seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another method that I've seen people do
and somebody is going to say this is
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy, but I learned it from a crazy
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect to my buddy who showed me this
at the store at the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell what is called a paint paddle
for your drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a power drill and they put a
thing on there that is meant to stir
[SPEAKER_00]: paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a propeller for a boat or
something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's supposed to get down into the
bottom of a bucket of paint and stir it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you move it up and down and stir
your paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen somebody put that on a drill and
stick it in the five gallon bucket of buds
[SPEAKER_00]: with seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I took a couple of monster dabs
and it's got my throat choked up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we take the, uh, the paint stir,
put it on a medium low setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get in there and full on
like destroy the seeds, but like a medium
[SPEAKER_00]: low setting to where it's spinning and let
it hit the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the buds are dry enough,
they basically just crumble under that
[SPEAKER_00]: drill, under that flower bit under the
stir bit, it just crushes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad enough to destroy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we need to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put a drill bit in
there, if you're going to use something
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical, do not crush the seeds,
be gentle, be, uh, pay attention is the
[SPEAKER_00]: word I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main objective is to get it super
dry and then crumble it up into a dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: dusty mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a bunch of weed with a bunch of
seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a container with weed and
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to separate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the funnest part of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, this is almost the same as
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't have to trim because I just
turned all my weed into seeds and dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my version of trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then packaging seeds is also my
version of trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't complain about that, but this is the
next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to remove all the beans from all
of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, gravity will work for us for a
lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a, the right kind of
container, you can tip it to one side and
[SPEAKER_00]: most of your seeds will roll to the corner
that you've tipped it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've used a container that is tall
enough, wide enough, deep enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not, uh, if it's the right shape,
you may be able to reach in with your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull out most of the material and
leave all of the seeds at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help yourself out and just start scooping
it out the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most affordable and effective way of
course, is that old school way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get an album cover or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have no idea what I'm even
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a magazine, something flat and just
tip it up on one edge and let the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: run out and let that heavier material
stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tip something up and if you put the
seeds on a tray or a magazine or something
[SPEAKER_00]: and you tip it, the seeds will roll down
and the weed will stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that a couple of times and
clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the old school way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've made a lot of seeds,
that will drive you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I possibly could never do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never ever finish sorting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a flower sifter from your
local grocery store or the mart down the
[SPEAKER_00]: street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a sifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a net with a plastic ring
around it and a handle, but it's a mesh
[SPEAKER_00]: net, a metal net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw the material and the seeds in
there and gently rub it around over
[SPEAKER_00]: another bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material will fall out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds will remain in the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your seeds that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, wear some rubber gloves because your
fingers are going to get all chafed and
[SPEAKER_00]: all funky from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a frustrating process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of seeds that will
get her done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of seeds, this is when
the job does get harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen, uh, shout out to Masonic
Smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen this method in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't the first one that I saw do it,
but I forgot all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mace took a container that had urban
seeds in it and he just gingerly turned on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shop vac and just kind of feathered
the top of the, the weed and the material
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulled out the weed and just kind of
gingerly tipped it around and moved it
[SPEAKER_00]: toward none of the seeds were getting
sucked up, but the weed was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got most of it out that way,
then went back, just kind of hand clean
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a super easy way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way to do it is a seed sorting
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are numerous seed sorting machines
available on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite is the small device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a white shoe box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got two drawers on the front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pour in the material, the fucking
seeds come out on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material comes out on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking magic inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another one that is much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hooks up to a shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making a bunch of seeds,
that one is effective for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's overkill for me and I make a lot of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes up a lot of space and you
need the shop vac also, uh, the little
[SPEAKER_00]: white square piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a standalone unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a computer fan in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part about both of those seed
separating devices is there are very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple blueprints and plans all over the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need a seed sorting machine,
there are blueprints, plans, guides all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my friend Cascadian grown for a
while was making seed sorting machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do approve of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are quality devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Cascadian grown on the social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're in the weed scene,
the cannabis crew, you know how to find
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new, uh, follow my social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know you need to find Cascadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, don't know if he's still making
them, but he's a good dude and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a plug if I've got an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he would give me a plug if he had
the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what family does.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely make your own seed
sorting machine, uh, sorting seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, counting seeds, sorting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that I would
recommend is buy yourself a seed counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're about 350 to 450.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 bucks, depending on the quality,
uh, that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course how quickly you get it
shipped, uh, find one that'll ship it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spending that much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a seed counter is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love just putting the seeds in the seed
counter and watching it Turner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love watching the seed spin up a little
thing and into the shoot and show me how
[SPEAKER_00]: many seeds I've got so much better than
guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once you've done it, a lot of times
you'll get a good guess, but it's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: better than I can do inventory like this
beep and they go, and then it tells me how
[SPEAKER_00]: many seeds are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so get yourself a seed sorting machine
or get yourself a, um, a sifter or an
[SPEAKER_00]: album cover or some way to get the seeds
out, have a strategy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you don't destroy that weed so
badly by using the sorting machine and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit that I do to it, you may be able
to make something out of that leftover
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never intend to, I never plan to,
uh, I just straight up pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, destroy the whole plant,
get all the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, uh, since I have a seed company,
I guess I just use the funding from the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates in the edibles,
which I would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my strategy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let it get real dry, crumble it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once it's crumbled up, that's when
you've got some decisions to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use the sifter or how are
you going to crumble it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use a drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use your gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people put it in a baggie and
just stomp on the baggie a lot or mash the
[SPEAKER_00]: baggie with their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you get that weed real dry,
it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, uh, figure out how you're going to
get the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use the sifter,
the machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use a vacuum, get those
seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're going to use the seed
sorting machines, maybe a mask because it
[SPEAKER_00]: blows a lot of dust around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do get the green boogers from that,
which are never pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the seeds are out of the material,
label them, whatever baggie jar,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it goes into, make sure that gets
labeled properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to label it with the male plant was
the female plant was what the cross is
[SPEAKER_00]: called and the date of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I kind of have an idea how old
those seeds are when they came out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's me know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if there's a problem, I know that it
came from this batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just helps me out with a little bit
of, uh, just helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then the best part grow the seeds,
grow these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've made some cool seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them out of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to grow them before you
sell them, share them, pass them along,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them, make sure you didn't just make
total garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't ask for money for seeds that you
haven't tested because who knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it could be all boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be all intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be mutants or, or maybe you just
made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new hottest fire on the market,
store your seeds in a cool, dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now they should be super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow my method, the seeds are
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to be stored, but make sure
they're nice and dry before you do seal
[SPEAKER_00]: them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you do risk the opportunity for
mold and pathogens in your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them go, let them get nice and dry,
then label them correctly and store them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that does wrap up my seed harvest
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you have any more questions about
harvesting seeds, maybe we should talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about seed storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storage may be an upcoming episode because
that seems like the next logical step.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
