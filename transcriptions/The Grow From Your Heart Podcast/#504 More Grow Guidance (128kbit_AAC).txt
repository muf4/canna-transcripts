[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 504 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our only official sponsor, Seeds Here
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new, regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition to start the
podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of lemon wreath live
batter from my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of chem brulee and secret
kush mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
lemon rind and tea tree oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a little bit of funk in
there that I cannot quite describe,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will give it lemon rind and tea tree
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those flavors are absolutely present.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor just lingers on your tongue
when you hit this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it does say
the product contains 66.7% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hit this stuff, I get a really nice
tunnel visiony, chattery, rambly sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this will make great podcast
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious lemon wreath live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to read a couple of listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails before we get to that portion of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some shout outs to a few of our
friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big giant grow from

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to feel like a pledge drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I love answering
grow questions from my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me an email and you ask me a
cultivation or a cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: question, I will do my best to read and
answer your question on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me all of your cannabis
cultivation and culture questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in today's episode goes a
lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Dear Rasta Jeff, I have a
question, but first I would like to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you why I enjoy listening to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you speak well and are well
spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to speak clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get going way too fast for my own good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes my brain travels much more
quickly than my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep that under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to control my face and make the
right sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say regardless of how much
knowledge someone may have, I cannot stand
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen to poor speakers or poor quality
audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody calls in on a podcast and I
can tell they're on the phone or if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're calling in on a shitty Skype
connection and there's a long delay or if
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like this and they're talking
from the phone behind the microphone,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't fucking stand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not listen to that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think quality audio is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off in the music scene and the
music industry before I wanted to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had another friend who was
doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me to be a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually refused to be a guest on
his show unless he allowed me to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the episode on which I appeared because
until then his show did not sound up to my
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of equipment from the time I
spent recording and producing and
[SPEAKER_00]: participating in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to play drums on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of music stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fancy toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told my buddy, come to my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do your show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really good at recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that podcast sound good in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a lot of practice and I've
come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer to that is I agree
with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to listen to a poor quality
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody that doesn't speak well is
even harder for me to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that lemon wreath dab got me
fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to focus for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you are very knowledgeable and
you present it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the time to plan and lay out the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people probably don't realize
that it takes a little bit of time and
[SPEAKER_00]: effort to actually create a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideas have to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody didn't send me an email to
prompt my brain, I don't have a subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to invent a topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to make an outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got to record it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course I edit it and I put it up
on all the servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a little bit of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that I do take a
little bit of time out of my life,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of my day to actually lay out the
podcast, to make it something that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for many different listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be able to learn from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like I'm hitting my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep moving because there is a lot
more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you are funny, which makes
listening entertaining as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to school, I loved learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hated sitting there being bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like I was being lectured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of my teachers did not have any
flavor or style to their teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically opened up a curriculum book
and shot it at us and we were supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a few teachers who would take
their time and actually learn their
[SPEAKER_00]: students and figure out how we learn best
and find the obstacles we're experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: and help us get over those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few very wonderful teachers,
but unfortunately that was not the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I was bored in school or
frustrated in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I learned things rather
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when everybody else was catching on,
I was finding a way to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hated being in school, but I love
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had entertaining teachers or
teachers that took a moment to connect,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really excelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like if I sneak a couple of
jokes or say something a little bit silly
[SPEAKER_00]: just to keep your attention going and kind
of it's like throwing you a treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had all this learning that here's a
little snack for your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes learning fun and you want to do
it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to be fucking lectured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep it a little bit fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it keeps your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can learn some stuff and have
a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate that you think I'm
funny, but do not encourage me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need encouragement to be the class
clown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the words of
encouragement, but let's move to the
[SPEAKER_00]: question part of this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to your series of grow lessons,
which were very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In episode 73, you discuss a perpetual
grow where you are harvesting one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I like this idea, but how do you
deal with the light being further or
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to the plants since they are all
different heights?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this listener is listening to episode
73 where I did discuss creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual harvest in a small environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe it was in a five by five tent
under one light where you've got four
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon pots flowering at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that perpetual scenario, you would
harvest a seven gallon pot every two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and replace it with a fresh seven gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this person does raise a very
interesting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask, what do you do with that brand
new pot that is much smaller and much
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter than the plants that have been in
their for two, four, six, and eight weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is at the top of the tent
because you've got many plants that have
[SPEAKER_00]: grown really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do with this shorter plant that
hasn't had time to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the situation I was talking about,
the light is not movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light needs to remain at the very top
of the tent because we've got plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are fully mature in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light cannot be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we've got to work from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't move the light down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have either got to move the floor up
or figure out a way to raise the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's raise the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very common way to lift plants up off
the ground is to get another pot the same
[SPEAKER_00]: size as the pot you're using and simply
flip it upside down, use it as a table,
[SPEAKER_00]: and set the pot right on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a seven gallon pot is probably going
to lift you up somewhere between 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 16, maybe even 18 inches, just depending
on the depth and diameter of the seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot you've chosen to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to raise your plant up at
least 12, maybe even 14, 16, maybe 18
[SPEAKER_00]: inches, and that should be sufficient
because that plant is going to begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow rapidly and it's only going to be the
smallest plant in the room for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully after two weeks you can take
that one off the pot, set it on the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next one that comes in can go on
that inverted pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very easy, affordable,
and safe way to raise your new plant up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit higher and get it closer to the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, you've got one
seven gallon pot upside down that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, we'll say 16 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got another seven gallon pot on top
of that, that's another 16 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, we are getting close to
three feet off the ground before we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: any plant coming out of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a tent, you've probably only
got six and a half, maybe seven feet worth
[SPEAKER_00]: of vertical height minus your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're already getting that plant
plenty close to the light, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very affordable and very
effective way to raise your plant about 16
[SPEAKER_00]: inches and get it closer to the light,
get it up there to the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that you want to get that
light to all of your plants, but you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a little bit of a difference
that you cannot fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those big budded plants are going to get
more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your smaller plants are going to get less
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that five by five tent, if you've got a
600 or a thousand watt light, you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping out enough light throughout that
tiny reflective space where all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants should get enough light to be
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you feel like you may need to
defoliate or move some branches over a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain way, don't be afraid to defoliate
strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to bottom and lollipop
strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a leaf is blocking a bud site,
feel free to take it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you'll learn how to snap and
pop the stems and just move them the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you need them right out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to shape and structure your
plants the way you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk more about shaping and
structuring our plants in a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's wrap up this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks keep up the great podcast
from your friend Rodney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rodney, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do run that perpetual grow,
I would love to see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions or if you need
more help, please send me a follow up
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another email right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if they want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Trent and
it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm a long time
listener and I've learned a lot from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for listening and I'm glad
you were learning from the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I greatly appreciate
all of the info you give to our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one question I was hoping you
could help me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started to flower in my tent and
I'm looking into what I want to grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: my winter run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to grow something from
your line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, but I want to make sure my
environment is right for the seeds I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is very smart of you to have
some forethought to make sure you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate seeds for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people just see some seeds,
they see a strain, they see some hype,
[SPEAKER_00]: they spend their money, they get the
seeds, they try to grow it and they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and they go, this does not work for what I
thought I was going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really proud of you for thinking
about this in advance and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching out to the guy who makes the
seeds to get some guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really smart of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish everybody had the foresight you
were using now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm in a four by four
tent with a 260 watt quantum board and a
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid LED Gromow 5 V3 two by two do it
yourself kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, most of that is abbreviated and
I'm kind of proud of myself for nailing
[SPEAKER_00]: that on the first try, or at least I think
I got it on the first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend Trent is growing in a four
by four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got two LED lights in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know about those two
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much light that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to act like that's enough
light for the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say my tent is exhausted to
another part of my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to move the humidity and
heat away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got a carbon filter in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says I grow in an amended soil mix
of cocoa, perlite, worm castings and a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: of super soil and ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a great mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I don't use nutrients until flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all that stuff you've got in there,
I think that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got amended soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the amendments, but it sounds
like you probably put a lot in there
[SPEAKER_00]: because you got cocoa, perlite,
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the bag of super soil will get you
through there and the ocean forest will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No nutrients until flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a better performance out of
the veg plants if you added a few things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if it's working for you, keep doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says I use nectar of the gods
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It focuses its regimen with a pH between
six one and six five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also focuses on using calcium as the
main source of everything through veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: through flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with how that line is
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that it is quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some great outcomes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any details about how they
make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you know enough and it's
quality for you, so keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says there is 52 inches from my soil to
my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I use scrog nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow some semi-longer growing
things with that much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: 52 inches from the soil to the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just over four feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without those scrog nets, you're going
to have to flip something about a foot and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half, two feet tall, which is not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top it once, you can get a nice
bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're using that scrog net like you
talk about, maybe let it grow about a
[SPEAKER_00]: third, maybe halfway up and then flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it go too tall because you will
start getting close to the lights if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using one of my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's keep talking more about your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my temps at night are 76 degrees
and 84 degrees during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can control the humidity with my
humidifier and dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping with all of this information,
maybe we could figure out a strain to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested in doing a bit of
phenohunting to narrow down to the best
[SPEAKER_00]: four to grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would probably need like a five to 10
pack and I would prefer fems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear from you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your friend Trent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Trent, it sounds like you've
got a pretty nice environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have too much of a day and night
swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only major limiting factor here is
that 52 inches from the soil to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not much space for the way I like
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you have figured it out by
using these scrog nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were looking for recommendations from
my line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also indicated that you would prefer
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk briefly about some things I
would suggest for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with feminized
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to recommend a couple of
feminized seeds for your space,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start off with the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think orangegasm would work very well in
your space because it is a shorter and
[SPEAKER_00]: squattier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a lot of height,
so you do need a plant that doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: too tall and orangegasm will fit that
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also will finish a little bit earlier,
so you don't have to worry about it
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching for that extra week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another feminized seed I would recommend
for your grow is the Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo is quite similar to the sun
kiss because it has that same platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy female plant in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is the orangegasm is made
with a golden goat reversed female and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo is made with a blueberry
cookies reversed female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those are feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are going to offer very
orange candy dominant turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun kiss is going to be more orange
and possibly grapefruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Michelangelo is going to be oranges
and some sort of candy and skittly type
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those strains are both very forgiving and
very easy to grow and I think they would
[SPEAKER_00]: work very well in your temperatures and
with your nutrient mix and in your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another feminized cross that I think may
work well for you is the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are able to scrog it properly,
the golden goat will perform very well in
[SPEAKER_00]: that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love golden goat in a commercial setting
because it reacts very well to being
[SPEAKER_00]: netted down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of branches and it loves
that type of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the description of your room,
you said the room hits 84 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you may have a possible spike
of 85 or 86 on occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat will handle temperature
spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not get mad at you if it gets a
little bit hot in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the golden goat may work for that high
temperature environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also indicated that this would be your
winter run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you'll be able to push it and
keep it nice and cool in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just in case that golden goat,
if it grows too close to the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be able to tolerate those higher
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the three that I would
recommend if you want to stick with
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds from my line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the lemon Jeffrey may get too
tall on you in that space if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: scrog it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it does get a little bit long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get a little bit of space
between your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be ideal for the scrog
environment with such a low type of
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer two or three layers of
scrog nets for the lemon Jeffrey because
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going to get long really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think you would have great
success with golden goat feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would have great success with
sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think you would have great
success with Michelangelo seeds in that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a few things you
could do if you don't want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one recommendation from my line
I would suggest if you're going to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: the regular seed would be prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana stays nice and short, nice and
squat, nice and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spread it out real far and she
doesn't mind being stretched and scrogged
[SPEAKER_00]: and trained out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll actually respond very well to that
type of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana actually finishes quite early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a phenotype that finishes at
the end of week seven, maybe at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longest they should go is nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think prana would work beautifully in
your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also recommend morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew likes to be scrogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew likes to be stretched out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will produce big fat chunky buds,
but they won't get super tall and stretchy
[SPEAKER_00]: on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will work very well in that scrog
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend with most of my strains,
if you're going to do a scrog in that 52
[SPEAKER_00]: inch space, I would put the first net
about a third of the way down and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: that next net probably halfway or maybe a
little bit higher up than halfway so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see two layers of scrog
net in that environment if that's at all
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is a spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one acts as a support and then
try to fill that entire environment with
[SPEAKER_00]: giant chunky colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my third recommendation for your
environment if we are not going to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed would be sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun kiss is the platinum tangy to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does like to stay nice and short and
squat and it puts on that wonderful orange
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very similar to the orange gasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very similar to the Michelangelo
because it's got that platinum tangy mom
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell I really enjoy breeding to
the platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Maddie and Spence from
the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the ones who made the platinum
tangy that I love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that plant makes short, squat,
bushy offspring and it is very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I work with it so much and
that's why I recommend it so much for this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to run regular seeds I
would recommend the prana, the morning dew
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a super experienced grower
and you want a really easy grow I would go
[SPEAKER_00]: with one of those fem lines and I would go
with one of the orange dominant ones
[SPEAKER_00]: either the Michelangelo or the orange
gasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run regular seeds and you
want a really easy grow I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an experienced grower I would
recommend maybe trying that golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go with regular seeds then
you can try the prana or maybe the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: dew or maybe the sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morning dew is probably going to be
the most challenging plant out of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun kiss and the morning dew should be
quite easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you now that if you grow the
prana or the morning dew in that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment be prepared to do some
defoliation because both of those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: get quite large leaves and you'll want to
pull off some of those big hand sized
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves to keep the airflow and the light
penetration optimal in your tight space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright Trent I want to thank you for the
great email.

tent grow.
