[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 205 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast,
your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: me use their music on Mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you were flying around in your
little mental rocket ship for a moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: circling yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe 15 minutes before we hit
record, I took the biggest dab I've taken
[SPEAKER_01]: in two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: In two months?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a good tolerance break in there,
and there was some pure THCA crystallite
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkled over the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in just a
couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's doing some fun things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Describe the fun things it's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right now I seem pretty lucid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel pretty lucid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a minute ago, I was tuned out just
contemplating the taste of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does blue taste like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pepper, mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue tastes like Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll give you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's sparking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dye number two, and then my head's
just kind of spiraled, and I, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: contemplating the taste of color,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shall do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you enjoy the flavor of
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue tastes like Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that because there are two Dr. Pepper
bottles that are frosty cool?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, it's right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just good and baked, folks,
and we're really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that green tastes like
Mountain Dew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure green tastes like Mountain
Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the first thing I would
assume green tastes like is Surge or
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from a certain generation,
you'll remember Surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Green Otter Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Otter Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything sour apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're way on a tangent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike just went out and enjoyed the
beautiful sounds of a high-speed chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sounds of Pueblo, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's someone on a crotch rocket's
having a very uncomfortable conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: right about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they probably got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sounds that I heard here in the house,
they got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not stop for that cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're long gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several officers involved from
the sounds of things by the time I came
[SPEAKER_01]: back inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a gas station right by my house,
and a lot of the guys on the motorcycles
[SPEAKER_00]: like to gather there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure one of them was going to
there when they got stopped by that cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I got outside, maybe 30 seconds
later, I heard somebody on a crotch rocket
[SPEAKER_01]: take off a couple streets over.
[SPEAKER_01]: In about 30 seconds into the crotch rocket
making a hell of a lot of noise late at
[SPEAKER_01]: night, a cop joined the sounds of the
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I came back inside,
several officers had joined the hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's having a bad night or telling a
fun story with a lot of adrenaline pumping
[SPEAKER_01]: through them at home right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they're going to go to jail
or get a ticket?
[SPEAKER_01]: That depends on so many things that I did
not hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful high-speed chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Pueblo, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 10 o'clock on a Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there just revving it up,
getting pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice night too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of shenanigans going on tonight,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple things that I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike just told me that he thinks this show
is closer to four years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about this a couple days
ago listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kid's pushing two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is going the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife was pregnant with the kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a significant amount of time before
that, I was going back listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one of the first episodes, you and Kev
go to a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to have been a medical only cup,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we figure out how old the show
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We figure out which cannabis cup the two
of you went to that time because you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: went to a couple of them in a couple of
the first cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did in Colorado were medical only
long before recreational passed in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help me out because my
computer was tripping just a second ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure we're properly
recording here.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I'm going to make sure
I'm going to go open up iTunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: FileZilla because I've got the original
files in iTunes and FileZilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just check the born on date?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are dates on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say file created.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get official and figure out
how old the show is tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're doing it, we're probably going
to take a dab so we'll come back and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: More dabs seem like an appropriate idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell you the truth, I took some dabs of
the same stuff Mike was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a much larger version and I kind of
drifted away as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that oh fuck moment for a minute
when you're like, I might be a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: high than I had planned on being for the
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be a really late recording
session because we've got to take an hour
[SPEAKER_01]: beforehand to tone it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put ourselves in another dab coma
and let's make sure this file is recording
[SPEAKER_00]: properly because I'm not certain that the
first 30 seconds worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something was weird and also we're going
to check the born on date of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if everything went
well, we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too bad I didn't hit it until right after
you said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike got to bring the show back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do that at the start of the show,
but thanks for coming and hanging out with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so overwhelmed by you saying that
you were sitting there tasting the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sentences stop rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, sometimes you shouldn't say some
shit out loud, but thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the research we're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we solved the mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mystery, the magical mystery has been
solved before we tell you how long the
[SPEAKER_00]: show has actually been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's remind people how to stalk you
on all of the social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we skipped that at the start of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can find me on a Twitter at Nemo
punk 15 or on Facebook at Pueblo for
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, find out where that handsome voice is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and also shout out to Jen and little
Davey for letting you come hang out with
[SPEAKER_00]: me for a little while and record a podcast
and get, thanks for holding down the fort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get way too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was Marvel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm kind of back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did take a couple of little smaller
grounding dabs cause we didn't dip them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it helped out a lot that THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about it in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll talk more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really something beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's obviously working still.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pressed pause for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're going to check out social
media, why not follow me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can check me out on,
um, go to Twitter it's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to email me, send me an email
grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, uh, went and checked out the file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode number one was put into my iTunes
folder, uh, on March 24th of 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike had to sit here and count his fingers
several times to figure out how old that
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was trying to include the year 2014 as
another year that starts zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got 14 is zero then 15,
16, 17 were three years and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a triple check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really right here where it says four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to X that out for you on my
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doink, doink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to write three with a
star and circle the star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just over three years, just over three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy third birthday to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, three years out of those three
years, bro, how many podcasts do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been on?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many episodes?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're over 200 total now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shit, 75 to 125 somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good, good safe range to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's agent near math right there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ballparking the fuck out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, I'd say a good 75, maybe a
hundred episodes, maybe half of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause in the beginning I had you here a
lot more now Mike's schedule fucking is
[SPEAKER_00]: our schedules don't line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your schedule is definitely more sporadic
than mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've got a kid that's almost two,
like you can plan all you fucking want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but every now and then like the kid throws
up on everything and you don't get to go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 37 dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They add up to 37 normal dogs easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But three Malamute, so they shut off like
two smaller dogs a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sweater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot to keep on top of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, when you call Mike,
you're like, Hey bro, do you want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, your car or mine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you say your car, he's like,
I got a defer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be an extra 15 minutes before I'm
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have to do like a 15 minute
process to leave the house without like
[SPEAKER_01]: taking most of a dog with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first met you, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, defer, what's this guy got
going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the first time I went to your
house, I was like, Oh, there's those three
[SPEAKER_00]: Savage wolves in the front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to Disney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone in the Northern hemisphere is
terrified of my dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live in Pueblo where we just had a
high speed, I want to say a car chase with
[SPEAKER_00]: a damn motorcycle chase and shit goes on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need scary dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're way off topic, but this podcast is
three years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just looped it right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my arms up in the air and nobody on
the show can see me throw my arms up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air in celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm rocky or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't we talk about recording this on our
video and decided not to?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided it'd be much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making videos of the pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just said it dude video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make videos of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have only got the first few
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch the first 25 right now
they're on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it sucks up my computer for the time
it takes to make the video plus like three
[SPEAKER_00]: times as long to upload it to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I don't know if you wanted to
share this with the listeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to go ahead and add you a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, while we're talking about the show
hitting its third birthday, we filled up
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mac book and had to go back and delete
a bunch of files so that we could continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to record this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was why it was acting funny earlier,
ladies and gentlemen, because yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was full.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had, but usually I took three years,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I record a bunch of stuff and then
I put them up to wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, it goes to my iTunes and then I
back my iTunes up to my terabyte hard
[SPEAKER_00]: drive here, my little secondary drive,
but I just haven't deleted like episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: one through two hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the computer was like, bro,
you got all these garage band files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are three hours long because
of those, those throwback episodes I do on
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, also I've got a star right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday episode was delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you just came out late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, where's the episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been messing with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've been my upload system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take accountability and say
that she wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's been fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a Thursday episode that came
out Friday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assumed it was stitcher because several
podcasts I listened to all came out a day
[SPEAKER_01]: late.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then maybe that wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one episode that's completely
missing from stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've emailed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yo, where's my episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they replied and said they're on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently they fell off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should email them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just trying to be polite and let them
fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they're within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been probably 48 hours since I
messaged them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should get back on them and get their
shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I apologize that 30 Thursday episode
didn't come out properly like it should
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're rambling off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to blame it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what we're talking about,
you know what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to blame half our rambles on
our friends at apothecary in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than half 99% of my rambles tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to put 1% into that Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% these rambles are brought to you by
our friends at apothecary extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sponsor the show or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new, uh, dispensary in Colorado
Springs at 3049 Delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medical marijuana only facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if they had flowers in
that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is just a hash store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's full on concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes all kinds to make the world
go around and I'm down with an all hash
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it's an amazing, the concentrate
selection in that place is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've got, I've got to reach over to my
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike, say something about hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the selection we've got on the table,
people make, uh, pretty much all of you
[SPEAKER_01]: cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start get legalization going in
your state so that you can enjoy this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just start with this little pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only complaint I have, I am completely
satisfied with this, but they label these
[SPEAKER_00]: little envelope packages that it comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: These child proof packages, these are
labeled, but when you take them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these glass jars are not labeled and
I've got a, obviously a backgammon stack
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seven or eight of these stacked
up for civilians.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a mild inconvenience for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it presents a significant logistics
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to write on them with a marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, so they call, they've got a few
products we're going to talk about and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not just pitching a apothecary products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have to sound like an apothecary
fucking ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and bought these products with cash
out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid a pretty penny for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so fucking excited about it that
I want to share it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of new things in here
that I've never purchased before that
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's never seen before, uh, that we
smoked that's brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of just wanted to share the
brand new shit with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the hash market exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I was thinking about this the
other night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that long ago that hash was
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, remember when we started smoking dabs
and we would get stuff that was as black
[SPEAKER_00]: as my iPhone case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, we got some shattered
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd heat up the skillet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that skillet heat that fucker up
until it glowed bright orange is glowed a
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glow is I think so, but we're going to
glowed it glowing and past tense is
[SPEAKER_01]: glowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that bitch glowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we threw shout as my buddy James
at the grow and then we would throw just
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks of this terrible black shatter on
it and just smoke it until our lungs would
[SPEAKER_00]: cave in and we'd cough and we'd be so
proud of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, uh, the little metal brick with the
vial on the end with the alcohol hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere that was raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that thing called the eclipse?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the brand name,
but it was, it looked like an aluminum
[SPEAKER_01]: brick with a glass vial that screwed into
one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was the eclipse and it would make
you puke if you hit the vial lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get the hash vaping off the heat of
the glass and then just inhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing hit like a dump truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like getting ran over by a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sometimes you'd get a number of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw someone throw up off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't that long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if, if the show started in 2014,
that was 2013, 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at, we were at metamar at that
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was seven or six or eight years
ago, somewhere in that time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've gone from smoking black ass
oil that looked like my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the best stuff on the market
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were happy to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were lucky to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were heating it so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, now, now we let the nail cool a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you drop the dab on a carb cap
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's so much better on your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't feel like you're going to die
every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think I rubbed the label off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what flavor this is anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Oh, that we're going to save that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that one in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has some really cool branding going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to talk about is their
branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they make a product that they call
Ambrosia and I don't want to discredit
[SPEAKER_00]: their Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambrosia is basically live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just what they're calling it because
live resin is technically a marketing term
[SPEAKER_00]: owned by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's should describe a very specific
extraction technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a whopper and a Big Mac next to
each other, they're both pieces of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using a very easy example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you put a whopper and a Big Mac
next to each other, those, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: are both cheeseburgers that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say that, but you cannot call the
whopper a Big Mac and you cannot call a
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mac a whopper because they are
proprietary products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you went to the one place and asked
for one, they tell you to go fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of, that's kind of how
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even straight get Pepsi products
in the place they make Coke in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like branding is important everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we're getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, the people that made live resin,
they called it live resin first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a while they tried to keep it
their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, people like us saw that fight
because it's important to some people in
[SPEAKER_01]: our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important to the guy that
patented that technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, one of, they've got a product,
they call it Ambrosia and it's their
[SPEAKER_00]: version of live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had picked out my, or they showed me a
few things on the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, here's what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this product, there's this
product, uh, and they're going really
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying, cause there's a lot of
customers in that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day it's their brand new,
it's their opening over at apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I was checking everything out and
I had made my decisions and they go,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we just put this in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're running out of stuff and
checking new stuff into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go into their computer system
before they can sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they go smell this and see what
you think they got from where I am to you
[SPEAKER_00]: with the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could probably, you're starting to
smell it probably from where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so aromatic that I was like,
yeah, I'll take a gram of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care what it cost, what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, put that in my bag,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to take it home and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is blue tie ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna have to put it down cause
I'm sweating off the fucking label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's the only flaw in this stuff is
the labels are, they're not labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you take them out, the stuff is
really slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got their own containers that are
all labeled up with their, their logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, everything looks slick, but when
you've got 12 of them laid out on a,
[SPEAKER_01]: on an oil slick pad in front of you,
they're all identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of an issue for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you dab and you get a
little bit sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause after a couple of dabs, my fingers
get butter fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is, so I've got star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of the star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to, I was going to try to
describe the smell of that blue tie,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's undescribable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's got almost a mint,
the latum smell, but it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a fruity smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're familiar with the smell
of a good haze, it smells like a good
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, which is the tie, the tie weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives it that haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume the star dog was really
something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was part of the dab that ruined me a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I wouldn't call the star dog gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just smells like gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's straight out of a very feely smell to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a little bit of, like if you
spilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I can smell that one from here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spilled a little bit of diesel fuel
on a bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get some Fox farms in the car and
then you got gas, that's what it would
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get in the live resin side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what I've got for their
ambrosia products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple that I haven't even
opened yet that I don't want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I do this thing where I open them
all and take two dabs out of each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got a whole bunch of half
smoked hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, I don't know how much
hash I even have at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is, uh, and I'm just trying to
work up to the grand finale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to read that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one over here, this one will make
some people drool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry cheesecake batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll smell it as soon as I open it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just change the smell in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like from this angle in that
container, it looks like a piece of chewed
[SPEAKER_00]: up white gum is what it looks like from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like if you, if you've ever made
chocolate, like tollhouse chocolate chip
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies before you drop in the chocolate
chips, it's almost this color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's why they're calling it batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it smells like, yeah, the consistency
kind of looks like a thick cookie batter
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some terpadelic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't opened this other one that I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making my mouth water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive adult candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set that one over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to keep myself a little
organized here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I haven't opened this one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, uh, it's called, it's right here,
strawberry banana HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about HCFSE in just a
minute, but strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like what you would expect
strawberry banana to smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here we've got is probably,
this is mob boss HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some of the Stardog HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice body height to it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just got a message on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, Hey, do you really need to know
more information about HTFSE as I was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are mentally broadcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, so HCFSE, I'm just going to tell
everybody what it stands for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about it again in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is high cannabinoid, full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it may be one of my favorite
types of concentrates or extracts to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: on is really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave me a nice, super pleasing
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you've gotten to try that
one yet, Mike, but I'll give you some in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which I mean, some of that matters to
some, it doesn't matter to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the grand finale in my shopping
spree that I went on was, uh, I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some THCA crystalline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just crystallized THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks almost like salt or sugar in a
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like heaven in a little glass
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave Mike a dab of the Stardog Ambrosia
with a little piece of the Stardog HCFSE
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I dipped that in a little tiny
bit of the THCA and Mike was over here
[SPEAKER_00]: contemplating the flavor of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was, you know, that gaze that your
friends have when you're, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you staring all the way down the block
or are you not even in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was looking through the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was just lost in La La Land.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a couple of fun places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall body of effect from that all
three combined was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THCA just makes me skyrocket,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I used to say that the terpenes make
me skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THCA does it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, kind of like the first time
you had a Red Bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the level of pick me up was
significantly stronger than I was
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I've noticed with the THCA
is there's no limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can't, normally if I'm smoking dabs
or whatever I'm smoking, I can get to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where, how high I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go past whatever number that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go past there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm smoking the THCA, I can get to
another thing that I don't get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's my belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a Scientologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the other cannabinoids that
come along, Mike's trying to laugh off the
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientologist back to back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that was a stone or
stumble or just beautiful and eloquent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't do Scientology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't a Scientomologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't hold the two, two metal levers
and give all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your money to Tom Cruise.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I will not give all my money to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, no, I don't want to buy any real
estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like, uh, the, I feel like all
of the other cannabinoids that come with
[SPEAKER_00]: it and possibly the terpenes and whatever
else are involved in smoking a flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some of those, uh,
create like a funnel for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to get into my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of it slows it down and
allows me to only get what I need or what
[SPEAKER_00]: it can handle at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the THCA by itself,
you're not getting the regulators that
[SPEAKER_00]: would come along with it, whatever,
however it would balance itself out as the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the cleanest form of THC the way,
or at least once it hits your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I can get, I, and all those other
pieces definitely influence the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so stripping those away, you're
getting just the THC effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost, I can get really high
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys, I'm not trying to talk any
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be the champ or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke two grams of shatter every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a nice amount of hash
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a normal day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smoke two grams of shatter on
Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke this THCA and I can put myself
uncomfortably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a new dabber, for somebody that
doesn't smoke every day, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably get themselves into an
uncomfortable position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just smoking the THCA by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true with a lot of the products
that are legal in medical markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I was, I get sucked into weird
places online when I'm baked and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: reading dispensary reviews from a shop
that just happens to be near my mom's
[SPEAKER_01]: place, um, on weed maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now one of the reviews mentioned,
I'm glad the other budtender said
[SPEAKER_01]: something because I didn't know shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person I was talking to first,
who just happened to be the first
[SPEAKER_01]: salesperson I talked to was pointing out
hash and I haven't smoked weed in 40 years
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would have ruined me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other budtender was, caught onto
my level of, uh, inexperience and said
[SPEAKER_01]: something and got me something I did
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reading that review kind of took me
out of my head for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, there's a lot of,
I would think of them as civilians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not entirely sure why,
but, uh, just people who aren't used to
[SPEAKER_01]: this level of, uh, THC in a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've got a friend whose,
uh, son just got married.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to out them on the show
because I respect the privacy but shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my friend who just got married to
his beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had family come from two ends of the
country, uh, to meet here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were super excited about
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you and I messaged back and
forth about suggestions on ways to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: their smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're coming to Colorado,
the safest thing we've established to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is get yourself an Airbnb and stay there
because it's not a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as the people allow you to
smoke, you can smoke there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of Airbnb places that
advertise as smoker friendly or 420
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, those folks that came from other
places, it was like, dude, they were so
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to be here and they would not have
known what to do without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look up to you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that you guys are like the
coolest people just cause we know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and we know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we live, we live the good life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think, they think that we're over
here just having the best time ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know about the paperwork,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when, yeah, I got somebody else
that does the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I handle the grow and I do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, Hey, you're going to
have to put tags on all these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the greatest part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things is just know what
you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this THCA crystal is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like if I had a lot of money,
like if I got a fat bonus next week at
[SPEAKER_01]: work, I would love to go pick up a grab,
heat up my banger and just sprinkle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was doing Parmesan cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, that's how I got myself
uncomfortably high.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you and I know how to,
to, to work that, how to plan for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to handle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 20 feet from my bed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go down some stairs and I can
pass out face down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My refrigerator is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put someone with a
learner's permit in a Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stuff is super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, uh, my friend Doug asked me what
it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It honestly, it doesn't have flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 90, probably 95 to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if the sign said 95 or
99.5% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and what is not THC is terpenes and
there's not enough to taste anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when they do the extraction,
there are turps left in it and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do it another round to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would fuck up the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I said that it tastes like hot nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only thing it's ever tasted like
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like the dab you took 10 minutes
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heat the nail a little extra because I
feel like I waste it and it doesn't burn
[SPEAKER_00]: properly in the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a salt crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't push it together very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like, uh, the bottom of a sand
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calling this stuff's a little hard
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calling my dad a powder donut when I
rolled my dad in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, but so you can get super high off
the T and I don't know the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: making the THCA at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't know how that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of crystal stuff on the
market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, that's really potent and
really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD crystallines, uh, the THC
crystallines, uh, we're going really far
[SPEAKER_00]: learning how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crystal tech is really coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read this Facebook message that
somebody sent me and see if they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: do have some useful information on the
high, uh, cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of information in my
phone from the person that actually made
[SPEAKER_00]: the HCFSE that we're going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I want to see if this other
guy's got more information because the one
[SPEAKER_00]: guy was at work and he typed it quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we're just going to press pause
real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to do a little bit of
research and read this randomly arriving
[SPEAKER_00]: message because it came at just the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might want to read this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back with you folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what Mike said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly ho neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that dude on Facebook, I replied to
him and he just, uh, he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, do you really want to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, you can see the little type bubble
coming up and he starts typing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it just keeps going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll let him type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably read what he says on
another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have plenty of good information from
the guy that made the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure his name is Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bad with names guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I'm going to blame it on the head
wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I fucking remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, uh, I messaged him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey, uh, I understand you make
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you could explain to me a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, so, and I'm just going to
read the message that he sent me and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind he was at work and he was on the
clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, well, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy just said, if on the show,
don't mention my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Carlos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we can say this guy's name,
the guy that's Facebook messaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said, don't say my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the text message from the guy that
made the, uh, the high cannabinoid full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract sent me a message that
says this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the HCFSE just stands for high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, basically a part of the process we
cause THCA to precipitate out of the low
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbon cannabinoid terpene solution,
causing the THC to crystallize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the process and time taken to
crystallize, you will get a layer of close
[SPEAKER_00]: to pure THCA ranging around 93% or higher,
depending on the amount of terpenes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in the crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you achieve full separation and
crystallization, you can pour off the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene layer to get a more terpene rich
extract with low, uh, with low 10% or
[SPEAKER_00]: lower, which being referred to as HTFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: You follow so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, which is impressive because I'm
super high and that was really specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HTFSE is high terpene full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, and this was explained to me
later by somebody else, they're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes in the solution as a solvent to
dissolve everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be pulling out fats and lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I asked that, I kind of got shined on
it, but they didn't want to tell me a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that I asked questions,
they'll only give me so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash market is exploding so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every people are looking for a method they
can lock in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like, this is Billy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Billy's method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's getting this nailed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't necessarily like sharing
that info.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's letting shatter stay in a liquid form
or he's letting a hash oil, butane hash
[SPEAKER_00]: oil stay in a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that since he said,
uh, and all of this is done with a really
[SPEAKER_01]: fancy closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it allows the THCA to precipitate
out of a low hydrocarbon cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me think there is a,
a hydrocarbon, which is most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could be using a mixed custom mixed
gas, but I'm going to assume it's a butane
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a cannabinoid terpene solution,
which means he's got cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is obviously the THC and terpenes,
which are obviously terps, which tells me,
[SPEAKER_00]: since he said it that way, it's been
de-waxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lipids have been taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no plant, plant waxes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all the lipids and all the,
all the whatever chemicals on butane or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they're using, all of that's
removed at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they've got terpenes and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think they leave the cannabinoids
and the terps and the, uh, the butane in
[SPEAKER_00]: there together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let everything, because then he
says, uh, depending on the process and
[SPEAKER_00]: time taken to crystallize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think he's letting it slowly
evaporate, uh, time taken to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: crystallize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a layer of close to pure THCA
ranging around 90%, 93% or higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what we've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 93% star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, depending on the amount of terpenes in
the crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you achieve full separation,
this is another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you achieve full separation and
crystallization, you can pour off the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene layer and get a more pure terpene
extract with, and then this is where he
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fucked up on his writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he was at work with low,
the 10% or lower with the THC 10% or
[SPEAKER_00]: lower, which is being referred to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took me a couple of readings to
figure out that should say THC with the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC with low THC 10% or lower,
which is being referred to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the high terpene full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make this, obviously the THC
sinks and crystallizes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all the solvents in there,
the stuff that floats is all the terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you let the butane evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it naturally will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how long you let that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bet this was a mistake when they
figured this shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just left something in the fucking
container and it made some stuff in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of a machine that got set somewhere
is what I bet happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, so the terpenes float to the top
cause they're liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC crystals sink to the bottom since
this is a little crystal that sank to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it's got some turps trapped in
it and they're not going to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them out because why leave them in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 93% THC and like 7% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically they've got a column.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've established is the, they make an
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk about how they do the
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grower, I'm a reader and a
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep me out of the extraction lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a column that's filled with
liquid butane, hash oil, which is central,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the, the THC and the,
the terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the butane and then they're
separating that into three different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The butane goes away and the crystals sink
and the turps float.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they pour it off and sell you two
different products, the high cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what I've gotten in the high turp
they had available, but I want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: high, not smoke turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, but for my budget that
I had to spend there, there were so many
[SPEAKER_00]: good things that the turps were the last
on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's basically what this
person taught me about high terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a definite market for stuff that's
got a lower THC content and a really high
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, so HCFSE and HTFSE are basically
the two parts of the extract separated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the two pure forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, does that help at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, he has personally spent
over 650 hours in the last three months
[SPEAKER_00]: perfecting their crystal tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also asked him about their
ambrosia and he tells me that it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of their live resin that he came up
with just to set them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Sean at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Woody at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody at Apothecary
for hooking me up, taking good care of me
[SPEAKER_00]: and for teaching us about the products
that we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the hash revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high cannabinoid full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it, you get a really good
high from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the taste is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they're saying the turps
are all gone because it tastes so good
[SPEAKER_00]: still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a big part of that nice clean taste
is getting rid of all the crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waxes that are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot this week, I've been
vaporizing a lot of Keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an old ball of scissor hash that I
snashed the last time I trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke so differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just I'm purposefully trying to
use up product at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like my Grindr's Keef Catch has been
full for a minute now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like use it or lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavor of that is very,
very planty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's a fairly 60%,
50% or better THC extract at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still very earthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very old school hash flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff just, it's super crisp and
clean, really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't get any of that old burnt
chlorophyll, that heavy dirt flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still get that good Kush earthy
flavor, but it's not that nasty plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material flavor that old school hash
smokers are used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people miss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love when the vets go to the dispensary
and they're like, you got any of that old
[SPEAKER_00]: shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: This new shit ruins me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last retail counter I worked,
I had a selection of stuff for those
[SPEAKER_01]: people that was like, oh, I know what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have stuff that somebody brought in and
just doesn't move until somebody that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in specifically looking for water
hasher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep smelling this Stardog high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got me like, I'm slightly salivating for a
dab of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take one here in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree that that looks like
Parmesan cheese?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little yellower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little yellower for Parmesan,
maybe oilier Parmesan cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting to melt over your food Parmesan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's a really neat color,
a really neat texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slightly crystallized, but when you
touch it, it'll melt into itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bitch to take a dab of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking shatter and putting
shatter on the dabber and using it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: mop to just mop up some.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well that way and it helps
me to conserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get inventive using some of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking at the table thinking
this is a nice glass pencil dabber that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice and gentle on the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six months ago, none of the heads of our
rigs looked like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all metal, all titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past few months I've switched a little
bit to the quartz from the titanium a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quartz, these are 20 bucks at Elevate
for me to replace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we're on the all glass tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are 40 bucks at Elevate for me to
replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edit, edit, edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash tools we've got, sometimes you
got to get real inventive smoking some of
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of it, I'll heat the dabber up
with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just hold the tip for a few minutes,
get it warm enough to get a little melt
[SPEAKER_01]: going on just so it'll hold the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a special tool that's got a
little shovel on it so that I can just
[SPEAKER_01]: scoop in a powdery product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I folded a little card in half and I've
been pouring the THC crystalline into the
[SPEAKER_00]: card and then dumping that into the banger
and that seems to work best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a Facebook reply from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot reveal his identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the podcast, shout out,
let me know what I got wrong about my
[SPEAKER_00]: first rant about the high cannabinoid full
spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read it slowly and say what I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's parts he says, don't say
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, if on the show, don't say my
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the separation happens once in a
jar in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I learned how to extract
the BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, and guys don't fucking do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I say this like safely to let you
know how to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would extract directly from a tube into
a Mason jar because I liked the Mason jar
[SPEAKER_00]: because nothing could fall into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was better than doing it into a Pyrex
dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mason jar has less cleaner,
but more shrapnel-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if shit's going wrong, it's going
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my fucking view of life at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it blows, you want the shrapnel so that
you don't have to live to the explosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a sick fuck that I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you let me blow my shins off if I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to walk around no damn shins
like Cotton Hill, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to go on a rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you turning purple and trying to
hold it back, but this is in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to make BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend taught me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it into a Mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked really well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would take that Mason jar and pour
it into a parchment paper and start to vac
[SPEAKER_00]: purge it on the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy says the separation happens once
the jar is in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you run your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says you run the closed loop
system like normal if you're planning to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a heavy butane pour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of pouring the parchment into a
thin layer, you pour into something deep
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go straight into the Mason jar,
so I was almost doing this shit on
[SPEAKER_00]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I say this probably happened on
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody probably blasted into a jar and
left it there, and it fucking separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, that shit at the bottom
is fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit at the top is terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how this happened,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're involved in the creation of
this, and I'm going to tag the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been messaging in this episode,
I may have to send it to people privately
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can't message this dude
publicly, but I want to know if this was
[SPEAKER_00]: on purpose or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how this came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it like you're going to do a heavy
butane pour instead of pouring onto
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment paper because normally you'd
pour into parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go into a flat layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'd slide those trays into the vac
oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we're going into a Mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many ways from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set until crystallization begins good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just lets it sit there, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour it into a Mason jar, then low heat
vac until I'm basically done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short, high vac at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't go into more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically filled in the questions with
all the detail I fished out from three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four people and a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a closed loop system,
I can put it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we need is 60 grand in the system and
a couple of tanks and butane, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the closed loop system we
would need is only about 20,000 bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just put it on the black card?
[SPEAKER_00]: The red, gold, and green card.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red, gold, and green Rasta credit
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lion will buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lion of Judah Babylon card.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fell off a truck card.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Barefoot's got a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he didn't throw it on 20
Gs for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barefoot, come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about high cannabinoid
full-spectrum extracts because I know you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just hard to get a hold of lately
because he's a popular motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time of year, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get with somebody in the
cannabis industry, call in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because in November, they're
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest should be over by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to call in December, right after
Christmas, right after they spend all
[SPEAKER_00]: their Christmas money on all their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to call and be like, I got a job
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hustle starts again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to give this dude a
shout out because he really filled in some
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run your closed loop system normally
like you normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you pour it into a mason jar and then
it'll begin separating itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you purge it lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds almost easier than making old
school BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires some interesting steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when the boys were
starting to learn how to make BHO around
[SPEAKER_00]: here and I was giving them material to let
them figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept telling them, don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that step right there, don't touch
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little Kev kept going, but I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go play video games for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come over here and dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come over here and take dabs with me for
four hours and then go home and check on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he would have done that, we would have
ended up making this extract on accident
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I water my plants, I'm going to go
look at them and see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to go home and fuck with his hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks, I really can't stress enough how
much you don't want to make hash at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you are making extracts,
concentrates, I call it contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere in the United States,
emptying butane into a closed space like a
[SPEAKER_01]: house is illegal because it's making a
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even out on private land, improperly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis community has eaten a lot of
shit over the last month and a half over
[SPEAKER_01]: optics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the whole community's fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all didn't get together and fuck up the
same way, but every time somebody's
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment blows up, we all take two steps
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of that since 420,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all look like dipshits when shit goes
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing extracts, be extremely
careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do this shit at home, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave this up to professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to do a shout out right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are trying to find some high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that you go to visit my
friends at Apothecary Farms at 3049 Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado, Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to park.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I parked three feet from the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see inside the store when I
parked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medical marijuana facility only,
so you're going to need a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth going to get the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my appointment lined up with the
doc to go get my card renewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do that again now, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing it, you probably about do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had the same thing with my badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new badge week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is my badge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look and see when my
MED badge expires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's come and do all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to reach into the wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time of year, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys would think that Colorado is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking expensive to be this awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of work, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think it's all fun and games,
but this little town that we live in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the price of rent is tripled at some
places in the past two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching this funny thing on a
Facebook group I follow, a whole area of
[SPEAKER_01]: people where the anti-pot group in Pueblo
West is particularly vicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their home values spike this year and
they're freaking out trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's legit or if somebody's fucking
with them because they're getting letters
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that your house is worth
significantly more this year than it was
[SPEAKER_01]: last year and they're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The housing market here has dried up
completely from everybody moving here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are jobs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to come here and consume
marijuana safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to come here and treat their
ailments safely and they want to come
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people come here just to work in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hire an outside trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, shout out to all my friends at Green
Mountain Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, like I said the other day,
they're just trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come trim all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having you guys grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always bring like somewhere between
six to 10 people with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're guys and gals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of them is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that come, I have a lot of fun
hanging out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put me back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind me where the fuck I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a lot of those kids are from Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole group of them that are
like best friends that live together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Sam and Drew and all you
crazy fuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from Florida and they're all cool
as fuck, but they came here and they all
[SPEAKER_00]: work for a trim crew and they're great
fucking kids, but they're here for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because they can freely consume
cannabis without being harassed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over the state of Colorado and pretty
much every state that's legalized it is
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are sick of living under
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no point to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not live somewhere where you can just
swing by a dispensary and pick up some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best cannabis products on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's lab tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold you in a sealed package that you know
that weighs properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ingredients are printed on the back of
this hash container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was channel surfing the other night and
it was a weed kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The episode was on smuggling weed from
California to New York or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the interview with law enforcement,
they're fucking with a dude in a Winnebago
[SPEAKER_01]: and they dig all through the Winnebago
because the dog alerted.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they end up finding is an empty
baggie that had some weed in it and a
[SPEAKER_01]: scale that had some weed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cop goes, why else would you have a
digital scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every cannabis smoker I know has one so
they can make sure their dealer ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need that in the legal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the guy at the dispensary is shorting
your bottle, the shop's going to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude's going to get fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those scales are checked by the department
of ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're insanely expensive scales that are
certified quarterly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're at the dispensary and the
budtender is putting your buds into a
[SPEAKER_00]: container on the scale, there's a camera
directly above the scale that shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers on the scale and that budtender's
hands to make sure that everything goes
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right above the cash register is a very
similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see how many grams go on the scale
and they see how much money goes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cash register every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more cameras at a dispensary
than on any movie fucking set I have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot like being on a casino floor in
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the dice are bouncing across the
craps table, the guy in the security room
[SPEAKER_01]: can see the numbers rolling across the top
of the dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The camera's so clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can see dirt under your fingernails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the VIN number on my vehicle
outside in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can zoom the camera on the light pole
outside down that close.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no point in shopping on the
black market in Colorado unless you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to save a couple bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're just scared or lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're trying to circumvent some
specific dispensary rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a few people that,
why are you going to run my ID?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they take your ID twice in an
inappropriate dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They check your ID two times and I've seen
people, why do you need to see it twice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed it to the guy up front and
they're like, well, yeah, but I'm the cash
[SPEAKER_00]: register.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see your fucking ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not selling it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my job on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me your ID or get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting weed from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to make sure you're who you say you
are and you're old enough for this
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, some people, weird old people,
it's usually, and I'm sorry to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an old veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's afraid to be in a system or run their
ID or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, I mean, especially with
cannabis, we've spent a huge, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: trillions of dollars, millions of man
hours, hunting people down because they
[SPEAKER_01]: had a joint in their pocket, ruining
people's lives because they peed dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many people in this country
still go to work every day with random
[SPEAKER_01]: drug tests being a thing where because you
smoked a joint, the concert that came
[SPEAKER_01]: through two weeks ago, you end up pissing
dirty at work and now you don't have your
[SPEAKER_01]: job anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that whole industry is sort of off
limits for a little while because you just
[SPEAKER_01]: got fired from whatever job because you
pee dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you showed up to work
intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you were high at work and
fell asleep or fucked something up or hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just went to a concert, had a good
time as a responsible adult, went home,
[SPEAKER_01]: pee dirty two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now your kids are, you know,
going to your wife because the child
[SPEAKER_01]: custody hearing went against you because
she told the judge you smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's so many ways that we went
after people because the thing we couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: do is get people to turn each other in for
buying and selling weed with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to come up with a million other
ways to scare people away from it or to
[SPEAKER_01]: ruin your life because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that shit's still in place,
even in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's, I mean, there's definitely
people that are paranoid about going to a
[SPEAKER_01]: shop and getting their name on a list or I
know plenty of people that qualify for our
[SPEAKER_01]: medical program that don't have cards
because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, I've got, I work with a lot of
HVAC technicians and electricians and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that come into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, man, I would love to
just smoke one doobie of all this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I get to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I haven't smoked in 10
years because of my profession.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd lose my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one guy told me he's like,
weed really helps my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She loves to eat edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes those CBD gummies and they
change her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make her pain free and she can sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, go to the store and
get her some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, her dispensary is right up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I gave him directions and he goes,
she can't go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, get her her
cardigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, she can't because then she
can't have her concealing carry permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we live out on a farm and she's always
got a gun in her purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, damn, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to someone at, it was a big
dinner event the other night that I was at
[SPEAKER_01]: with like, you know, weird people,
fancy people in town, the county
[SPEAKER_01]: commissioners and shit were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to wear a suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, you're the weed guy comes up
every time I go to one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the people on my table says,
I'd love to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super interested in to see what it
looks like and what legalization looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of looking at her funny
because I'm like, you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you just drive to a store and
check it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she goes, I'm a teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go to I won't go to one anywhere
in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on the off chance that someone who
recognizes this person as a teacher is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, my God, there's so-and-so
teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't go up in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person was at the dispensary too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they saw you there, they were there
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you guys go burn one together and
fucking relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's plenty of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had plenty of customers at the spot that
would come in and go, I've been working
[SPEAKER_01]: for the railroad or, you know,
whatever oil company for 25 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: 32 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I retired on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drove all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I want to smoke weed for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I got this job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you've really wanted to
smoke a joint for 30 years and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: because you worked for the railroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's plenty of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like once once you get to enjoy
legalization, I don't want to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like leaving Colorado now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some stardog high HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go take a little dab off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's left in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a little smoke left in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a taster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your phrase earlier about taste purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little warm and yeah.
Woo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all Barney like, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to put this podcast back on
some rails?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep talking about random shit,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like stickers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stickers are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to stick them in a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 420 episode, I asked what people
like to smoke, what they like to eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listen to I try to be a little
interactive with my audience because I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like we're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day, somebody sent me this is
just a side note in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day, somebody sent me an
Instagram message thanking me for what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do, telling me that they were kind of
having a shitty day and I kind of brighten
[SPEAKER_00]: them up with a specific episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a feeling it was a stay
positive episode because I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: response from that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm glad I can cheer you up,
whoever you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to call you out because it's
only you're having a shitty day that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for reaching out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I'm cheering people up
and making a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially somebody who's having a shitty
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn their day around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to Steve Simone
because he does that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I'm in a shitty mood,
I listen to Steve Simone on the Good Times
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast with Steve Simone and Lisa and
they just cheer me right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a sip here and then I'm
going to read this message that I got from
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend, Kelvin Medina, who listens all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He rocks a Grow From Your Heart podcast
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his beautiful girlfriend.

[SPEAKER_00]: Drunk drivers suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're going to pick it,
the mauled to death by gorilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quick and easy and then my daughter
gets a zoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more like in bed with a hot chick when
I'm old.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of your friends have died by
getting eaten by a silverback?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd fucking remember that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think I hang out with people
that are memorable for things other than
[SPEAKER_01]: how they died.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How your candle got snuffed shouldn't be
the most interesting thing about your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time
for us to turn off these microphones and
[SPEAKER_00]: put some more dabs inside of our heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
a really rambly podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're still listening, please tweet
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what you thought of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't been on it in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed the fuck out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike doesn't want to turn off the mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike wants to keep miking up the mics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to say good night,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike will be back soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've missed you also, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show will be back next Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mike's wife for letting him
come play for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking at the time like,
man, my kid's going to cry any minute and
[SPEAKER_01]: my wife's asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I get home before that happens so
that I don't get in trouble with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to turn off the
mics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, Mike said it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taken off his headphones already.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out all the social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be good to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke shitty oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray your plants with bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be kind to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't got much else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Colonel Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give your mama a hug for me.
I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: in a position to go clean off that land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't no ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm misery without vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
