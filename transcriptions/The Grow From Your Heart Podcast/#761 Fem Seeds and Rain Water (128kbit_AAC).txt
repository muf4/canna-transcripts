[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I did start off the show by
talking about listener emails that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that portion of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Chase and
it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo, what if you have a pack of
femme seeds but you really want to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: or make seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just use STS on a female plant and
get normal seeds or will they always be
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have femme seeds there is not
a way to make a male plant unless you do
[SPEAKER_00]: something to one of those female plants to
make it create pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without introducing a male plant to
that mix, without having some male pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no way to make regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your seeds will always be female unless
you do introduce a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do put a male plant into the mix
and you pollinate a female, a feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant with a regular male plant the
seeds that come from that will be male and
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about that pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your original question is if you've
only got femmes and you want to make seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: can you make a female plant get normal
seeds or will they always be femme?
[SPEAKER_00]: These will always be femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have femmes to work with
you're only going to make more femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing wrong with breeding from
feminized seeds but I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some sort of out-crossing not just
taking it further filial generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add some more plants to the mix
but this is your project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what you want, breed with love,
grow from your heart, most importantly
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real quick answer, they're always
going to be females and then I do
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you to do your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right big shout out to my buddy Chase
for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, hey man can I use rainwater
instead of distilled water?
[SPEAKER_00]: The quick answer is going to be you could,
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would at least do a basic water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe find out what's in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at least check the EC and the TDS of
that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely check the pH but maybe do a
quick test and find out what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what's in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live near a steel mill that puts off a
lot of disgusting chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rain in my area will probably have
steel mill chemicals in it which will end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in my plants which is probably going to
be some form of heavy metals or some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of junk I don't want in my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly I don't know enough about water
science and what can travel through the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and through the air that way to have
a solid testimony but I wouldn't recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: it if you live in the city or near
chemical plants or a lot of factories and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out in the trees and out in the
woods where the water tastes good then I
[SPEAKER_00]: would definitely recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would use that water but before I
use any water that doesn't come from a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated sort of a municipal system and
municipal source I would check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a way to test it,
if you can't scoop up some water and take
[SPEAKER_00]: it to a water testing place or at least do
a little bit of testing on your own maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: at least just feed it to a couple of
plants before you give it to the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and see what a few plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my version of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are isolated don't have a lot of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is yes you can use
rainwater but think about what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting the water in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you collecting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that water running over as you
collect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it running off of your roof of your
house onto your car then into a bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you actually collecting it in some
sort of a semi-clean manner where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gathering a bunch of shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it washes over is going to end up
into your collection vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to discourage you but I
want it to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something that caught my attention you
said you're using distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you using distilled water for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use filtered water, maybe RO water,
maybe water that went through a big boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time my water here in Colorado
is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just run for the home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even use a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the commercial grow I just use a big
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure why you're using distilled
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be the best idea but if it
ain't broke don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one came from our friend Joseph.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I had a few messages here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to keep cooking right
through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from, you know, we're not
going to say their name because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a question that says, should I worry if my
buds have started throwing nanners at week
[SPEAKER_00]: six of flower then it says in light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I would be concerned if my plants
started showing nanners at week six of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a sign of intersex or
hermaphroditism which is not desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nanners if they are, if they're
viable they can have pollen in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll open up and they will pollinate at
least the buds right next to them possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having nanners at week six is not a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely kind of freak out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you say it's a light depth garden
I'm going to assume that there is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a light leak somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably right where you're seeing those
nanners light is probably getting in there
[SPEAKER_00]: when you think it is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my main assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would assess the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you've got total dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not correct that then I would work on
what to do with these intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they throwing just a few nanners?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just a few maybe you could cut
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a lot I would really start
freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just a couple spray them with
water and pluck them out with tweezers and
[SPEAKER_00]: then keep an eye on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they reappear you got shit to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't come back you're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot I would probably just
cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are past the point now where I don't
think those plants are at risk of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded but it still isn't going to make
the crop any better to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic plant inside of the the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The what is it a hoop house probably in
the light depth situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is probably detrimental to that
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay very close attention if you've
got all clones of the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good likelihood it could
happen across the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got different strains different
plants will have different resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also again I would check wherever that
plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you it's on an outer edge at a
corner or something where the tarp isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: covering perfectly at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the wind is blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still daytime outside but it's
nighttime in your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind is blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a crack in the tarp something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light's coming in right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably right where the culprit
with the intersex plant will be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes you should worry if your buds have
started throwing nanners at week six of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a breeder's nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a growers nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've ran this plant in a smaller
environment to figure out if it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: plant before you put it out in the light
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way sounds like you've got some
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to start thinking about what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right this next question is sort of a
change of pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a little bit different and it
goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have sent someone who is very
popular in the cannabis field 500
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunted seeds he was supposed to work
with and his girls too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh and add his girls too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend sent 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you mean by phenohunted
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been phenohunted yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to phenohunt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they were specially bred or
specially selected seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow our listener sent 500 seeds to a
very popular grower who was supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them and add his girls to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This popular breeder claims he lost all of
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds sketchy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question is what's the best way
to do a collab with someone without them
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's talk about that part first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best way to do a collab without getting
fucked over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a solid relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work with people that you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet people face to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that we're making friends on
the internet and that we're so spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: and that like minded people in one part of
the country are meeting like minded people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the other part of the country and we're
doing shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to send somebody 500
seeds and it bothers you enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to send me an email about it
maybe you need to meet these people face
[SPEAKER_00]: to face shake hands make an agreement do
some things like that before you go into
[SPEAKER_00]: business like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other line of thought is this is partly
why sometimes I don't do business with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing when I started my business
my company I relied on friends for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of their services.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having my stuff made by my friends
because then they get to make some money
[SPEAKER_00]: their business moves my business moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them get to buy groceries with the
money that I gave them and then my
[SPEAKER_00]: business moves theirs moves it feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it's hard to do business
with your friends because when your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends mess up like let's just say that
random company messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that cloud who makes this
this is called the cloud lifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say cloud fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could call them and cuss them out
because I don't know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey my thing fucked up I need a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they give me problems on the phone I go
no listen it broke it has a warranty send
[SPEAKER_00]: me a fucking new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do business with my friends and shit
goes wrong it's like no it's okay buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just eat the loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: When deep down inside you're like fuck I
needed to make that money and now both our
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses are not going to work and I got
weird fucking animosity toward you and you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you're getting one over on me and I
don't like that you're getting one over on
[SPEAKER_00]: me and this is going to last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah that shit sort of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the times I choose to not even
do business with my friends at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's somebody else out there that
can do the job I may hit them up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've recently done artwork for me or
done some shit don't feel like I'm saying
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not my friend I'm saying in most
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do love feeding my friends and
giving my friends work but oftentimes I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just skip them and go somewhere else
because it causes less headaches honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't let that sway you don't let that
stop you from doing business with your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with your crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I started saying this was build solid
relationships with solid people spend time
[SPEAKER_00]: with people get to know them vet them see
how they act go to dinner with somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: how do they treat the waitstaff are they
cool to the waiter are they cool to the
[SPEAKER_00]: waitress are they respectful do they treat
the waiter do they treat the waiter just
[SPEAKER_00]: like they treat you or do they treat the
waiter like the waiters a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff matters you'll learn a lot
about those people so just go spend a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes spend some time with them before
you jump into big 500 seed relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: and business proposals with this people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to do a collab is to do it
with somebody that you trust and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and that there's a reason for you to be
doing the collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just doing collabs with random
people on the internet because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of other people that I know and
trust and have a reputation that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: doing collabs with and it works better
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to do it is just build a
reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other option is contracts you can
write a contract contracts are very easily
[SPEAKER_00]: established written drawn up however you
want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: LegalZoom.com will throw you out a very
simple contract for a very good price they
[SPEAKER_00]: do not even pay me to advertise them
LegalZoom.com will get you out of so much
[SPEAKER_00]: hot water they'll save you so much
headache check them out they'll help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out you can get a contract or maybe you've
got a basic lawyer or maybe you could just
[SPEAKER_00]: find a basic contract online that will
cover what you need done but have an
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement have it in writing have a paper
trail my expectation is this you agreed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this together we expect to do this the
outcome will be this the proceeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: profits will be divided this way in the
case that this goes wrong this is how we
[SPEAKER_00]: will deal with it have all that shit in
paper in writing before you get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: point that's why when you go to the car
dealership you got to sign your signature
[SPEAKER_00]: 7,000 times they're covering their ass
every way that they can so that you two
[SPEAKER_00]: are entering a contract you're saying I'm
gonna get this car they're gonna give you
[SPEAKER_00]: the car the bank is gonna help you out you
don't get any extra shit other than what's
[SPEAKER_00]: on the car but you do have a warranty
you've all got to sign all of that shit so
[SPEAKER_00]: that if anything comes up every nut and
bolt on that car is covered you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same thing when it comes to making
a contract with your friends with your
[SPEAKER_00]: partners when it comes to a 500 seed deal
I would definitely have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangement some sort of protection in
place but first of all man meet these
[SPEAKER_00]: people go shake their hands be friends see
if they're cool see how they interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the community see how are they cool with
their girlfriend are they cool with
[SPEAKER_00]: waitstaff are they cool with their grandma
see who they're cool with see see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: act in traffic just see how they are you
can learn a lot about people it says my
[SPEAKER_00]: other question is because he says he lost
my seeds shouldn't he pay me for my time
[SPEAKER_00]: and effort he's now going to send me 100
seeds of his and his pollen but I feel I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: owed more for all of my time and effort a
year of projects lost what do you think I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that if you would have had that
contract with a stipulation of if you lose
[SPEAKER_00]: my seeds then I get to take your firstborn
child and I get to smash your car with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hammer he probably wouldn't have lost the
seeds he might not assign the contract
[SPEAKER_00]: also get your contract notarized but
that's a whole nother can of worms he
[SPEAKER_00]: probably would not have gone into business
with you if you would have been more
[SPEAKER_00]: strict more of a stickler people that have
contracts and cover their asses don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: taken advantage of so the other part of
this was he should pay you for your time
[SPEAKER_00]: and effort but who determines what your
time and effort is worth is that you or is
[SPEAKER_00]: that him you probably both totally
disagree on what your time and effort is
[SPEAKER_00]: worth you probably totally disagree on
what your seeds and pollen are worth you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel you're owed more it was a year of
projects lost what do you feel a year
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of breeding projects was worth not
only the year worth of the seeds but the
[SPEAKER_00]: year it set you back the year you could be
in progress that's a lot of stuff to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about right there so um man this is
there's a lot to think about here I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have had a contract in place I would have
had agreements in place I would have had
[SPEAKER_00]: goals in place and 500 seeds is a lot to
send somebody that you don't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: at all and really have a bona fide
relationship with so my advice um your
[SPEAKER_00]: first question is how do I do a collab
without someone fucking me over get to
[SPEAKER_00]: know people understand how they do
business understand how they operate are
[SPEAKER_00]: they hiding behind the internet or are
they right here transparent with their
[SPEAKER_00]: face out on the internet pay attention to
stuff like that the second question is he
[SPEAKER_00]: lost my seeds shouldn't he pay me of
course we shall be paid for our product
[SPEAKER_00]: our time and our energy but how do we
determine how much that was worth without
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of that's why you decide how
much the car is worth before you test
[SPEAKER_00]: drive it so that way if you crash it they
know how much you got to fucking pay them
[SPEAKER_00]: so my advice is next time have some
contracts in place have some preparations
[SPEAKER_00]: in line have an agreement and stop messing
with people who you can't trust all right
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the great message I would
say your name but you did not say if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted on here you know who you are thank
you my friend for the great support all
[SPEAKER_00]: right I've got one more email question
here in front of me that I want to read on
[SPEAKER_00]: this show this one came from my buddy
newbie nugs shout out to my buddy noob
[SPEAKER_00]: nugs what's up bro hope you're well the
question goes a little bit like this it
[SPEAKER_00]: says hey rasta jeff I have a question
about when a seed description says indica
[SPEAKER_00]: and sativa percentages is this just
breeders opinion from the phenos they have
[SPEAKER_00]: grown or tested and seen or an estimation
based on what's in the lineage or some
[SPEAKER_00]: lab-tested data to come up with this
number thank you for everything you do bro
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a really good question I think I
could ramble on this one for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: good minutes here currently we are
shifting away from the terms indica and
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa those are gonna be expired terms in
the next few years we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: updated new modern terms for that
broadleaf drug cultivar and weird shit
[SPEAKER_00]: like that are all gonna take over but
we're gonna have to reassess what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: calling indica and sativa one author says
we got it backwards a long time ago we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing it wrong a lot of authors say
that those are expired terms I know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you mean when you say indica and sativa so
they are valid terms for the purpose we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using them right here most of the time an
indica plant is going to be your shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: squatty plant with the big wide leaves
when you smoke it you get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a mellow buzz you want to chill
out the things we call sativa are usually
[SPEAKER_00]: a taller thinner plant with the skinnier
leaves when you smoke that you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic buzz you want to get up and do
shit we're gonna stick with that
[SPEAKER_00]: description for sativa and indica for the
purpose of this podcast question so is it
[SPEAKER_00]: just breeders opinion based on phenos
they've grown honestly there's no really
[SPEAKER_00]: like tried and true hard and fast system
or way to identify this it is honestly the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders we kind of take the plant that we
started with the two plants we say well
[SPEAKER_00]: that one's like 50% sativa 50% indica this
one's like 70 30 and we breed them and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we have a kind of a prediction I've
always got a prediction when I put them
[SPEAKER_00]: together then we just see how they grow a
lot of times most of the stuff that I
[SPEAKER_00]: breed is straight up sativa heavy because
I am breeding for that sativa head buzz so
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of watch the phenotypes that come
out watch the majority of the phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when I say that is 70 30 that's
because out of all of the plants that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen the majority of them would be on
that average it's based on the average of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I see there are always going to be
outliers there are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical differences outliers
anomalies and every thing in every
[SPEAKER_00]: population when it comes to working with
plants or anything with nature with genes
[SPEAKER_00]: and chromosomes any kind of breeding there
will be outliers but the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: compile most of my information is by
watching a lot of grows I grow the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked in a previous episode about
testers growing it I give it out as
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies we start selling it I'm
constantly updating descriptions and
[SPEAKER_00]: details about my strains as I see things
evolve so basically the way that I do it
[SPEAKER_00]: is I watch the plants if I see traits I
know that that's an indica trait if I
[SPEAKER_00]: watch traits I know that that's a sativa
trait so I just decide overall by what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen from every version of that plant
if you've grown a million seeds of dark
[SPEAKER_00]: hollow and I see how it grows then I say
70% of those is an indica we're gonna call
[SPEAKER_00]: it mostly indica I just I use it by
observation and details and then just base
[SPEAKER_00]: it off of averages of what I see is how I
do it I cannot speak for other breeders I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't tell you how other guys are doing
things sometimes I have no idea how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing some of those things
honestly those those phrases indica and
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa are going to disappear I've stopped
putting that on my website most of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: make is really heavy sativa if it's indica
then I do try to indicate that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: more of an indica dominant thing if you're
looking for indica stuff in my lineup I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend the moon tower the dark
hollow maybe the double dose and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future there will be some more stuff that
is a little bit indica heavy for you maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: some indica dominant crosses coming in the
future I did hint that there may be an
[SPEAKER_00]: indica male in the vault all right newbie
nugs I do thank you for the great question
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you a useful answer it feels
like I kind of danced around it and
[SPEAKER_00]: avoided it but honestly there's no real
tried and true way you asked if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab test there's not really a lab test it
would tell you if it's indica or sativa a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of it is based on growth structure
leaf size and then I think a lot of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: determined by terpenes how does it feel
when we smoke it what kind of buzz does it
[SPEAKER_00]: give us so I wish I had a better answer
for you I make my decision by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and just deciding is this indica or
is this sativa all right ladies and
[SPEAKER_00]: gentlemen boys and girls pimps and hoes
friends and foes smokers growers clone
[SPEAKER_00]: cutters and Paul and Chuckers all of you
