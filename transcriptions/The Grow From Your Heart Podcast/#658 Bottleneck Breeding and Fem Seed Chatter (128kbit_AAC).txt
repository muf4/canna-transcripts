[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know the ramble about the video
description, the link in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, I'm going to remind you that I
do include a Discord link in the notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Discord server where there are
a lot of great people hanging out right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something going on on the IRE
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart, IRE Army Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy Ponuck is hanging out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're posting something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave's not here maybe posting something
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Greybeard is doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Stabby is posting something over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the show description in the

[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, before we get too far, I do want to
apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear the air conditioner rattling
in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is approximately eight o'clock as I am
recording and it is approximately 90
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has taken me all day to get this space
cool and comfortable for recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not turning off that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let it just keep on going
until it is almost cold, until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortably cold, and then we'll turn it
down a little bit and let it readjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful that it has cooled down a
little bit and I'm not turning it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear a couple of rattles,
a couple of background noises,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dad joke if I ever heard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

respect all of those subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I want 10,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we hit that 10,000 mark, that is when
the show will pop up in more algorithms.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people will see the show and that you
may like this show or the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: shows will pop up after other people watch

[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to 10,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I think we should have 10 K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to focus on grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to that part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend, slightly
stoned stupid 42 on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of the Patreon
supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I have a question about one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying my hand in breeding and I have
a real nice scarlet begonias female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've chosen a scarlet begonias female
as the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great plant to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great opportunities will come
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm breeding with a nice DJ
shorts, Navy cross male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Navy cross is East coast sour
diesel to the DJ short blueberry F four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be that's an amazing
cross right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the East coast, sour diesel,
that straight diesel fuel chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty funk, uh, almost an aroma that kind
of burns your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, if you, if somebody's got a
bag of that in their pocket and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: in the car, your nose starts to crinkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, man, you got that sour diesel on
you and then your eyes start to feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as I smoke sour diesel
flowers, I feel it in my eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one random note about the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not enjoy sour diesel concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't translate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, something happens when you
make a concentrate that chemically skunky,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, diesel flavor doesn't come through the
way it should in a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a good sour diesel flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never been a big fan of any sour diesel
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something I've really noticed
along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a sour diesel and East coast,
sour diesel cross to a blueberry F four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's going to be blueberry diesel
terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be crazy, amazing,
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine only a good buzz from
anything DJ short puts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, DJ short's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me make a side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honored that you're choosing to use
one of my strains to breed to one of DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: strains because DJ honestly is one of my
heroes without DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wouldn't be an irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is one of the godfathers, one of the
pioneers, one of the founders of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he taught me not directly his books,
his teachings, his podcast to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appearances, uh, his books, mainly a lot
of shit that he has said in magazines and
[SPEAKER_00]: books have taught me a lot of things and a
lot of ideas and have been springboards
[SPEAKER_00]: for ideas and tricks that I've learned,
uh, up to where I am now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, without DJ, I wouldn't be where I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics wouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff wouldn't be where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out, big salute to DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for choosing to breed my
Scarlett to some DJ short work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back on some sort of track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to breed the Scarlett
begonias to the DJ shorts, Navy cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, now to make the strain
stable, do you keep finding the winners
[SPEAKER_00]: and inbreeding them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in short form, it's not inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a filial breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breeding for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But technically what you said is what you
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you say inbreeding, that implies
that you are going to take one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that you made and breed it to one of
the parent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be a bat cross,
a BC or a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make Pete's head explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that would be a bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you want to do, uh, you're on the
right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to, or what is done to stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is your, what do you mean by
stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I see a lot of people say that plant
is not stable and they mean that it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: tendencies to have problems or it's got
this, or it does that stable just means do
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants look uniform when you grow out
a population of seeds, how uniform do they
[SPEAKER_00]: look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the, uh, the phenotype stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think you're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how do we make them stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, uh, that first F1, you're going
to get pretty stable crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to identify the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'll see what you've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now you've got that F1 batch of seeds,
or actually it's technically a poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid, but we're going to call this an F1
batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've taken your scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have pollinated with the Navy cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make them stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find a male and a female from that
batch of seeds that are the winners,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, that have traits which you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where we talk about the
breeding part, which I always like to step
[SPEAKER_00]: in with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two great plants to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see why it would be a good idea,
but I can't see the plants which you have
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the desired outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something about the scarlet
begonias you love?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the DJ short plant that you
really love?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to correct something?
[SPEAKER_00]: You trying to upgrade something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you chasing a trait from one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to combine traits from one
and the other to make one plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your ultimate goal here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Document that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow out those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find if you've met your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a certain percentage of the seeds you
made hit the goal you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they better than both parent plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they look, smell, taste, grow,
appear, perform the way you expected,
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated, and hope those plants would?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you're mostly successful so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then you're not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't make a good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to just either pick another
male plant out of the pack, pick a
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotype, start all over,
or just abandon the project altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your desired goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What traits are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow out these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a female plant that holds the traits
you are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male plant that holds the traits
you are looking for and cross those again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get seeds out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a female that holds the traits you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male that holds the traits you're
looking for and cross it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you do it, you should be
working on stabilization and uniformity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the progeny of the offspring of the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should look similar each time you do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should get closer and closer and
closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you do the cross,
you're going to get like probably you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see somewhere between three, maybe five,
maybe seven or eight different phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the parent plants you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how their genetics
breed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see multiple phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do the F2, you're going to see,
we call it the Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to open up a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see plants that are a lot
the mommy, plants that are a lot the
[SPEAKER_00]: daddy, plants that are a little bit mommy
and daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're also going to see
grandparents on both sides of that cross
[SPEAKER_00]: appear in the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit frustrating sometimes to
work with the F2 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's your job to select the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the proper male and female out of that
F2 population, breed them together and
[SPEAKER_00]: make the F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are going to be, if you've done
your selection properly, these will be
[SPEAKER_00]: more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting more stable is the
word that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start looking more uniform,
more familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your F3s, find the seeds that look
beautiful that do what you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that do what you want and cross
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, you're going to F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get to F4, F5,
you're really looking at uniform plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ stops at four or five most of the time
and he says that is to give you some room
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with it if you choose to breed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed with a plant that is an F4 or
an F5, it's going to be very dominant in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like adding too much hot
sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to overpower everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be spicy at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the easiest way, the main way to do
this is to keep going forward with filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generations and stabilize by selection,
by finding the traits you want and
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting parent plants that perform and
do the things you need and crossing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you select properly, keep going
forward, you will make them stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all about selection from
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: What becomes challenging with that is
sometimes you see outliers and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: play with the outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to breed with the one that looks
just like I wanted to play with or do I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to breed with that fucking weirdo?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing stopping you from
pollinating both of those plants and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: two separate lines and playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I said two separate lines,
let's talk about a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: process of doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your goal is,
but maybe you want the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry diesel and maybe you want the
potency of the scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making up traits and ideas for
the sake of a podcast just to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: springboard to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what I even said now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the potency of the scarlet
begonias and the flavors and aromas of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel blueberry cross, the Navy
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could, in theory, you could keep
crossing male and female and male and
[SPEAKER_00]: female and keep hoping you get that
potency and that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep hoping you get those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the female that's got both of those
and keep crossing and keep crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: further and further until you've
stabilized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or here is another idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed two separate lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take the scarlet begonias,
you take your Navy cross, and you make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you find the male and female that you
like that have the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female's got the flavor you're looking
for and the male has got the aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna work good for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cross it to that female and you
make the flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you F2 that for flavor and F3
that focused on flavor the whole time all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to F4 or F5 and focus on just
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main focus right now is whatever
that flavor you're after, focus in on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say blueberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost smell what a blueberry
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked blueberry headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gassiness with the sweet blueberry to
it with that fake blueberry muffin flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get that in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're searching for that turp on the
blueberry side of the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get a totally different batch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same batch of seeds but a different
selection of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're pulling out a male and female
that breed for nothing but potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't taste super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't yield super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you smoke it, you gotta call
your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be like, bro, I'm too fucking
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find my keys and the keys are in
your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's one of the looking for your
sunglasses while you're fucking wearing
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta turn down the music so that you
could see the street signs better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breed for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just go F2, potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: F3, potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: F4, potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time you get to F4,
F5, you've just bred these plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: every seed just makes highly ridiculously
potent fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now on side A, you have still got
scarlet begonias crossed to navy cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, you've still got
scarlet begonias crossed to navy cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one line is nothing but turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other side is nothing but potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now guess what we get to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to find the correct progeny from
each line and cross those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get the amazing turps and the
amazing potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is when we have got a true F1
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when a true F1 is achieved at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said that we were playing with
polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good way to wrap back to the
polyhybrid part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you work it and stabilize it in such
a manner, it is just a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, it is a true F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've worked the two lines for desired
specific traits with a very specific goal
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have crossed the two in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lifetime process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no hurry to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short has been at this since he was a
very young man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is my senior probably by I'm going
to give him 10 years on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No disrespect DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: We respect you because you are our elder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying DJ has been at it for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your whole life to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to fast track it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going fast will fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow large numbers if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large population will give you
opportunity to find the plants you are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the uniform plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start being very familiar with them
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start growing, if you grow
enough, you'll go, I don't even want these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll just start calling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know these aren't for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not for the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll just start getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll see it on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be really, really good at calling
the plants that do not qualify for your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me make sure I answered all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to make the strain stable,
do you keep finding the winners and
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbreeding isn't the appropriate word,
but you've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a batch of seeds out of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male, find a female, breed them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male, find a female out of those
seeds and breed those together and just
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do two separate breeding
projects to isolate traits and then bring
[SPEAKER_00]: those together in the future, that is a
really beautiful project to really get a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did use the word inbreeding,
which isn't absolutely correct in this
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what you were getting at,
but I'm just going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding briefly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbreeding is basically how we make a bat
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbreeding would be if we took any of the
seeds and bred it to the parent which it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plant biology, it's okay to breed
brothers and sisters together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to breed anything together,
but breeding brothers and sisters together
[SPEAKER_00]: is more commonplace for moving the
generations forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding a parent to one of the children
is actually a bat cross and it's done
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly to stabilize something like a bat
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do that if I didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to make seeds of something
which I only had a female of, and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about that plenty on other shows,
but that is inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go a seed back to one of its
parents is actually the inbreeding in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be done a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to touch on what inbreeding
actually was since you did use that word
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I talked a lot about that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got any more breeding
questions, please do send them to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your heart is the easiest method or grow
from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get them to me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another question here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to my buddy,
slightly stoned stupid 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend red eye and
it says, I was also thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed feminized to feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would we be expecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually came from a part of
another conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of clipped out this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what they're asking about is
if they crossed a reversed feminized plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to a feminized plant, what would we be
expecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, this is just a reversing a
female plant and crossing it to a female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cross, uh, feminized plants to
non-feminized plants, to regular plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: to feminize, to non, however you want to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me a lot of times, is it okay
to breed with feminized plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it okay to keep a feminized plant as a
mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the same thing as a non-fem plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference was back in the,
the pollen stage, we determined that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would not get any males.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a male or a female, uh,
that female pollen hit a female plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: made female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same as any other plant,
except it was guaranteed a female,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Soul taught me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking credit for this analogy,
but think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make feminized seeds,
basically we have learned how to put up a
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the males start shooting pollen,
we have learned how to suck out all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollen out of the air, out of the
equation, so that only female pollen will
[SPEAKER_00]: land onto our female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not at all how the process
happens, but it's a very good analogy how
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to take the male pollen
out of the equation to create all female
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossing, reversed, feminized,
to feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would we be expecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically, uh, making a self
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things to think about that would be a
variable here is our are we reversing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it says a reversed, feminized,
to feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same feminized plant like a
golden goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say I grew, let's just say
lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a better example just for where I
want to go with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is a feminized plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not available in regular seeds at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's say we use the painted lady cut
of lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a beautiful lemon Jeffrey cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take that painted lady cut of lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I reversed that one because it says a,
uh, reversed feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reverse it, treat it with silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now making female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I pollinate that same, another cut of
the same lemon Jeffrey?
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, we're just going to expect
more lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made an S one that is a self
version of that lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a pretty close to
copies stable, if you will, copies of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see a little bit of golden goat
and some phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see a little bit of the lemon
skunk and some phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are going to look just like
the mommy that I use to recreate it
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the pollen donor and the pollen
receiver, basically the mommy and daddy of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant were the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to look like this plant very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of its genetics, uh,
mathematically are this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do, like I mentioned, have the
opportunity to see that golden goat and to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you're going to see weird
outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how genetics work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to get some weird shit
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how genetics work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how hard the breeding is done,
how much work is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature loves to throw you some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nature's will to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we try to control it too much,
that's when it fucking fights back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Oh, you think you got the
breeding dialed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get some weird fucking mutant
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had no idea we're going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, reversed feminized to feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took that lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reversed her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put her on more lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now made a lemon Jeffrey S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is probably a little bit
different than just when you do the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat to the lemon skunk, you're going to
see variation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take that, just the lemon Jeffrey
now and reverse that one and hit the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey again, we're locking in those
lemon Jeffrey traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've washed out the opportunity to see
lemon skunk and golden goat a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: given ourselves even more opportunity to
lock in that lemon Jeffrey trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we did reverse feminized to
feminized, uh, what would we be expecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about, if we pollinate the
same thing, what if we pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different plant that is when we are
doing, uh, what I labeled, what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: calling at some point and are one or a
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do an updated podcast on those
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have received a lot of feedback on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yes, those were kind of terms made
up by our, by our industry, by somebody in
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry, but it works is why I tried
to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anyway, if you put that reversed lemon
Jeffrey pollen on any other plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are now making a new cross and it's
going to work just like if you put,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, any other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen on any other plant, except it's
going to be all female on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see, uh, let's say I'm
just going to pick a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to pick a plant to put this pollen
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put reversed lemon Jeffrey
pollen on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's just put it on the chem de la
chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that sounds fucking amazing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey to chem de la chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get too excited, but it sounds
fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got the reversed lemon
Jeffrey and we're putting it on a chem de
[SPEAKER_00]: la chem pollen or on a chem de la chem
female that wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that one's not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to do to a feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put that on something feminized
orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's throw that on the orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have made, uh, orange,
gas, um, cross to lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be lemon oranges
craziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they both have golden goat
in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get a lot of golden
goat in the progeny there, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't, that's beside the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point here is that you're just going
to make a new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be just like if you were to put
any other plant in a room and pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: any other plant, but since you're using a
feminized starter plant, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring, all of the progeny,
all of the seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that, uh, 99.9% of them
will be female because like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: nature does love to fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how good the breeding is done,
it is possible to find a male,
[SPEAKER_00]: a full on nutty intersex plant,
anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I need to edit that word
out or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I may, if you hear a bleep right
there, you know what word I edited out
[SPEAKER_00]: because YouTube may get on me for that
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, it won't be an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't have male and female parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a straight up full on male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an opportunity to come from
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one in a million or one in,
I'm going to say, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one in a hundred thousand or something
like that, but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know another breeder who has had it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a breeder breed with a male that
came from feminized stock and that makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it does put off some male plants,
but most of the offspring are females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how good the breeding is done,
those plants are going to do what they
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Jurassic park, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life does find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do everything to make the plants
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do our best through
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, let's see, where were we crossing
reverse to feminize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that or reverse feminize
to feminize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about hitting the reverse
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a, the same female to a different
female, the same time you're making a self
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second way you're just making,
uh, our ones reverse plant, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: making new hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I answered that one unexplored had
to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not very unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the breeders are doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some people don't even realize that a,
what if you get a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if somebody passes you a clone of
lemon Jeffrey and you just decide to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably didn't even think if that
lemon Jeffrey came from a feminized seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock, you just have the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't even think about if the
original plant came from a fem seed or a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just out there breeding with fem
stock with reg stock, and they're not even
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it until this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're going to put thought into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to fuck everything up
because now they're aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stumble over themselves
and trip over their own dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how people get, uh,
but it's not very unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been exploring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got experience in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so crossing reverse feminized to
feminized, you're just going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great feminized offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right, you get great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you do it to wonky plants that
haven't been tested, if they have
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, uh, if they're prone to throw
nanners, I'm trying to avoid that one
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a moment ago, the H word,
because we have a friend who got their
[SPEAKER_00]: channel flagged for saying the H word as
hate speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're actually talking about intersex
plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't flag us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if they're prone to do that,
the offspring will do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with your selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you to my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered you because I feel like
I got super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great email here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's not the one we need for the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually here is it's on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, here is the one I wanted to
read on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read the whole message
because it is, uh, quite long and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the point kind of quickly here
without reading all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend,
Devo buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This did come from the irie genetics
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a grow help tab on the irie
genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to irie genetics.com,
you will see the grow help tab click on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you a few, a few preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you what name you would like to be
called on the podcast in case I do read
[SPEAKER_00]: your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Devo buds
getting their message right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you what strain you're growing,
where you're growing it, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, just a few basic questions to help
me help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one is from our buddy Devo buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing a random seed indoor under
led.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are five weeks in, uh, they,
their last feed was a five gallon rez,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with 19 mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've broken down every mill of every
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to read all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding, uh, botanic care,
Cal mag, advanced nutrients, sensei bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: a and B bud blood, a quarter scoop of
great white, uh, PPM or EC of the last
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for what you're putting in there,
that seems a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit low and for week five of
bloom, that's a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a couple other things in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daytime temps are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime temps are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No reports on humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm going to read part of this and
we may end up editing this because this is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to review all of this here,
but it does go on to say, what's up you
[SPEAKER_00]: bad motherfucker on my last flower run,
which was my first flower ever during
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made several mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is going to happen, but owning
up to those mistakes is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing half strength of the
recommended feeding as I, as it was
[SPEAKER_00]: working well in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I continued that same pattern when
flipping to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All was well until week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're doing the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we say, uh, podcasters,
people who teach you about growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we say that you only need to use about
half strength of what a nutrient company
[SPEAKER_00]: recommends on the bottles because they do
want you to buy more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always add something to your
plants, but you can't take nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off at half strength,
see what the plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're responding, like they're
hungry, if they want more of something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can give it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're acting like they're being
burnt or overfed, then you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to reduce it, start off weaker,
work your way up, dial it in, figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend here was following good
advice, going about it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were feeding, uh, half strength
nutrients and they were happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant seemed happy until week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, then week five, I,
let's see, I noticed the PPM of the runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: was going up every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they quit eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added fresh 5.5 pH water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that water pH was way too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pissing the plants off,
uh, only to top off the res midweek,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the runoff each day continued to
climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after two days, I dumped the res and
started to flush with RO, uh, with RO
[SPEAKER_00]: water with a pH of 5.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the rest of the week,
I just watered with RO water at a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, watching the PPM drop back down
from 1200 to 1850.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were getting a runoff of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of 1850.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continued this for a week and never
dropped under 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a couple of things to mention
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, did the plants look okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't talk about what the plants
looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just said, then in week five,
you noticed that the PPMs were way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you don't mention that the plants
looked upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing pH meters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing EC meters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we growing plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants looked angry, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't include that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, but if you're just
changing things up and doing random
[SPEAKER_00]: chaotic shit to your plants because of a
meter and the plants didn't say anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to make the fucking
charts happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of my toys, my equipment,
my meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes life easy, but those aren't what
I paid the most attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants, I know what the plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they look happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I make a mental note of what
parameters those plants enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that these plants like it about 82
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it about 60% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like a little bit of wind in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when I water them this often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I set up devices that will tell me
when those parameters are being met or
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're not being met.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pay too much attention to the
room, to the equipment, to the runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the pH coming out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're angry, they'll tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can start checking my monitors,
my meters, looking at reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see, oh, a couple of days ago it got
really hot in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that today they're acting a
little bit goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days ago the runoff on the pH was a
little bit high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're acting goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can react.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look at runoff numbers and say the
numbers are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to change something.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you start doing that,
you fuck up the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main thing to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't mention that the plants were
mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just say that the numbers were wrong,
so you changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you said you called the manufacturer
and tech support and got reprimanded for
[SPEAKER_00]: only using half of what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My notes on my page straight up say fuck
that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody reprimanded you for using
their product the wrong way, fuck that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've only got to go by what you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said they reprimanded you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I called a company and I was like,
hey, I need help with your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they reprimanded me, fuck that
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never give them another dollar of
my hard-earned money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't even hear from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even take the energy to talk
shit about them on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just forget they even existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand you're talking about,
until you brought them up, I basically
[SPEAKER_00]: forgot they existed anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let a nutrient company reprimand you
for doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had good quality customer service,
what they should do is take you by your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand and guide you through it and do it
the proper way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to call themselves customer
service, that is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was a dick move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't cool at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an ego problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a control freak and having an ego
problem, if you want somebody to use your
[SPEAKER_00]: product, you don't reprimand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you should reprimand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you called me and you're like,
dude, this product isn't working,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, well, let's figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have a phone call with you,
and we'd talk about what did you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's where you went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how you can fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call me in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't reprimand you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the way shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't give them any more of
your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abandon ship with those guys is my vote
with your dollars is what Scottie Rue
[SPEAKER_00]: would tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on, but man, I think I've answered
most of your questions, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a little bit more of
this, but honestly, one of your mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: was adjusting due to numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't adjust due to numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is the plants are the boss
in this whole situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the investors, not the owner of the
facility, not the IRS guy, not city
[SPEAKER_00]: planning and zoning, not the consultant,
not the lead grower, not the grotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the trimmer, not the compliance
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those people are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all like to think they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all like to think we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants dictate everything in that
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should make a schedule for the plants
and you should have some stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't write the rules and the
schedules and they can't go get food,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them be the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to read more of this,
but when you said you got reprimanded,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, that's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever let a manufacturer reprimand
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should call them back and tell them
that Rasta Jeff said to go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vin says, I didn't think it was right
either, but I'm not going to argue with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so they did tell you to use it full
strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know better than them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the PPM stayed high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they started to drop again and the
plants are now showing sign of flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you've been doing so much to
them now that those plants are just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in, if you're in any sort of hydro
like that, they do, they show you results
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly and you've done a lot to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured I'd switched PPM to EC on the next
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a different scale may have messed
you all up too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I checked the trichomes during all
this time, they turned from clear to some
[SPEAKER_00]: milky and some seem to have stalled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read more of this to myself
really quickly and we'll see if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out anymore or if we've covered
the important parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvested time to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's the best way to do it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut it down and take note of what you did
and learn from it and know what to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: what not to do next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of learning is learning what not to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you, if you get everything
right, every time think about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you're a skateboarder or if you're
doing some extreme sport, you're out there
[SPEAKER_00]: on a fucking freestyle bike or a
motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you nailed the trick the first time,
every time you're never going to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, you're going to get a big head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a big ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it comes time to perform in
the X games, you're going to get nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not going to be able to do the
basic tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you've been out there doing stale
fish three sixties can't even fucking kick
[SPEAKER_00]: flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to learn from your mistakes,
crash and burn and hurt yourself is where
I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was trying to head,
uh, fall down, get some road rash,
[SPEAKER_00]: rake a couple bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll learn, I don't need to do
that shit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll learn that I got to put my foot
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to put my foot here and you'll start
landing your tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was trying to go with all
that nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a lot to this message,
but you've harvested, uh, this message
[SPEAKER_00]: came in a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my main point of this dude is,
uh, don't grow meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't adjust too much to the meters and
then don't ever let a nutrient company
[SPEAKER_00]: representative talk down to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are, uh, but no,
nobody should ever reprimand you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, maybe your mama or daddy,
but that's the only persons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and maybe you're married too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't have page two of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there was a second page to this,
but I feel like I have answered most of
[SPEAKER_00]: this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually came to us quite a while
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that crop has been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to make sure to read that
because when you said you were reprimanded
[SPEAKER_00]: by the representative of that grow
company, it definitely, uh, it made me
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to come on here and just make
sure that you, uh, stand up for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my main point is don't grow meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing EC meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all my toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my friends that give me meters and
make programs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going, come on, use the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, but they're not the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meters are what I use to, uh,
as markers and indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a problem, then I go to the
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants say something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can usually identify a problem,
but I can use the meters, the programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the notes to kind of back up my claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have to go to a facility owner and
say, Hey, I think this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to spend money on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, well, the plants show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The status shows this report, show this,
and this piece of equipment shows this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've isolated the problem to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, that's good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll order the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think I don't just go, Hey,
the plants are looking like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to add Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, Oh, how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, cause they're showing the little
rusty spots, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, no, let's look at the reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some shit and let's fucking
back that claim up with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we adjust the Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to make sure to get that one
answered because it did come in quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: ways ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I rambled through that one
quite a bit, but one of your problems is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're mixing brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you are doubling up on your
base nutrients in this also use a more
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a brand that didn't reprimand you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend using new millennium
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that,
but they're good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got great customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my teachings are based on
using their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using them, you can follow
along very easily with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but don't let anyone reprimand you
and, uh, grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry so much about the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pamps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen,
