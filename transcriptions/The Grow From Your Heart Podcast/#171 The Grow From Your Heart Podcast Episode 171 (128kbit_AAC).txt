[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 171 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.

current state of cannabis, this,

[SPEAKER_01]: Bring me up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be getting a head cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something sounds a little muffly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, listeners, if it's muffly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's just my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it in your head or is it in the gear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm thinking it's in the headphones
because the music sounds good,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my voice sounds stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get over it and we're going

[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that, Granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun meeting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one time we got to meet at Granny
Canyon and I can't wait until we run into
[SPEAKER_03]: each other again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get you guys here together on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a good time.

ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davin Granny and Action Bronson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Davin Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, since we're doing shout outs,
I need to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends at Handmade Apparel.

Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've printed my iReGenetics t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got a bright red Handmade Apparel
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a green Handmade Apparel hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got hat pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got stickers that these folks made
and everything is top quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made in America by Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by dab kids who take dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They dab just as hard as you and I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's great to support the

[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great to support our friends
that are doing this with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good friends of mine and they make
great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them as much as I do.

[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could all be in the same Handmade gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the Handmade crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, go to
HandmadeApparel.biz and check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some stuff printed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan of the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically shirts that are printed with
logos and stuff, the logo goes first.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of my Handmade stuff, the shirt is
going a little before the logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: The logo still looks fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wear, if you know me,
I'm kind of a cartoon character is what
[SPEAKER_01]: they call me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a hoodie with iReGenetics logo
and I take off my hoodie and underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: that is iReGenetics t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the exact same logo and a different
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wearing probably, I have not
thrown any of them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been rocking these t-shirts for
probably five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the first one, I have not thrown it
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The logo is still crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shirt, however, is getting that black
shirt dinged to it, but the logo looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was freshly painted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can only hold up for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've beaten the living hell out of mine
and the logo still looks fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sweet shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've given them a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to my friends at Handmade
Apparel for all the stuff they've printed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, they have the best rates for hat
pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting your hat pins made,
go through Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried a lot of companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Handmade Apparel was the most reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do the artwork in-house and they have
the pins made, so it's all one group,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you don't have to have different people
working together and fucking you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do great artwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out, much respect, big hugs,
all that stuff to our friends at Handmade
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out,
HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've said that enough times.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do you want to chatter about
before we get into our main topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you want to jump into the... It
feels like so much has happened since the
[SPEAKER_03]: last time I was on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of stuff's happened since the
election.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should probably just dive right into
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off with the letter from the
DEA that came out just a couple of days
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have time for it, we will do a
couple of election updates, because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: you love getting to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listeners have asked for longer lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was me clapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't clap like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of listeners are like, hey bro,
I want a longer episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I've taken on a new project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk a lot about this project that
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kept it on the down low, but it keeps
me busy for 45 or 50 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been doing two podcast episodes
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my best to get longer
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the past couple episodes have
been a little not as informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was over fucking well, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's super busy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a kiddo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a new project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hanging out with my mom earlier
today for quite some time talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas presents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just wrapped a killer outdoor grow
session again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jesse for coming and
helping us do some outdoor grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I got to pack so much info
into every single episode though.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I don't give a full informative
episode, I feel like I'm kind of cheating
[SPEAKER_01]: myself and the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are episodes where I've had to stop
and pause repeatedly while I take notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so hyper detailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got those podcasts in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the folder right here in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all those pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: This show gets more impressive every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to perfect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are episodes that are going to be in
depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of a perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they come out like that, they're
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, we're going to talk about
... You like how I pulled that background?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been podcasting a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this podcast, we're going to talk about
a letter that the DEA sent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who the hell did they send it to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they just publish it or was it
actually mailed to people?
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the big dust up this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: The letter that everyone freaked out about
over CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did your face just break?
[SPEAKER_03]: This story almost broke me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big dust up is basically saying the
DEA just made CBD illegal again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's silly because it was never legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read this news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're definitely going to talk about
why it's silly and we'll talk about a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of details.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of different versions of
this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main part that I want to focus on is a
quote.
[SPEAKER_03]: This story is a great example of just how
fake news can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: The different degrees of bullshit that can
work their way into a press story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read it in three or four different
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part I want to focus on is mainly
quoted from the DEA themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can't be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the buffers around it, we can talk
shit about a lot on every website.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I chose the one ... The Leafley
article looked like a crock of shit to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like the Leafley article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose to go with the article from the
Green Rush Daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Green Rush Daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline is, the DEA just banned CBD
and here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a giant ad and then I finally
scroll like seven scrolls and I get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the legality of CBD is no longer
in the gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the DEA just banned CBD,
cementing its place in the list of
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule one substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD or cannabidiol is a compound or
cannabinoid in cannabis that won't get you
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does do though is stop seizures
and aid in suffering from ... Jesus,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one that wanted to talk shit about
an article and I can't speak English well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The words, debilitating is the word I was
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I nailed cannabinoid and cannabidiol,
but I can't say debilitating, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mouthful, especially on a phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, especially after all those dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dabs never help with reading aloud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be the exception to that rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an introvert and then sometimes when I
smoke a lot of dabs, I get chatty and I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to go for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, why is the DEA putting it on the
list of the most harmful drugs available?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both alternatives to more
dangerous prescription opiates that are
[SPEAKER_01]: plaguing the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA actions seem to protect big
pharma's pockets more than the health of
[SPEAKER_01]: American citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the point that I wanted to get
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about a conspiracy that I
agree with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, they were doing so
well and then they went off into fucktard
[SPEAKER_03]: land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fucktard land was somewhere I wanted
to venture into later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to jump right into
Tartville.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that maybe has something to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see that there are pharmaceutical
companies working with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want us having that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to corner that before we do,
so they're just going to shut us down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, you can't even play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we win.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just landed on free parking by
fucking us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The archaic spelling of the word marijuana
with an H is used in the federal register
[SPEAKER_01]: announcing the rule, probably to avoid
turning up in marijuana-related search
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how the fucking feds spell it,
you fucking conspiracy fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you said Green Rush Daily,
I was like, oh, fuck, and then you said
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a big ad at the top and I went,
oh, fuck, and I knew where this was going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this will be helpful for our
listeners because those are two ways to
[SPEAKER_03]: spot fake news.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how the feds spell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what a lot of the fake news is
oriented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, everybody has heard of CBD by
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coast to coast CBD is a household term
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have seen through Sanjay Gupta's
specials and through YouTube videos and
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook posts how helpful it can be with
Parkinson's, with seizure disorders,
[SPEAKER_03]: with DeVay syndrome, with pain management,
with the change in federal policy with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Ogden memo and the Cole memo that led to
marijuana markets like we have here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado where they're legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those like Colorado's included
legal hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, the year before the feds,
just like the Cole and Ogden memos did for
[SPEAKER_03]: high THC cannabis, they put out a little
blurb in the farm bill covering industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp and putting a definition for what
industrial hemp is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the guise of that legal loophole,
a number of companies, both domestic and
[SPEAKER_03]: foreign, started selling CBD extract
online in all 50 states, making it
[SPEAKER_03]: available pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Companies like CBD Lifewater have sprung
up that are trying to get distribution in
[SPEAKER_03]: all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's under a gray market loophole created
by the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in no way legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The feds have always considered every part
of the cannabis plant, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's sativa, indica, hemp, ruderalis,
they don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me jump in right there because that's
right where I am in this article.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, and they spell it marijuana with an
H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these laws are based in fucking
racism and that was a lot of where the
[SPEAKER_03]: original basis for these comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the feds write a new marijuana
law, it's on the backs of all the old
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana laws and they keep the same
racist ass spelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff's giving me a look like I know,
but let me finish the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're fired up and I like it,
but I have to get through this article to
[SPEAKER_01]: make this show a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the reason given that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is complying with the international drug
control treaties, wait, the reason giving
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the, okay, it says that they are
complying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the DEA's stated reason for the change
this week is to help them comply with
[SPEAKER_03]: international narcotics treaties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they say, before this elaboration,
CBD's legality was in a gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was assumed that CBD extracted from
medical cannabis was only legal for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana patients and illegal to
the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, CBD derived from industrial hemp
was being sold across the country as if it
[SPEAKER_01]: were federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently the DEA has always
believed any form of cannabis extract to
[SPEAKER_01]: be schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now I want to, if I handed you a CBD
molecule, a scientist, a CBD molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I said, did this come from hemp or
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd probably tell me to go fuck myself
because it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would say it's a molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the DEA claims that there are small
amounts of cannabinoids in every CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cite this as another reason to keep
CBD on schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: For practical purposes, all extracts that
contain CBD will also contain at least
[SPEAKER_01]: small amounts of other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if it were possible to produce
the form of cannabis plant, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: they wrote this weird and there's an ad
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm skipping through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Produce from the cannabis plant an extract
that contain only CBD and no other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such an extract would fall within the new
drug code.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the DEA made extracting CBD
completely illegal, whether it's from hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: or not, whether it is pure CBD,
because they are wrong right there when
[SPEAKER_01]: they say that you can't get pure CBD
because I know, I'm thinking counting,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put five fingers up and confidently
say that I know five people that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: call friends that can make CBD isolate
that is 99.8 or 9% CBD, that one or 2% is
[SPEAKER_01]: atmospheric conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things like oxygen in there that
they cannot control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get 100% pure CBD, lots of
different places.
[SPEAKER_03]: The DEA's position on it doesn't have
anything to do with there being trace
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just something that happened to
mumble during the press conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always been, CBD has always been
illegal just like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every part of the cannabis plant is
illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds are illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaves are illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The root ball is illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pot you grew it in is illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if it's industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every year, or just to be safe,
every 18 months, some drug task force
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere like East Bumfuck, Texas makes
the announcement that they've just found
[SPEAKER_03]: the world's biggest pot farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're raiding it today and they
didn't catch any growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's headline news on Monday and it's
headline news on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's nothing about it in the
press on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next Friday, it comes out that it was
a wild hemp field on some farmers back 400
[SPEAKER_03]: acres in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the weather conditions that
spring were perfect for feral hemp to go
[SPEAKER_03]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the DEA will spend $100,000 ripping
all of that feral hemp out of the ground
[SPEAKER_03]: and burning it because it's the dangerous
marijuana plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter that it's growing wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have anything to do with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoked any of that stuff,
if you harvested, dried, and cured it
[SPEAKER_01]: properly, all that shit would do is give
you a headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an Indian reservation,
I want to say it was in New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere hot and kind of miserable to
live, where feral hemp was just
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd found a way to basically build
whole houses with it, with hemp creed and
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple of other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were doing it all on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the feds would show up every now and
again and burn their hemp down because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's dangerous hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this happens all over the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: The DEA wastes small fortunes,
ripping wild hemp plants out of the ground
[SPEAKER_03]: that are left over from the 30s and 40s
when hemp was grown as a crop all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: US.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's a terrible heroin epidemic
everywhere right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs is littered with crystal
meth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meth is everywhere in Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are driving around on bicycles
looking at fucking trash cans all over
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo, Pueblo is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Friday night right now, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Friday night at 1030.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people that used to be out raging,
doing heroin, not all, but a good fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of our young people are out doing
heroin right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the DEA is worried about fucking with
plants that keep us calm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not even cannabis, fun cannabis
that gets you stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hemp, the stuff you make jeans with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Houses, bricks, textiles, necklaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an infinite number of products you
can make with hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was part of the reason they
included the exemption in the farm bill
[SPEAKER_03]: last year, the year before, to designate
what exactly is industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody, I mean, everybody,
everybody understands how absurd our hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: laws are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as law enforcement's concerned,
cops can't tell the difference between
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp and weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're pretty sure you can grow the
two next to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could hide your high THC plants and
among your hemp plants, which anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: that's ever grown either crop knows how
insane that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But law enforcement across the country
still argue shit like that in federal
[SPEAKER_03]: court to keep the DEA making decisions
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sansal is growing a bunch of, it's all CBD
plants and it looks like killer cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they told me that that was white widow
or something, I honestly couldn't tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference on their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have got very cannabis looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them can be very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends what the hemp you're growing
has been bred to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I understand what Sansal is doing
is they're producing CBD extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows just like flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the type of hemp you would want
for a high CBD extract production.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm guessing that hemp strain would be
crap if they tried to make fuel oil or
[SPEAKER_03]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fibrous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, then that's one of the great
things about cannabis is it can be bred
[SPEAKER_03]: one way or the other to achieve an
infinite number of final products.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the feds are concerned,
every single part of it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only legal hemp or marijuana products
that are federally legal in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States are hemp clothing produced in other
countries or produced from fabric that was
[SPEAKER_03]: grown in other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Silly lotions and hemp seed oils and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, products that were produced with
plant material grown in other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else is at least a gray market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The FDA and a couple other national safety
organizations released a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We even did a blurb about it on the show
about the foreign companies selling God
[SPEAKER_03]: knows what is CBD extract or CBD product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were testing it and it didn't have a
lot of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it did, but it had a lot of other
crap in it you didn't want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with it is filler.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you get in a gray market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a lot of knockoff products.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a lot of mislabeled products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why I've been freaking out
about getting people politically active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they're doing this for their
own financial gain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the pharmaceutical companies
are planning something with CBD products?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple in Great Britain and
around the country that are already
[SPEAKER_03]: working with THC CBD products.
[SPEAKER_03]: GW Pharmaceuticals is working a couple of
different product lines, but they're still
[SPEAKER_03]: five, 10 years from market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that the pharmaceutical industry
don't want THC and CBD products.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an industry, I'm sure they would prefer
to have control of all medications that
[SPEAKER_03]: people take, but that's not physically
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to make me better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to mask my symptoms and keep
feeding me a pill to make me a customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And greed is the one conspiracy theory
you're going to give me to buy into
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with a decision like this,
this is just business as usual.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been true since 1940.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are freaking out about this
decision today because they issued its own
[SPEAKER_03]: serial number so they can track the
Caesars separately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I encourage the move because
tracking shit separately is helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, any anti marijuana group is
going to tell you that 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 years ago, the average THC content in
marijuana was one to 3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can back that up with DEA seizure
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that's true is because
they've been seizing fields of fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: feral hemp every year for decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's always been illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nothing new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tracking it separately helps us figure
out, OK, exactly how much did they waste
[SPEAKER_03]: ripping up hemp out of the ground?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much money did they waste making sure
Kansas didn't get their hemp seed last
[SPEAKER_03]: year?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much money did they waste rounding up
hemp seed off the internet or hemp oil off
[SPEAKER_03]: the internet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the side of the highway as you drive
to New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how many people since they've got
these companies that are shipping CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to have to like the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I want to say anybody's
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get any people in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know people personally, and there
are companies in Colorado that will ship
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD products nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be in Maine, California,
and they will send you a bottle of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are those people that were relying on
those medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they going to do now?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who I'm mainly worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're screwed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were always like their access was
only obtained through a gray market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they were paying attention,
they knew that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've been lobbying for a different
way to access whatever product they
[SPEAKER_03]: desperately need in their area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to say come to Colorado and
we've got CBD for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a CBD drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way like everybody thinks they're
going to come to Colorado and go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical dispensary and get high CBD
medicine, and they are highly
[SPEAKER_01]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not much CBD medicine available.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not much and what's available is
expensive because there's a shortage and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's been a shortage for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to find yourself a private
caregiver who they're trying to squeeze
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the system now anyway, or you've
got to grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got to find a CBD clone or
you've got to find seeds of something high
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got to grow it and then
you've got to get it tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: People focus a little bit too much on
testing when it comes to personal
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to do an episode on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if medicine works for you,
it works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't pay attention to the lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of elaboration I want to
do on that, but we'll save it for another.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff that lab testing
brought to the community that's just
[SPEAKER_03]: bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: People focus on all the wrong numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved watching the CBD industry explode
over the last two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take that from what I'm saying
because I think that should be available
[SPEAKER_03]: to everyone everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the society would be a lot better
if more people were adding CBD to their
[SPEAKER_03]: diets regularly as a supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps with a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge CBD advocate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use it daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your daily dose of CBD?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now I'm restricting myself because
the product I'm using, I'm limited on
[SPEAKER_03]: accessing any more of it ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That won't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The person that's making it is gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making it last.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the worst part about these
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now I'm at two or three CBD dabs a
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I space them throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm not hurting that day, maybe I'll
only take one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll take just a little itty bitty
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll just use some of the pain cream
I've got left instead.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm purposefully going slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was taking it as milligram pills,
it was 50 milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 in the morning, 25 at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 to keep you pain free at day,
25 to get you sleeping through the night
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortably.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just make it easy because I never
went wild with it because I like it half
[SPEAKER_03]: and half THC CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to be eating 50 milligrams
of THC before I went out into town and did
[SPEAKER_03]: my day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was keeping it to 25 and then adding
more during the day if I needed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can consume huge amounts of CBD when I'm
hurting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an issue with two of the
vertebrae in my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't happen often, but every now and
then they twang off each other like a
[SPEAKER_03]: rubber band.
[SPEAKER_03]: That feeling is pretty excruciating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the area around where those two twang
will get inflamed and hurt for several
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: To a degree where I can't really bend or
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I feel it's twang and I eat a whole
bunch of CBD, like 300 milligrams right
[SPEAKER_03]: away, it won't inflame to the point where
I'm down the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot about if you get on it as
soon as you feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you feel it, get that CBD
edible in you and if you can, take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's instant absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a dab is instant effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just dabbing, but any inhalation
through the lungs, that makes it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: bloodstream incredibly quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get relief in seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, it's seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you eat it, you're looking at half
hour, hour, hour and a half, two hours
[SPEAKER_03]: before you've got full effect of what
you've consumed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The effect of what you eat is going to be
a little stronger, but that delayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're taking it for pain, you can't
wait two hours for your pain pill to kick
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD was never legal in all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how you looped that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just called that back like a
professional comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a loophole that everybody was
operating under.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so glaringly obvious a loophole
that Chinese companies dove all over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, that was going to get shut down
at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not even what this was.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was just the DEA assigning its own
serial number for when they do seizures.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even release a letter saying,
we're going to go after the people selling
[SPEAKER_03]: this shit online.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a reminder that all parts of the
cannabis plant are illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our community is still not
politically aware, let alone politically
[SPEAKER_03]: active.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I bring you on, Mike,
because you can remind them and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: try to blow up the fucking- Huge segments
of the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just the marijuana community got this
story wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I freaked out about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tying it to every conspiracy
theory there is against marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read on a fairly reputable news site.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an opinion piece that they chose to
publish about because they use the
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana with an H spelling in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was because Trump was elected and
racism is now openly accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an indication that the DEA was
going to round up the stoners and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading this like, Jesus, we've come
so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had a huge night on election
night, marijuana won big in so many
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing we do to celebrate is give
ourselves a black eye, and then another,
[SPEAKER_03]: and another, and another, and another,
and another.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't need a fake new shit storm this
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough real news that we should be
focused on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because so much of our community isn't
aware of the legalities nationally for
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant we all love, this story's
spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen half a dozen businesses down
here post it, and it's like, you're a
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have known this better than
anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The businesses, the CBD businesses that
were sending this shit through the mail,
[SPEAKER_03]: their lawyers should have made this
perfectly clear to them that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: operating in a legal gray area through a
loophole in a fucking farm bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that as far as the feds are concerned,
all parts of the cannabis plant are
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal regardless of THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be just the root ball of a hemp
plant that dried up or was harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years ago, and it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still be charged with a federal
crime for having it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the reality of our
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I have so much respect for even
the marijuana business owners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hate because they're standing up
and risking a lot for us, for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everyone in the marijuana
industry, working hard every day,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked a lot about this DEA
letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that clears that up and calms
you down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send your hate mail to neumobunk15 on
Twitter or at Pueblo for sensible cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the positive stuff can grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for listening to the DEA part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move on to a little bit of
updating stuff of things that we've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about in the past because on our
post-election episode, we mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: a...
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the little bit of bad news we had
for Pueblo for our election night.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an election question,
should we allow retail marijuana stores
[SPEAKER_03]: inside Pueblo city limits?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it called on the ballot?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that initiative?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an initiative?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what I voted on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the thing I voted on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Initiative amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of... Initiative was
the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was trying to... I honestly
don't remember which one this was.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was one... The ballot question
is how I tend to defer to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought it did not pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we recorded our post-election show,
it was failing by like 150 or 200 votes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time they got all of the
provisional ballots counted and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: ballots that were stuck together and
whatnot counted, we won by five or 600
[SPEAKER_03]: votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will be able to have recreational
cannabis stores within the city limits of
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_03]: December 27th, I believe, the city council
is the Tuesday after Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: City council will be voting on the final
rules and regs package for rec shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they're in a good mood after their
Christmas break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they don't get what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I've been involved with
this for a long time, so I know way more
[SPEAKER_03]: about it than I should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the people that are working on it
right now, I probably know more about it
[SPEAKER_03]: than they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ordinance that they're about to vote
and probably pass into law was written by
[SPEAKER_03]: a zoning commission that was very dead set
against allowing marijuana businesses in
[SPEAKER_03]: the city at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at a certain point, they discovered
that with one or two zoning buffer rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: so 1,000 feet from schools and 300 feet
from residences, that they could
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially limit the number of marijuana
businesses in the city to about a dozen
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's all the property that's
physically available.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they include those two buffer zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to make that even more restrictive,
if they've decided to limit the total
[SPEAKER_03]: number of stores in the city to eight,
four north of the river, four south of the
[SPEAKER_03]: river.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city is preparing for a wave of
applications and they've come up with a
[SPEAKER_03]: point system and a timeline for that
application process to take place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully by the end of the year,
we've got at least a couple of retail
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana shops open in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wish the rules that we're about to
pass are different, or we're different,
[SPEAKER_03]: are different, but that's very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing what I can to get some of the
craziness taken out of them, but there's
[SPEAKER_03]: only so much change that they're willing
to make right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're catching on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of slowly evolving.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very different city council than
the one we had a year or two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is a process that started
four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been four full years that the city
has been working on this particular set of
[SPEAKER_03]: rules and regs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how long I've been working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think since we had the first shop,
do you think we could get just first in
[SPEAKER_01]: line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, hey, can we be back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, just play that card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, hey, we was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of that part of the city is blacked
out due to schools because the thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: foot from schools rule isn't just
classrooms where there are students.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the college owns an empty apartment on
whatever street, then there's a thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: foot buffer around that empty apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around that empty apartment's property
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the library in such count?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for this rule package, but that tends
not to matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were several other buffer zones
listed around our medical shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is why they've been allowed with no
stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've worked at for four or five years and
we only have three.
[SPEAKER_03]: With zoning rules, you can really limit
the allowed businesses in an area.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why if your area passed
legalization recently, you really need to
[SPEAKER_03]: brush up on local politics and get down to
planning and zoning in city council or
[SPEAKER_03]: county commission meetings now,
because these rules are being decided for
[SPEAKER_03]: your area right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not involved, people who do give
a shit enough to show up, it's their voice
[SPEAKER_03]: that helps craft these rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's two people that really hate weed
for one reason or another, and one person
[SPEAKER_03]: that loves weed but is really
inarticulate, expect ugly rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know how to grow and you were all
about talking with city council,
[SPEAKER_01]: go down there, represent them,
tell them why their guidelines aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to work for a typical grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot recall buying cannabis in a
Pueblo dispensary since the legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: of recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last time I can remember
shopping in a Pueblo dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rarely shop in a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make sure to get out to the stores as
often as possible just to see what
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as supply goes, I'm not a lot
different than you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know you're a caregiver and he
does a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cascade shatter is tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That cough was brought to you by Irish
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and also our good friends at Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the good Pueblo news that we
screwed up on election night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our big blooper from that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I've got written down,
you can see it, it says Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to tell us about Maine,
go for it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maine voted to legalize recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vote passed by a very, very,
very, very slim margin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Statewide, it was 1,500, 1,200 votes or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very, very close.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anti-pop people forced a recount
costing the state half a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That recount is underway now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's paused for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've counted all of the cities in
county areas that the anti-pop people were
[SPEAKER_03]: sure we're going to give them the numbers
to reverse the vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: The outcome hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalization is still winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The really funny part of the story to me
is in Maine, the election rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you push for a recount and you get it,
the pro side and the anti side for
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever issue is getting recounted have
to send 10 volunteers every day to the
[SPEAKER_03]: recount office.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still costs the state half a million
dollars to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with using volunteers from the
campaigns.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anti-pop people in Maine can't get 10
people to show up every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The recount's taken a lot longer than it
should have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Election staffers have had to stand in and
cover for anti-legalization volunteers
[SPEAKER_03]: that weren't able to make it on time or
were late.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of days in a row when this first
started and it just happened again here at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the week, they didn't have
enough people show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, the pro pop people have had extra
volunteers willing to work and have been
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to work some longer hours to make
sure that this gets recounted correctly
[SPEAKER_03]: and accurately so that the recount is
still on track to finish up when it's
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the anti-pop people were so convinced
that they had this in the bag,
[SPEAKER_03]: so convinced that they had the majority of
people that they forced the recount and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half million of taxes to be spent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't even get 10 volunteers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many things are still being recounted
nationwide?
[SPEAKER_03]: Total election-wide, there's a bunch,
but it's all little stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's statewide issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: There aren't that many that are still
counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been four full weeks since the
election.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recounting is a huge process because it's
done by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Maine, the 10 people from each side
pair up and then they're given an election
[SPEAKER_03]: person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then those three people go to the table
and you look at the ballot and both of the
[SPEAKER_03]: pro and the anti people agree that that's
a yes vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third guy from the election commission
is there to make sure that the anti and
[SPEAKER_03]: the pro people don't fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: They play nice and follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes an insane amount of time on a
election night.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just funneling these fuckers
through a machine and you can do thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: a minute or thousands a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're Pueblo and you crash your
fucking shitty server.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the recount is an incredibly taxing
process, but there aren't that many that
[SPEAKER_03]: are still going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically by now, one side has gone,
okay, the vote clearly hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're down to just the tiny towns or the
areas that voted strongly one way or the
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've conceded at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anti-pot group in Maine is one of the
few holdouts that are still fighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this means, if you happen to listen
to the podcast and you live in Maine way,
[SPEAKER_03]: first shout out for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, get involved locally because in a
couple of weeks, when all this is said and
[SPEAKER_03]: done and it's official and marijuana is
legal, at best, you're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_03]: to local government officials who will be
saying over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, the vote was really close.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear what both sides are saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to give the anti-pot people
nine out of the 10 things they want and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to give the pro marijuana
people one out of the 10 things they want
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was a close vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't get on top of it now and
figure out exactly how these rules get
[SPEAKER_03]: made in your area, you're going to be
driving a really long distance to the only
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary in your area and it's going to
be crazy expensive to buy weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's Maine, it won't be that far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly have no idea exactly how big
that state is, but I don't want to drive
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 minutes to the weed store.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to drive 20 minutes to the
weed store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means then you got to drive 45
minutes home before you can smoke that new
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gave me a nostalgic feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when you used to go to the
dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I'm jaded, but I remember the
feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a fat dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for the chokes while Mike was
on his rant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember you used to go to the dispensary
and you'd be like, oh, you want one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've got the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a dab tool or the carb
capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you just don't use that email
because it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used it to be quiet and not use a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends at Elevate for
keeping me stocked up on fresh bangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Quinn's bangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that feeling when you would go to
the... I would do research online and find
[SPEAKER_01]: out what the hottest strains are in Denver
or in Colorado, and I would go find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was Bruce Banner, I'd go find where
they had some Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the strain that they had at the
Denver relief?
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they got the biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that started with a V.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vortex?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from TGA Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to the clinic on Mexico in
Denver, and I was getting the Vortex wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, how much do you have of
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd say this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they started setting limits because
of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Started setting purchase limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the first week they put those
purchase limits in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: The girls screwed up when we were there
and we still bought it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Brittany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember who that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a hookup like a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually when I bought my Hitman
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember the feeling I would get when
I would leave the dispensary with that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific strain that I was so excited
about going to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like almost the feeling when I was a
little kid and I'd get a new video game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever the new Zelda or Super Mario came
out and I'd like, oh, I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go home and show my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd go home and call one of your
buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing would happen with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd go home and call your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, bro, Mike, you got to come over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some biodiesel, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to come check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd drive over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd try to keep that jar closed until
you got here so that when I cracked it
[SPEAKER_01]: open, it was just fucking biodiesel in the
face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd grind a little bit of it up
and smoke it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'd be like that anticipation from
the car to the house of like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: God, just Mike, meet me at the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even make me wait, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed the drive home from picking up
weed for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that was like an hour and 20 minute
drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was stressful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, by the time you got home,
that adrenaline high, you're not allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to take more dams.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that adrenaline high from driving home
with a bag of weed and then sitting down
[SPEAKER_03]: grinding it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the sweet reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I finally made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like it was more of a reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to get higher then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you had that like, oh,
I fucking did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it used to be a struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be a mission, a stoner mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to find, do you have weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be two or three guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be that first guy you'd always
want to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was my friend with bad eyes and his
name started with a J.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in my crew, you know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit that guy first all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if he's got that sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I'd try a couple other dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you got to find out where they are,
if they got what you want, and if they can
[SPEAKER_01]: meet you somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to meet up somewhere and you
got to sit in a sketchy parking lot or go
[SPEAKER_01]: to a sketchy house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always had three or four people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on my way to work, I would hit up my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my lunch, if I ain't heard back,
I would hit up the other two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the end of the day, guaranteed,
one of them would have hit me back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'd go wait in the sketchy
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't miss those days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of miss that extra high from the
adrenaline and the drive and the
[SPEAKER_03]: anticipation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel that every time that I do hit a
dispensary now, or even when I come over
[SPEAKER_03]: and pick up from my caregiver,
when I get back in the car, there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: like, where am I going to put this
process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, oh, man, this is dank as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was the other day when I picked up
from my caregiver the last time when I got
[SPEAKER_03]: in the car, I was like, is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's my bag in inside is a proper
packaging inside my shoulder bag in the
[SPEAKER_03]: back seat of my car is still stinking out
the whole cab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, this is when the
adrenaline really kicks in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You roll all the windows down and drive
home in 20 degree weather anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make that meeting with the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as that bag and money exchanges,
now you're like, fuck, I just went from
[SPEAKER_01]: like, got to get this, got to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the deal going to go smooth too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to get this shit home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're somewhere or to whoever's house
we're partying in tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to make that drive and
your heart starts going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see a cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you're going to do is fucking see a
cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could be going the other way 90 to 90
miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Oh, fuck the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to like check yourself and be
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time you do get home and you
start getting that grin, you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You park the car because you're not going
to get pulled over once you park the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pretty much got home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take the keys out and you're like,
Oh, and by the time you unlock the door,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're almost, you can, your hands start
doing the grinder motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to grind this weed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you light it, your heart
is like, in this special place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that first puff just puts you like,
it's like a mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you just rescued the fucking
princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: That princess was sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm nostalgic for it, but I wouldn't give,
go back to it for all the money in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's nothing that could get me to
go back to having to do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love getting, I mean, on the off chance,
I get pulled over and I've got weed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love being able to go, is there weed in
the car?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got pulled over and the cop was 10
feet from my car before he goes to sir,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have marijuana in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he could smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just looked him straight in the face
and I said, yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably some weed in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to even try to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was, once I said, yes, that cop was
like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got pulled over, leaving a big
production grow that I was trimming at for
[SPEAKER_03]: awhile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, I didn't have anything on me,
but I probably had like eight or nine
[SPEAKER_03]: grams of just like marijuana juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not oil or extract or anything,
but like just the pulp from the family
[SPEAKER_03]: stem, like just in my shoes, just soaked
in through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I stunk to high heaven because I'd
been trimming for like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, are we in the car?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I work in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been harvesting all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that I stink the high heaven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, what's your all clear,
I had and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just see your badge and your
driver's license and your other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me run your, your car information.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good to have a nice night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just, just so you know, I can smell
you like four cars day behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could, I knew someone in front of me was
just stanking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like silver as a judge, just working all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really smell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bartender friend who's been
pulled over several times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I swear to God officer,
what you're smelling right now is my
[SPEAKER_03]: socks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sober.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I work at a bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to hate that as a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I did drink it for plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drank fucking plenty, but I learned not
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd be at the club cleaning up
or whatever and somebody'd spill some beer
[SPEAKER_01]: on you or on your equipment or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're in the car and it just reeks
that beer smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe driving home like, fuck,
I smell like beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so nice that it was literally the
only part of my life where I was way out
[SPEAKER_03]: of whack with legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been kicked out of
restaurants or denied service.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even kick me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, no, why don't you guys
go take a shower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I had someone walk up and they went to
do the, so table for three and they went,
[SPEAKER_03]: so take out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carry out the skirted heifer in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to say the name of a
restaurant, but, uh, and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire trim crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, I, the, we were going to
dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trimming and put down the trim to
go to dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was four of us that were working a
caregiver gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we like, we didn't have any of the like
protective layering that you wear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a production facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had like trim mashed into our shoes
and like stuck to our feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty much sat around the table,
just like this in our t-shirts and shorts
[SPEAKER_01]: and trimmed with rubber gloves on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would go smoke at a friend's
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause dude, it was so dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a friend that lived between the
grow and downtown is just going to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the apartment get wrecked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we drove right to the food place
and we go like, Hey, we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, you guys are going to eat
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, your table is
outside guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like four degrees out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our high ass is all eight outside
because they wouldn't let us sit inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the place was filled with families.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could see people looking at us
offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can smell your weed over the
burgers in the skirted heifer and
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skirted heifer serves a quinoa burger
that is marvelous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't blame restaurants when like,
I don't care what you do for work all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, if you're funky enough from it
to, to funk out a whole restaurant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you probably shouldn't go straight from
work to the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eat like, I don't care what you do or
why you stink.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't blame them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some restaurants back in the day when I
noticed before we had legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and it was a known thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would show up to restaurants with my
scuzzy looking friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know I'm not the cleanest looking
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bathe on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason they call us Wookiees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do look like Chewbacca's fucking
baby cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got dreadlocks past my ass,
almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fuzzy beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a goatee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a mustache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wore a crooked hat and a t-shirt and
Dickies and skateboard shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walk into restaurants and back in
the day, and I smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just constantly smell like herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm growing it, smoking it,
whatever, I smell like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would walk into restaurants and they
would kind of roll their eyes and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck, let's sit these weirdos in a corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the industry is the way that it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that kids that look like myself
and you and Kev bro, and whoever else used
[SPEAKER_01]: to roll with me to places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They treat us like fucking rock stars now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the Grammy Gatsby and I would go to
dinner in Colorado Springs, that waitress
[SPEAKER_01]: would be up our butts because they know
it's like, these are weed industry people
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get paid well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be super fucking nice to
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that they get paid well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get paid well now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the near future, in the very recent
past, they worked a job where tips or at
[SPEAKER_03]: least service was a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we go out to eat now, we
understand that the person serving us our
[SPEAKER_03]: food is making less than minimum wage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that if one or two of her tables
stiffs her throughout a shift,
[SPEAKER_03]: she's going to have trouble making ends
meet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if the service is good,
we always over tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as a community, we kind of take care
of each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was doing food service,
I could always tell which one of my tables
[SPEAKER_03]: or which customers also worked in the
service industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard every one of my food service
friends has said that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell who's like no one in
their family has worked in the service
[SPEAKER_03]: industry in a couple of generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can tell those fuckers too from a
mile away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it makes a big difference if
you're a server to know who to treat a
[SPEAKER_03]: little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when you take a girl out to
dinner and when the dinner is over,
[SPEAKER_01]: she starts gathering plates and sets them
at the edge of the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you're awesome, but you're
not at work right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can chill out, honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so rad to see like you're fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, I don't know how we just
ended up on this fucking route.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a random field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just talking about random shit
suddenly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of serious and lots of we're high to
table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a couple of notes that I want to
make sure to mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some other bullet points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hit, let's hit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to tease them because we're
going to do these in another podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even going to hit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, we won't do this one tonight,
but these are just coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody you touched on earlier and I
wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mail selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody sent me an email about mail
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked about breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about mail selection
in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about the difference
between lab testing and how the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: actually works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that reminds me that I want to give
another shout out to my friend Bo,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bo Nellis at the SPLIF podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot about growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot about cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do it from sort of a dude bro sort of
side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, we can't help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that that is that's who I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I please don't ask me to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not into the dude bro
culture, dab kid sort of thing that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got going on here, Bo Nellis has a great
podcast called the SPLIF podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she does it from a much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I described it kind of like as it's
learning cannabis from my kindergarten
[SPEAKER_01]: teacher, but she's fucking educated and
she is learning more and more as she goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: She will talk much more about specific
cannabinoid dosing for specific
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she should call some of her episodes
one hundred and one ways to use my
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, because I'm all about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about smoking some flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bo doesn't waste a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She uses every bit of cannabinoid she can
pull out of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not my style.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know someone locally that they were the
first person I ever met that was juicing
[SPEAKER_03]: raw cannabis like when they defoliate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take all that leaf material and juice
it as long as it should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: They toss the crunchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they defoliate and it's the
grain, they juice all that green leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she uses the stuff that she's
vaporized.
[SPEAKER_01]: She makes a tincture with coconut oil out
of that or a topical with coconut oil out
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She makes a cannabis lotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been making cannabis products for
her cats recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so if you guys want a different
perspective on cannabis, if you get tired
[SPEAKER_01]: of hearing our bro culture over here,
which I understand some people aren't into
[SPEAKER_01]: being called dude and bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They listen to a podcast all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've gotten this far in,
you must be into us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want some more, a different
perspective on cannabis from a very
[SPEAKER_01]: well-educated, professional sounding
woman, if you want a woman's perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: on cannabis, I highly recommend listening
to the Spliff podcast from Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does not pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking appreciate the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help the listeners out spell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is search for,
I'm going to open up my iPhone right here
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's right here on my podcast
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is simply, I got to get to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm scrolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is because it's Spliff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Spliff.
[SPEAKER_03]: As in smoke a spiff and pot not pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me like a week to find this
podcast just because I was hearing split
[SPEAKER_03]: and pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was the split podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this isn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spliff, S-P-L-I-F-F, the Spliff podcast,
P-O-T-C-A-S-T.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her name is Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's a great host.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a cool person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bo, one day I hope we get to take a dab
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make you take like a half
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you choke forever because that's how
I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys, you would appreciate the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like my show, I feel like you'll
like Bo's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has got 63 episodes up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am 30 something episodes in and they're
getting better and better as they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's really good at recommending specific
dosages of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's much, she doesn't over consume
cannabis the way that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's much more on the beginner
consumer side, which I'm not even bashing
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss my lower tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to do some really amazing
things with some low dose cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the world is on that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Chewbacca's freaking cousin and I like
to over dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to over medicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, but that's enough of a shout
out for Bo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I support that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to read an article
about particles per million and Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates on one of the next episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new PPM rules?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's something that needs
to be talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got an hour or two to stick around?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make sure I, cause we kill our
phones to do, we really try to dedicate an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour or more to you guys when we record
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of that involves killing our
phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have no idea what time it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 11 20 PM right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is six degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a 50 degree or better swing today,
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was nice, but windy when I was
outside getting shit done earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was, it was shitty cold a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got crazy windy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've like semi flipping windy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's put this podcast back on
some rails.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've walked onto a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no PM anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been careful this couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of the fun things.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things about Colorado is our
weather's psychotic and that you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: plan your grow for like fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave to go to this new project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I leave the house around six
30 in the morning and I'm wearing
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously pants with shorts underneath a
t-shirt, a hoodie, a jacket, a hat that
[SPEAKER_01]: covers up my ears with my dreads down to
keep me warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take off the jacket, the hoodie,
that hat I put on a different hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then for lunch, we go to lunch and
it's nice and warm outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put on shorts and skateboard shoes
and a t-shirt and tie the hair up and put
[SPEAKER_01]: a little small dread hat on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wear that for the second half of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I leave the facility that I'm working
with, it is a little after six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I put on again, all of the layers
every, and it's cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's colder than, than it was all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, we run the full weather gamut here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, daily it go, you get most of the
seasons daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the new people that haven't been here
for a solid year are sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How they're all, they're all walking
around with that head shit going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the growers that, that moved here
from far away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, even the ones that have been
growing cannabis one way or another for
[SPEAKER_03]: years are just fight for their first two
years here, trying to figure out how to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to control for, I mean, every day it's,
it starts out at zero and then it gets to
[SPEAKER_03]: 65 and then it's at zero again.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I not get PM in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I cure my buds in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I balance the humidity anywhere?
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a guy had to sign like $2
million worth of floor heating at one
[SPEAKER_03]: point to try to combat some of the weather
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fun watching different people
experiences, especially with, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've never seen an influx of people like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Traffic is getting shitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting people asking me like the,
how the fuck do people survive this
[SPEAKER_03]: question?
[SPEAKER_01]: When the fuck did they make highway 53
lanes up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I are going to turn off some
microphones and not do all of this to you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
episode 171 of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot that you guys listen for
171 episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying that I'm going to put out
some episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint said the same thing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying, I'm going to post old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep having more content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't feel the need to post all
them, but I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys keep asking for old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the emails you're sending me,
I am responding to them slowly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm getting to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't believe how many emails I get
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's trying to sell me shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just keep getting so many emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just writing a note right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you're looking at me like this is
part of the show, but it has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm getting to all those emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love making listener generated content
that lets me know that I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: something out to at least one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm hitting one person,
I'm probably hitting a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one person spoke up from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So send me those emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow Mike on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike just took nearly two hours out of his
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to take a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may record another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow him on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Nemo punk 15 on the Twitter and
Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of cannabis news that we
simply don't have time to work into a
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast or that is only a minute or two
worth of news.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of that stuff gets I post a
ton of that stuff to my to my Facebook
[SPEAKER_03]: page every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of lots of local cannabis news,
national stuff, international stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to talk about it a little
tonight and we just kind of went along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada is doing some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll write that down here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been posting a lot of stuff about
Canada, Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that floppy head.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of really awesome marijuana
news stories that we haven't gotten onto
[SPEAKER_03]: the podcast yet that are up on my social
media.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap this one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is a service that you can go to
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Patreon is a service that allows you
to contribute financially to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show will always be free,
free freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bring you a free podcast because I love
you and I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want cannabis to be legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you can do, you can help me pay
for the cost of my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is the website where this podcast
is hosted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost me a little over three hundred
dollars per year to keep that website
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am paying for that out of my pocket
right now because I love podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I've chosen to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to help me with that a
little bit, that would be sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to beg you for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is there for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can contribute as little as one dollar
or you can contribute as much as you would
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sign up for a monthly service to
where you can contribute one dollar per
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then every month on the first of the
month, you send one dollar to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will help me not have to cover
all the costs of the podcast out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that shows up for the show gets
a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to buy these little microphone
covers, these things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to replace these quite frequently
because you guys cough into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they stink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want people having to share
that funky shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made that trip to the store with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're really dying for old
content, this is a way to help make that
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason it's not up there right now is
because it would like double or triple the
[SPEAKER_03]: cost to maintain the web hosting to go
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we 171?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 171 now to go 171 deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of volume and storage costs a
pretty penny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make that promise yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody did make the proper Patreon
contribution and they said post an old
[SPEAKER_01]: episode asshole, that's the way to get me
to do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like money fucking talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Christmas time and money talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but I'm not trying to be that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying one dollar goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a dollar to contribute,
I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still want you to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still want you to grow amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do this so that when I'm old and too
tired to do this, like on our own,
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm hoping that enough people know
how to do it well that I can just hit a
[SPEAKER_03]: store and buy it at a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's all I want is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by the time I'm too old to fight this
fight anymore, that it's taken care of
[SPEAKER_03]: enough for me to just enjoy the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm asking for is help paying for the
website and buying these little microphone
[SPEAKER_01]: covers and water bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's all about if you can,
folks, Patreon dot com slash grow from
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be super awesome because I've
got one more super important thing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: need to include in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode comes out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, Miss JB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny Beth, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you have a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everything goes your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's all we've got for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you got anything else to wrap it up
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry Christmas, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever holiday it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what the number is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Christmas is the next big one in my world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But happy holidays, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you have a wonderful holiday season
and hopefully we have another podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: before the first of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're going to we're going to they're
going to hear from us again before
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes out love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18th, 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then that means we got seven dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be I'd completely forgotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my world, it's not Christmas until I
eat a specific type of Christmas cookie
[SPEAKER_03]: that a family member makes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't like it's just a thing in my
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: That hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as I'm concerned, it's like
August.
[SPEAKER_03]: The holidays are far, far away because I
have I haven't had that cookie yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be joining everybody the day after
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Merry Christmas, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Hanukkah, whichever one it is you're
celebrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what all of them are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to sound offensive,
but have a great holiday season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat some good food with your friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have some friends and family,
go to my Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll fucking chat down like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't send me pictures of your food,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all eat the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap this episode up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad they like it when we ramble
because dabs because dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody once again for
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Miss
Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cat licking your birthday cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody say, hooray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a cat licking your birthday cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can't read, so he does not know that
the cake is not for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's his birthday too, but the chance of
that is slim.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cat licking your birthday cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your birthday today.
