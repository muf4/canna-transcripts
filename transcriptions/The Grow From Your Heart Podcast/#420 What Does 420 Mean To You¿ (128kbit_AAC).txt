[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is time for episode 420 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy 420, everybody, and thank you for
joining me for this 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: On 420, Oregon Elite Seeds will be
dropping the first batch of Blue Raspberry
[SPEAKER_05]: Truffle, so make sure you check them out
at www.OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I
[SPEAKER_05]: am smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the day before 420, so I have been
smoking a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just smoked a big fat joint of
strawberry starburst flowers grown by my
[SPEAKER_05]: friend Kelvin Medina.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just took a big fat dab of grape
cola batter from Apothecary Farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I followed that up with a dab of Fortezimo
from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am heavily medicated, but what else
would you expect from a podcast recorded
[SPEAKER_05]: on 419?
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy 420 again, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am in the mood for podcasting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am in the mood to smoke some dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am in the mood to talk about cannabis,
and I am definitely excited to talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past few episodes and on my social
media, I have been asking my audience to
[SPEAKER_05]: tell me what 420 means to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this episode, we are going to talk
about 420 and what it means to you,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we will wrap it up by talking about
what 420 means to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ladies and gentlemen, smokers and
growers, roll up a fat joint, put some
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh water in the bong, or get yourself a
dab ready, and let's talk about what 420
[SPEAKER_05]: means to you and to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a bunch of messages saved here in
my phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go right to the first
message.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from, you know what,
I don't know if people want their names
[SPEAKER_05]: said on the show, so I'm not going to say
your name, but I'm going to send everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: a big thank you and give everybody much
love and respect for all of the responses
[SPEAKER_05]: I got from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The listener interaction means a lot to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this first message goes a lot like
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, 420 means community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means normalization, decriminalization,
and legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: I first felt that over 20 years ago as a
student in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our sociology professor told us that on
420 at 420, it's a tradition for students
[SPEAKER_05]: to gather on campus in the main lawn and
smoke together, celebrate together in
[SPEAKER_05]: public.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cops practiced tolerance that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a beautiful, progressive,
positive thing to take part in,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that sense of community surrounding
420 has always stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they wrapped up this message with a
green heart emoji, which tops it all off
[SPEAKER_05]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to this person, 420 represents
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that we're going to see that as a
trend in a lot of these messages.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that colleges were accepting to the
420 movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am really, I appreciate that some of the
professors and that the people at
[SPEAKER_05]: universities and colleges were kind of
tolerant and accepting and encouraging of
[SPEAKER_05]: the 420 movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find that to be quite progressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for this great 420 message.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from a good friend of the
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they want their name said,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Grimbold the Druid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's not his real name so we can
say that on the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: This message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Rasta Jeff, to me 420 and other
cannabis holidays are an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_05]: get together with my closest friends and
family and appreciate this wonderful plant
[SPEAKER_05]: in one of the best ways I know how.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking as much as we comfortably or
sometimes uncomfortably can handle and
[SPEAKER_05]: eating great food and enjoying each
other's company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the great work from your friend
Grimbold the Druid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Grim, thank you for the great message
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always appreciate having interacting
with you and I always appreciate your fine
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you guys follow Grimbold the
Druid.
[SPEAKER_05]: on Instagram and check out his fine,
fine cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: This next one comes from, let's see how
they signed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't use a fake name so I'm just not
going to give them a name.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says Rasta Jeff, as always I love your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it going brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I will do my best.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see no reason to stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't stop, won't stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to keep it going man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason to shut this down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes on to say, so I've been smoking
for the past 16 years of my life and 420
[SPEAKER_05]: has always been a day to hang with the
bros and smoke in celebration of this
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see more community coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last three messages have all talked
about hanging out with our friends during
[SPEAKER_05]: 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he wants to smoke in celebration of
this amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he goes on to say, even in
prohibition land, the love is still there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on 420, me and the dudes will have your
podcast going and smoke one for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy 420 brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey bros, hey guys gathering around
smoking and listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for bringing me to the party.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I get to go to a lot of really cool
420 parties this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to say I was at a lot of parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys heard me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he ends the message.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, happy 420 brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, happy 420 to you too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he continues one last sentence.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, as always take a fat dab and hug
your mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, shout out to white Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey white Mike, you got a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may hear from white Mike toward the end
of the episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy 420 to white Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, our friend that sent us this message,
you know who you are dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to coming to the party with
you and your bros.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also bring some ladies to the party,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of party is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from, you know what I can
say, this guy's name.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from our friend Squishy McRosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, hey Jeff, I just wanted to share
a 420 moment since you asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, 420 means friends and family.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told you we would see a trend in here,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, 420 means friends and family.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long ago when I was 17, my dad had a heart
attack just a few days before 420 and I
[SPEAKER_05]: had to travel to Vancouver for him to have
an operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I missed a 420 celebration I had
planned with my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really hope in the end of this
story, you tell me that your dad is okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm hoping for right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes on to say, the operation went
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh good, I'm relieved already.
[SPEAKER_05]: The operation went well for my dad and
everything checked out okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can continue this message in peace now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, when I returned home,
my friends had shown their support by
[SPEAKER_05]: planning a two day 420 makeup party in my
honor and they called it, and he says his
[SPEAKER_05]: real name, Fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just gonna say Squishy McRosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Squishy Fest and use his Instagram name
here so we don't bust out his real name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that is pretty cool that your friends
gave you a two day makeup 420 party.
[SPEAKER_05]: You missed the one day main party so
instead you got two bonus days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone had 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you got to have 422 and 23 or
whatever and it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is cool that they did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave you your own little fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is some really cool friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep them around, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the message continues.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, so now every year as 420
approaches, I'm reminded how thankful I am
[SPEAKER_05]: to still have my dad in my life now 17
years later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man, I'm glad he's still around with
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're enjoying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious if you smoke with your dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really curious if you've crossed that
line yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, and how great of friends I had to
do that for me when my family was going
[SPEAKER_05]: through some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is really cool that your family
pulled it together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your friends, they are your family.
[SPEAKER_05]: They pulled it together.
[SPEAKER_05]: They threw you a 420 party.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took your mind off of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best part is that dad's still around
so that is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this year for 420, if you haven't
already smoked with your dad, I dare you
[SPEAKER_05]: to spark up with dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got another message.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go through these messages
quite quickly and then we may play some
[SPEAKER_05]: more audio messages and then I'll talk
about what 420 means to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one, they did not leave an alias.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it says, feel free to use my name.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I love your show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you for your show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes Monday another Friday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes Monday can be a kind of a pain
in the ass for some people and that's why
[SPEAKER_05]: I put out shows on Monday because it makes
Monday suck a little bit less for those
[SPEAKER_05]: people who have to go to a job they don't
completely enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's cool that I'm making your Monday
another Friday.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_05]: The message keeps going.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, you are smart, very smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then here's the part we're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, 420 is to me a day that I'm going
to take off work and literally wake up in
[SPEAKER_05]: bed with a joint rolled and a hot nail and
keep myself medicated all day and hang out
[SPEAKER_05]: and smoke with my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got another guy that is going to spend
420 with his friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, friends that smoke or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he also says, maybe go for a walk or
cook something or both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cook something, grub down, and then go for
a walk.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he says, shout out to you and White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come take a dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he says, you guys are both awesome
and feel free to use my name from Brant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Brant, thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for sharing what 420 means to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This next message came in on my email.
[SPEAKER_05]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: 420 brings me back to a special day.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Timmy and I saw you on the Dude
Grow Show on YouTube and I have grabbed
[SPEAKER_05]: some of your beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am in New York City.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, but my 420, my first 420 was when
I was like 19 and I'm 32 now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and my homeboy got some purple,
beautiful buds that I've never seen
[SPEAKER_05]: anything so pretty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years ago, my best friend overdosed on
heroin three days before my birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is a rough story already.
[SPEAKER_05]: So last year I went and spent all my money
on a trip by myself to the San Bernardino
[SPEAKER_05]: 420 High Times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to stop myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to say San Bernarduby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Went to the San Bernardino 420 High Times
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said also, what a mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: You feel like you were ripped off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to touch that statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you say, but stay positive,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, stay positive that they were at least
able to have that event.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that it did get weird that
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things didn't go perfectly, but at least
you got to go have a good time,
[SPEAKER_05]: be around the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he goes on to say, I guess I've just
shut down about growing, but it cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: just makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives me something to be happy about
and makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel close to my homeboy on the day of
420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that 420 can bring back that
connection to your friend that's no longer
[SPEAKER_05]: around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that you're surrounded by other
good friends this year and that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking something delicious and that you
guys are laughing and remembering that
[SPEAKER_05]: your homeboy was there with you and had a
bunch of good times with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're doing all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, if you want to hang out, send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take a virtual dab together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know how you're doing, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everything goes marvelously for you
for this 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we can redeem that San Bernardino
420 because I know how that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll get better, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got another message.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one came to us from the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one says, 420 means to me it is time
to fire it up, bro, even if you smoke all
[SPEAKER_05]: day every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is from our friend James Butterson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to James Butterson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always the first one to leave a comment on
the YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have another one here in the
phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I currently shift work between 60 to 90
hours a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, are you a fucking machine?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a break, my man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to one day only work 20 hours
a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day you'll have to, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he says he'd like to work no more
than four days and be off every afternoon
[SPEAKER_05]: by 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he says 420 is when I get to chill
and relax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, you work too hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you work hard for that 420 break.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet that is nice after 60 to 90 hours of
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is putting it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you really do deserve that smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're smoking for
recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's medical at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: You deserve it, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for the update on what 420
means to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Podcast World, those were all
of the listener submissions about what 420
[SPEAKER_05]: means to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is time for me to tell you what
420 means to me, and then we will play a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of audio clips from some of our
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does 420 mean to me?
[SPEAKER_05]: 420 means a lot of things to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been involved in participating in
celebrating 420 for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably actually discovered the phrase
420 early in high school, probably around
[SPEAKER_05]: eighth or ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: My first fish show was in 95, and I know
we were talking about 420 at fish shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 420, I've been celebrating,
talking about participating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in the 420 scene since the early
90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: 420 has evolved and changed into a lot of
different things over the years as I have
[SPEAKER_05]: grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first discovered 420, like most of
us, it was kind of the way that me and my
[SPEAKER_05]: bros would tell each other, you want to go
smoke some weed without everybody else
[SPEAKER_05]: knowing that we were going to go smoke
some weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't last very long.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're a high school kid and you
think you've got some code, it's not good
[SPEAKER_05]: code.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a high school kid and you're
listening, you should not be listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've got some code that you think
your teachers or your parents or somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: know that means we're going to go do
something stupid, everybody knows you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to go do some fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your code's not working.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 420 was our little code that me and Rob
or me and Chris or all of us would be
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd say, I think it's pretty close to
420.
[SPEAKER_05]: And other people would look at their clock
and say, it's only 115.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what these dumbasses are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the other people that knew,
anybody that was cool, sometimes too many
[SPEAKER_05]: people that weren't cool, would look at us
and go, oh yeah, it's 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would come with us or they would
ruin our 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: So back in the day when it started,
that was our way to say, let's go smoke,
[SPEAKER_05]: bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost time to go sneak away,
go smoke a ball together, go get the crew
[SPEAKER_05]: together and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then people started catching on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it started getting really,
really popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then around the same time that 420 got
super popular and super commercialized,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was entering the commercial cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is where my view, my stance,
my opinion of 420 shifted a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you work in the commercial cannabis
industry, if you were in the production
[SPEAKER_05]: side, if you were in the commercial side,
especially if you were in the packaging
[SPEAKER_05]: side or the retail side, 420 can be a
headache.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is almost, a lot of my friends,
this is the week of 420 and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_05]: to see a lot of my friends because they're
working overtime.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're stuck at work getting prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're running 420 sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of my friends that are running their
own businesses are away at conventions
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to manage their business.
[SPEAKER_05]: 420 gets hectic when you were in the
cannabis business and you've got
[SPEAKER_05]: responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: About two weeks before 420, we started
getting prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have got to roll all of the pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: People come from all over the damn planet
to Colorado and they all want a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have got to start rolling pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the employees that don't have
something to do are put on a pre-roll
[SPEAKER_05]: station, start rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of pre-rolls to be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of preparation like
packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the concentrates you buy,
they all come in ridiculous amounts of
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be weighed by somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be packed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be packaged by somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody has to do all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sell a lot of product over the 420
holiday season.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody is putting those products
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Around the 1st of April, we start and
they'll be continuing through April 20th.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then on 421, they have to start doing it
all over to restock the shelves because we
[SPEAKER_05]: wipe it clean on 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great for the industry, but for the
people who are part of it, it is a
[SPEAKER_05]: headache.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like the Christmas rush for the weed
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like the mall at Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like wherever you go to buy fancy
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Best Buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the mall.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Guitar Center at Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is hectic.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that are working there have
that deer in the headlights sort of look.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just wish they could get a break so
they could go smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is hectic.
[SPEAKER_05]: The traffic starts about two weeks before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything starts going on sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: The prices change.
[SPEAKER_05]: New customers start coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is more chaotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of changes your whole opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, a lot of times as it gets closer to
420, there'll be a fucking DJ at your
[SPEAKER_05]: work, DJing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spending terrible music that you're trying
to work over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got while you're trying to sell a
gram to some guy from Texas that doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: know anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm talking about how terrible it
is, but once you've done it a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: years in a row, you kind of you think,
oh, God, it's 415.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go to work this week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what it's like once you enter
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you work in the retail side,
you kind of just want to punch yourself in
[SPEAKER_05]: the face from about April 10th right
through about April 22nd.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I've kind of shifted my position in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still work with a lot of grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still do a lot of things in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not so involved in that retail side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not so involved and immersed in all
the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of more I've become sort of a
hermit in my old age, which is fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: great with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The less people, the less places,
the less drama and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stick to the point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kind of changed my stance since I am
not so heavily involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to be anywhere that I don't
really want to be at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: 420 now, I miss what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss when me and my bros could nudge
each other and go down for a little 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't got any weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking let's go do some 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the pagers back in the day?
[SPEAKER_05]: Your pager would go off and it would have
your friend's phone number and then it
[SPEAKER_05]: would just say 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it would have a couple of other
numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew that if you put these four
numbers, that was the Burger King over on
[SPEAKER_05]: the south side because those are the four
numbers for the pay phone and the Burger
[SPEAKER_05]: King.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you text me, you say 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last four digits of the phone number,
the pay phone at the Burger King,
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're going to go smoke some bowls
in the parking lot at Burger King pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll meet you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss those days.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being a sneaky stoner was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that it's not even, I don't know,
everybody's just smoking weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even like sneaky anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something, I don't know, something about
hiding it made it a little bit more fun
[SPEAKER_05]: and I miss that code and that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I just missed that time period
because we were fucking 17 and didn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: to worry about anything, but I miss that
part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now being the opposite end of that,
being an adult where I don't have to hide
[SPEAKER_05]: 420 from anybody at this point,
the law, my parents, the teacher,
[SPEAKER_05]: nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can smoke a fat dab and walk into
class and as long as you can stare at the
[SPEAKER_05]: teacher properly, they don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you paid your tuition and you
showed up, nobody even cares.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little, it's like when your
favorite band puts out that album and you
[SPEAKER_05]: go, oh, yeah, I'm probably not going to
listen to them so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of that same feeling for 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm smoking down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 419 and my eyes are red.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little goofy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a great 420,
but it is different now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an old guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not into, I don't need the code.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's fun to go to the shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is great to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the communal feeling of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little overhyped in Colorado
because it is almost like they know all of
[SPEAKER_05]: the businesses know it's 420 time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a burger joint that is selling a
burger with CBD and the sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody is advertising blatant 420
advertising, any product that could be
[SPEAKER_05]: used by a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pointing it at you with some 420
style advertising in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a little overdone in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to smoke with you every day at 420
and especially even harder on 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about the 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have a shirt that looked like it
had the 7-Eleven logo on it, but it
[SPEAKER_05]: actually said four or had the number four
and said 20 on the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had it real big on the back everywhere I
went.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the hippies love that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I love your 420 shirt, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would smoke together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in the future I evolved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the one that looked like it said
7-Eleven, but it actually said 7-10
[SPEAKER_05]: because 7-10 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we talk about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is in a nutshell my feelings about
420 and what 420 means to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate all of your contributions and
your emails, your messages, your YouTube
[SPEAKER_05]: comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you reached out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for telling me what 420 means to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a couple of audio clips I'm going
to play from friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to tell us what 420 means to
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get there, let's go old school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about where 420 originated.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all got our own ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all means something cool to all of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the originators of 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the early 70s, in San Rafael,
California, there were a group of dudes
[SPEAKER_05]: who called themselves the Waldos.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have heard of these dudes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a normal group of dudes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every day at 420, this group of dudes
known as the Waldos would meet up at a
[SPEAKER_05]: spot after school and guess what they
would do?
[SPEAKER_05]: They would get down on a fat joint or a
fat bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just happened to be 420 because that's
when everybody got out of class and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: when they could all get together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So their code was, hey, you want to get
together for a little 420?
[SPEAKER_05]: And from there, it really caught on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the Waldos were also known for being
deadheads.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the phrase 420 traveled quickly through
deadhead culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deadheads love to have some sort of a cool
catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything to say something without saying
the real word in deadhead culture is
[SPEAKER_05]: always a really catchy thing to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it spread like wildfire through the
deadhead culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 80s, deadhead culture started
becoming like pop culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just becoming mainstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that introduced 420 to the mainstream,
which made it spread through the high
[SPEAKER_05]: school kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it became even more popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I discovered it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I discovered it in high school and through
the fish community at fish shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I said 420 at a fish show,
everybody definitely knew what I meant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big shout out to the Waldos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to blow all of their story.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a website and their website is
420waldos.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are more interested in the Waldos,
I encourage you to check out their
[SPEAKER_05]: website.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot of archival evidence that
can show how far back the phrase 420 went.
[SPEAKER_05]: They show how far back they've been
calling themselves the Waldos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they show how they link themselves to
the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a really fun website if you're
interested in the 420 culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've told you what 420 means to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have talked about what 420 means to a
lot of our listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have edumacated you on where 420 came
from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I think it is time to play some clips
from some of our friends about 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, happy 420 Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am asking everybody what does 420
mean to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: You, like myself, have been in and out of
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been around for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you're an old dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you tell me what does 420 mean to
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, it's a community holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was younger, I went kind of wild
with it, but that was in the heyday where
[SPEAKER_00]: tens of thousands of people would gather
up at CU Boulder on Norlin Lawn or when
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of people or a
hundred thousand people would gather in
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown Denver at Civic Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: No concerts, no promotion, no food
vending, just a giant massive smoke out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the battled prohibition days because we
could in mass numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of a civil protest, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only real act of civil
disobedience I got to participate in in my
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still a great rite of passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I vividly remember the first time I
went up to CU Boulder and participated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke out on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like people everywhere, cops
everywhere, people with cameras
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The school really didn't want the event to
take place, but there's nothing you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: when 10,000 or more people decide that
they're going to show up at a place at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time and do a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Power in numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: How old were you at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first time I went up there,
I was 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was like in 2000 when there
was no medical yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali had been medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado had just passed medical,
but it didn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no doctors, no cards,
no MED, no medical marijuana program yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything was black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything was illegal basically,
unless you were one of those rare med
[SPEAKER_05]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were almost no medical patients in
the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2001, 2003, 2004.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you were 18 and that's what 420 was for
you then.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sort of a holiday, a cultural
holiday, and also a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mass protest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beautiful thing about those events and
their original incarnation was all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these people would show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would commit what was considered a
serious crime together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking pot in public was not something
that didn't get you handcuffed and dragged
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still is that way in a lot of
places.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you take it for granted that it's not
like that still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time it was, I mean,
it was a serious crime and it was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: absurd that this was a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having all those people come
together, hang out for a couple of hours
[SPEAKER_00]: in the afternoon, like it's usually half
decent on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's brutal cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get lucky this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been beautiful the last couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first couple of times I went up to
420, it was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just astounding to see all those
people gather, hang out, chill until like
[SPEAKER_00]: 418.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole crowd kind of stands up
and starts cheering and hooting and right
[SPEAKER_00]: at 420, everybody lights up and there's
just this massive cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by five o'clock, everybody's
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like 15 little groups of ones
and twos walking around picking up trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no traffic snarls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no bodies on the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pandemonium later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just an awesome act of civil
disobedience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I went down to Civic Center
the next couple of years, as I used to go
[SPEAKER_00]: every year, we'd take the light rail into
downtown and just watch the show all
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seeing 100,000 people all light up
right in front of the state Capitol is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you should definitely see
in person if you haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I stopped going the more corporatey it
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there was a promoter and concerts and
a couple of terrible vending attempts,
[SPEAKER_00]: it lost its appeal or it lost its hook for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see how it has gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to talk about this when I
say what it means to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to step on your part here,
but I see how it has definitely gone from
[SPEAKER_05]: the thing that was what the bros did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of the down-low thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The potheads were doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now 420 is an event.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go rent space and we say, hey city,
we're going to hold a 420 rally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has definitely evolved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see how you're talking about corporate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mike, did working in the cannabis
industry change your outlook and your
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion on 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in the industry, especially on
the retail side, 420 is just a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like working Christmas if you've
worked regular retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pandemonium, just endless lines,
whatever sales going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the whole week leading up is just
nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two weeks this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it's been two weeks ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like every holiday is getting drugged
further and further down the calendar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is added to the list of holidays.
[SPEAKER_05]: In most states, they don't get the extra
holiday that we get here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every store has a sale right around
420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any store that could apply, the Gros
store, the restaurants, like the
[SPEAKER_05]: restaurants where stoners go, the pizza
joints, all those places are having a sale
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They may not blatantly say 420 sale,
but we all know all the advertising is
[SPEAKER_05]: green.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the week before and after 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really neat to see that all of
mainstream culture is kind of catching on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disappointing example of that that I
just saw was Carl's Jr CBD sauce on one of
[SPEAKER_00]: their burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, you're fucking failing at
life right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's even real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that real?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred percent real.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one location in Denver and for
420, for $4 and 20 cents on 420,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get one of their burgers in their
secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're infusing fucking CBD for that one
burger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get one of these burgers and
take it to a lab and have it tested and
[SPEAKER_05]: see how much CBD is in this burger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're advertising it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the next big point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a meme on social media that said
folks in Colorado be like, my Subaru runs
[SPEAKER_05]: on CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is absolutely fucking accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Mike, we are all stepping all
over your little segment here in this
[SPEAKER_05]: show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to give you a couple of
brief moments to tell us what 420 means to
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've talked about it as you were a
youngster, as you started off in your
[SPEAKER_05]: activism, you went to a peaceful civil
disobedience, kind of a protest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some good old footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to like to stand in the crowd and
do the slowly turning a circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to do that too, being a tall guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then it became kind of commercialized.
[SPEAKER_05]: You quit going to the events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for a couple of years, like myself,
you were tied up at a location,
[SPEAKER_05]: either working retail and then a couple of
the years you were working at The Grow
[SPEAKER_05]: with me for at least one 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that you're kind of an older dude,
you're a parent, you're not really in the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry per se, but you are still on the
fringe.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tertiary.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were kind of in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right near it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on the, you're industry adjacent.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does 420, what is 420?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does 420 mean to you these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's just another day in my
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any plans to hit up a big
event or to go up to Civic Center or any
[SPEAKER_00]: of that nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just way too much at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the kids are chilling at 420,
you might run to the dad's safe room and
[SPEAKER_05]: take a quick puff at 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, then not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I'm missing the tradition of
like a family dinner or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot of other holidays where it's
like, if I just stopped doing
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanksgiving, like there's other parts
than just stuff about the holiday that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: With 420, it's just another day in my
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's fun that the community has a
date to focus on and kind of go all out
[SPEAKER_00]: with, but most of the stuff I see now,
I just shake my head at.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that was a great kind of an overview
of your beginning of 420, the middle of
[SPEAKER_05]: 420, your retail 420, and now the
definitely old man Mike 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good perspective there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a holiday on the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a time code.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in high school, it was cute to
write 420 on your notebook and shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but since I was 15, it was as good as
wearing a shirt that said pothead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was confused about the number 420
except the most ignorant among us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were confused about everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for joining me for this quick
420 segment in the 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are celebrating 420 here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's nothing left to do but to turn
off these microphones and let's enjoy some
[SPEAKER_05]: 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to smoke some flour and some
dabs here in honor of 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ladies and gentlemen, I'll be right
back to keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining me, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, yo, big up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Coot Dogg from the Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my name is Pato Banton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're giving shout outs to say what
420 means to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go first.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 to me is a day where people get
together to celebrate the magical herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a peaceful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say it's a day of peace around all the
world where people can relax and fire up,
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy however they prefer, or it's edible,
or if it's a smoke, or even if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: without any ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to feel the vibes of 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what 420 means to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, Pato Banton, 420 is something that
happens twice every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in the evening at 420 and once in the
morning at 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every year, annually, 420 is when the
whole world come together to celebrate the
[SPEAKER_03]: healing of the nation and to remind each
other that we should take away the stigma
[SPEAKER_03]: from this beautiful plant and remember
that it is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a natural herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nothing wrong with partaking
of this beautiful medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, big up Rasta Jeff from Coot Dogg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what 420 means to three of my
favorite people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got White Mike in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Big Coot from Mystic Roots in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we got Mr. Pato Banton,
and they're spreading the love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big thanks to all three of them for their
contribution to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Podcast World, I think that is all I have
got for you for this 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you again for listening to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you had a wonderful or are having a
