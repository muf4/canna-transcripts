[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for episode number 144 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_05]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_05]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys once again for
joining me.
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to
the show, The Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look a little high.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a beautiful smile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm super stoned today, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've eaten close to like 500 milligrams
today, so bear with me, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard you took a little nap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for getting out of bed to come hang
out with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The listeners like having you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Directly in front of me is the man,
the myth, the legend of Mr. Bobo
[SPEAKER_05]: Blastrico, also known as Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, how was Portugal?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you do any Portuguese drugs?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually finally got asked for offered
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm turning down the music.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you guys could see the look of
disappointment in my face.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were in Portugal where everything is
legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was with my mom and my stepdad,
so like, actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was with my mom when I got offered hash,
and my mom was like, oh, what did that guy
[SPEAKER_04]: over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, the guy with the polo
shirt offered me hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, your shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I got right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you got some BHO, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got some turpex over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, hashish, hashish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad you made it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to be back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm disappointed you didn't try any
Portuguese drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: How was Florida?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: That awesome Florida-ish feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soup feeling, soup balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you brought a hot date back from
Florida with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: My four-legged awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the dog's name again?
[SPEAKER_05]: Layla.
[SPEAKER_05]: Layla.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome home, Layla.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you're back, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dabs, dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: To my left, my nine o'clock-ish position,
you guys, you know who he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Ramble King.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike is back on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining me, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everyone is perfectly high for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoroughly baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we're a little too dabbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we're not dabbed enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I've had too much caffeine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're doing all right today.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be a good fucking show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to settle in and do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main beef of this podcast,
the main heart and soul is going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody sent me an email and they wanted
to know, since not a lot of our friends
[SPEAKER_05]: here work in dispensaries and I've been in
a dispensary environment for the past
[SPEAKER_05]: several years, we got a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to know about what's the
craziest shit we have ever seen in a
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary or at a smoke event.
[SPEAKER_05]: But before we get to that, I want to do a
couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do Kip's first because his name is
Kip and that's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never met anybody in person whose
name was Kip, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to be cool as shit if your name is
Kip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Means you got cool parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kip, shout out to Kip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found Kip on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, I have some plants that I need
that I had a friend take care of during a
[SPEAKER_05]: trip and even though on average he's a
decent grower, he put my 10 inch plants
[SPEAKER_05]: with his that were a few feet high and
didn't raise them up and they were
[SPEAKER_05]: severely stretched, almost eight inches
between nodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, on average I'd waste them and
start new stock but I'm currently out of
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and clones due to the trip and I
don't have any good candidates for clones
[SPEAKER_05]: other than the tops of the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's your answer right there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes on to say, if it wasn't the last
of the genetics, I had, I'd waste them or
[SPEAKER_05]: pull the tops and clone it but I'm
wondering if you had any quick ways to
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe get a plant to put out some shoots
so I have something to clip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm running 600 watt HPS at the time,
age old newts in dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually use nectar of the gods but I
can't see spending a fortune to raise
[SPEAKER_05]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any help would be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put them into bigger pots and top
them and they'll start shooting out more
[SPEAKER_05]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them a high phosphorus diet with a
lot of nitrogen and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll spit out more shoots.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a product called Bushmaster
that'll make them shoot out more shoots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put them into bigger pots, feed them a
good diet and they'll shoot out more
[SPEAKER_05]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them plenty of light, give them
plenty of space, top them, do some topping
[SPEAKER_05]: and pinching techniques.
[SPEAKER_05]: But your main answer to your question is,
what's left there is the tops of those
[SPEAKER_05]: plants, clone those, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clone those right away, get those healthy
tops cloned in a cloner, labeled,
[SPEAKER_05]: get them rooted and then take really good
care of those new clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the solution for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kip, I appreciate the message on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any more questions,
please, send them to me on Facebook or hit
[SPEAKER_05]: me up at growfromyourheartathotmail.com
and I will read your messages on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm searching for an email I've
got.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do one more email and then
we're gonna talk about the crazy shit that
[SPEAKER_05]: these folks have seen in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's looking at me like,
I wanna talk about dispensary shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys start thinking about it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your stories brewing in your heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some interesting shit you saw at MetaMars,
some crazy shit that's happened to you
[SPEAKER_05]: over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you've been to dispensaries and
seen some crazy shit also, Bobo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get those stories cooking in your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we talk about the smoke shop too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes, that's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that stuff, secret sash, cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all fair game in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, this email though.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is, I think I already said his
name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I was supposed to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said his name out loud once already.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may edit that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, what's going on, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I burned through all the episodes on
Stitcher in about a week and I have to
[SPEAKER_05]: wait painfully from week to week for each
new episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are 10 episodes available on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to my website,
ireageneticscolorado.com, there are 100
[SPEAKER_05]: episodes available on there for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last 100 episodes are up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want more episodes other than that,
send me an email and I will consider
[SPEAKER_05]: sending you files of the shit that's not
up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do need to post some of the older stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some stuff that was really useful
that has phased out.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of the episodes were really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those early episodes had a lot of
heavy grow information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may go throw some of those out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like mid-week episodes, just as bonus
repeats again.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, but anyway, he says,
I have found that, let's see, being from
[SPEAKER_05]: an illegal state of Pennsylvania,
I cannot take your advice in the literal
[SPEAKER_05]: sense due to legalities.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I have found that what is good
for the cannabis plant is also good for
[SPEAKER_05]: some vegetable plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adding organic nutrients such as compost
teas and trimming techniques like
[SPEAKER_05]: lollipopping have done wonders for my
tomatoes and hot peppers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that's applicable to your outdoor
veggie garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes on to say, I also welcome the
great advice from White Mike on the legal
[SPEAKER_05]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently in Pennsylvania, the Senate and
House unanimously passed a bill allowing
[SPEAKER_05]: for restricted hemp production for
university research.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's currently awaiting the final
signature from Governor Tom Wolf.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a dude named Tom Wolf.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also says, I know we are miles behind
Colorado, but I guess we need to start
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: He continues with, my wife and I will have
the pleasure of visiting your fine state
[SPEAKER_05]: next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll probably be by the time this
podcast airs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to email him before that,
but he says, we are overjoyed and have
[SPEAKER_05]: been counting down for weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will of course be flying into Denver,
into the Denver area and beginning our
[SPEAKER_05]: adventure from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: My first question is, do you have any
recommendations for recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries in the Denver region?
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure we establish a
reputable place with products that are
[SPEAKER_05]: grown from the heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a second question is, do you think
you could do an episode on how to
[SPEAKER_05]: troubleshoot and solve different signs of
nutrient burn and or nutrient
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a potassium deficiency,
you would see these signs as opposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen deficiency, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would make a great
informative episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro, that episode is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch ch-ching screenshot of your email so
that I'll remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do that episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he says, anyway, before I keep
rambling, don't worry, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say, you are very good at
your career and give great advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ever have any photography
questions, don't hesitate to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be awesome to someday meet you
and do some dabs, but until then,
[SPEAKER_05]: give my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Best of luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he says, you can just call me Fats if
you decide to read this on the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks, Fats.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will edit your name out at the front
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had two questions for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: He asked about a dispensary, a
recreational dispensary recommendation in
[SPEAKER_05]: the Denver area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I unfortunately have no clue where to tell
you to go because I don't buy recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow and then I'm a master grower at a
shop or I just go there and pick up
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers on that employee discount and
smoke those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody in the room have a
recommendation for a reputable dispensary
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Denver area?
[SPEAKER_05]: The clinic has always been one of my
favorite places to send people.
[SPEAKER_05]: The clinic has a rec side.
[SPEAKER_05]: The clinic is a great place in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their flowers are always quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't guarantee anything about the...
Oh, look, we got a text message from
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody in the other room listening and
they say Natty Rems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So go to Natty Rems.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say the only thing I
can really recommend is places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been into Natty Rems and it's
actually a very nice... They take green
[SPEAKER_03]: solutions, but like... I was going to say
green solutions as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been over a year since I've been into
a shop in Denver and I honestly can't
[SPEAKER_07]: remember if the last two were rec or med.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say fly into Denver, get to your
hotel, get on your phone, download the
[SPEAKER_05]: Weedmaps app and then just look what's
near your hotel and then read reviews for
[SPEAKER_05]: a few of those places.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't hit just one place, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to a couple of places, check them out,
get the experience because every place is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to have a different vibe of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be different music at the
spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The music is loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's reggae in your face as soon as you
get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a real salesy environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want you to buy, buy, buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are set up to where it's like
impulse buys right where you need them and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's got that kind of flow to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Green and healthy on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the owner, he wanted to set it up
more with the art gallery sort of a feel
[SPEAKER_05]: and it does have that sort of a feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more spread out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more spacious.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's artwork everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so every dispensary and the quality of
product from the two shops is amazingly
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the selections are different too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, every shop is going to have its
own vibe, its own selection, its own way
[SPEAKER_07]: of doing things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially if you're from
Pennsylvania, it's worth hitting several
[SPEAKER_07]: just to check out the different ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're also going to want to make time to
hit allusions glass gallery downtown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to white Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're definitely not to,
yeah, it's somewhere you're going to want
[SPEAKER_07]: to stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just make sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure it's part of your trip and be
careful smoking in your hotel.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may think that because you're in
Colorado, now we can smoke out the hotel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Negative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that you've got a marijuana
friendly room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're worried about calling and
asking the hotel, just call it from your
[SPEAKER_07]: phone and pretend like you're lost or
coming next week and want to know what
[SPEAKER_07]: their policy is.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be happy to explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to say, if you're going to
smoke in your room or do something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, I would highly recommend looking
into things like the smoke buddy and the
[SPEAKER_03]: like scented candles from smoke shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that are actually like,
yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go out on the balcony if you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you, you know, if you set off the
smoke alarm, they will charge you the 250
[SPEAKER_05]: or $500 cleaning fee, depending on how
bougie the hotel is.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll charge you for that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the smoke buddy, a little vape
pen.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your, aren't you repping a new vape
pen company?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the name of that pen?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, you can shout them out on the
show since you're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, kinetic products is what they are on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their website to order stuff will be up
and running on the 25th of this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, and I don't actually have the
exact website for that yet, but you can
[SPEAKER_03]: check them out on Instagram at kinetic
products and they have a, um, wax pen that
[SPEAKER_03]: has a quartz coil in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's been bragging about it for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spell kinetic for us, because I think when
you say kinetic, I see with a K,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's the Colorado C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's C a N N.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: See the ultra did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's C a N N E T I C dot products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Help out our listeners a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Kip, your second question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, first question was dispensary
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make an episode on troubleshooting and
solving problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually got it written down.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a really in depth.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those long episodes I've got to
write out and really plan well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there's a lot of stuff to think
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I got to find a starting point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the starting point is printing out
that chart that shows you all the leaves
[SPEAKER_05]: with fucked up problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to want to include in the
show notes for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did just smack the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smack the shit out of that mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a bad kid beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, what am I supposed to call you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fats Fats, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for sending us an email when you're
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Contact me, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Message me somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be like, I am about to land in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a busy man, honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Denver is 125 miles from my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 60 miles from my work, but you never
know because I go to Denver and do some
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug Benson might be in town.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If Doug Benson have secret sessions,
it's the way it could be.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be here during a secret session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, the dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you looked at me, I was like,
I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going shot at the secret session.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't talk about it, but it may be here
during a secret session.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, either way, bro, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know that you're coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, email me just like you did and let me
know a little more accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your details.
[SPEAKER_05]: This episode will probably come out by the
time your trip already happened,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm going to message you and make sure
that we get in touch with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope you hear this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you hear us talking about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, your trip that already happened to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the future to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone in the room.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tease this part at the start of the
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to talk about the craziest shit
we've ever seen in a dispensary or at a
[SPEAKER_05]: smokey event or at a cannabis cup or at
the dab lounge, some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Lindsay's taking a drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna let Mike go first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, uh, Mike and I ran, let's give you a
little background story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike and I ran the first and only
dispensary in city limits in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this dispensary was located right at
the middle of the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the east side of our town is hood as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there are, there's a lot of face
tattoos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's a lot of pocket knives.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of use guises.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's not, it's not the prettiest place
to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all those people came and then,
uh, we had people from all parts of
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was back in the purely medical day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was just anybody who had or wanted a
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_05]: There would be, we had probably 10 seats
inside the place and there would be people
[SPEAKER_05]: in every chair and then standing outside
waiting to come in still.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a receptionist and myself as
a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I hired Mike as a backup bud
tender cause I couldn't get through
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my second week, we, we hired the
security guard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, we were really inventing shit as
we went along, just making it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry was being invented is there
was no everybody was no badge.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no time clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was barely other dispensaries that
you could go check out and steal stuff and
[SPEAKER_07]: ideas from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you now, if you're thinking about
opening a dispenser, you can just go to a
[SPEAKER_07]: hundred of them and pick like the 10
things you like about your favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then there wasn't even that the boss
would pay me to drive to Denver on the,
[SPEAKER_05]: if I was going to a concert, he'd be like,
here's some money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop at a couple dispensaries,
pick up some advertisements and some
[SPEAKER_05]: product and see what they got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd just throw me money to go do
recon work and come back and kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: adjust our shit to be a little bit better
every time we went crazy old dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so Mike and I ran the first place and
I had some fucking crazy experiences in
[SPEAKER_05]: that place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote down just to, just to give you a
tease of my list, threats, plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: gun chat, trades and gifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the gifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember the lady that gave us the
piece?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what I meant by gifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, this older lady kind of looked
like maybe a 55, 65 year old, a better
[SPEAKER_07]: biker chick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably 30 though, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sometimes the wind's mean,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's normal transaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing surprising or interesting about it
until right at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, you two are sweet here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: She reaches into her purse and pulls out
this little plastic bag with this black.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like old bubble gum and pocket
lint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was black and in like stringy,
I guess is how I would describe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, here's some opium for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just kind of walked off.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just know what fake skin looks like
from Halloween.
[SPEAKER_05]: That thin layer of fake skin.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it dries on your skin, it kind of
looked like that folded up in a
[SPEAKER_05]: cellophane.
[SPEAKER_07]: That place was bizarre.
[SPEAKER_07]: The, my favorite people there were the
kids coming there to sell, sell weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just wander in with a terrified look
on their face with a little messenger bag
[SPEAKER_07]: that they were kind of hugging to their
side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they go, is there a manager around?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just terrified.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause this was in the beginning when like
you could have as much marijuana as you
[SPEAKER_07]: had medical cards for, but it was still
400 an ounce, like end of story.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're hauling around a lot more
money than they're comfortable with on
[SPEAKER_07]: their hip.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as most people are concerned,
that's a major crime.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just wanted into a store to try
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's a weird experience, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'd get like three of those,
four of those guys a day sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a lot of friends from those folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them were really talented.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would offer those guys 800 a quarter
pound or 3,200 a pound to take it or leave
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get 900 out of me if it was
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of those people would just look
at me like, oh, like they wanted so much
[SPEAKER_05]: more for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then, now wholesale commercial herb
is about $2,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could find it if you're looking
for like some outdoor commercial,
[SPEAKER_05]: like rec weed, like some, ooh,
do I want to drop any dispensary names?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, the stuff that you'd get over there
at that one spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a hundred bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably like $1,500 a pound,
you know, 1,400 a pound to get that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gotten way cheaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Mike, what's one of your
fucking craziest memories you have from
[SPEAKER_05]: Metamoros?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many bizarre ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: The you two falling down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Edibles, one of the managers,
owners would make, they were all homemade.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were all delicious and they were all
insanely potent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was sweet and she would kind of
insist that you eat like one of everything
[SPEAKER_07]: when she'd bring in a new batch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so by like mid day or lunch,
you'd be like too high to form words
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And watching a coworker tumble down a
switch back stair and then land like in
[SPEAKER_07]: sprawled out face first in front of a
lobby full of customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they just pop up and they're
like, who's next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Quickest way down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Haulin' all the plants out of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we loaded up an RV or was it the RV
time or the time we did the U-Haul truck?
[SPEAKER_07]: When we got shut down, it was just,
you have to stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were like, okay, we'll stop then.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've got all this shit in the store.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we do with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically all of the plants that were
in the grow were just, if you want them,
[SPEAKER_07]: hauler.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for like half a day from like noon
to midnight, randomly people would pull up
[SPEAKER_07]: out back, walk around, knock on the door,
come inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd pick out the half dozen or dozen or
whatever plants they had paperwork for and
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Load them in whatever vehicle they had and
they'd bail.
[SPEAKER_07]: My backyard was packed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of the stranger experiences of
my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a lot of fun to be like,
at one point there was a U-Haul and the
[SPEAKER_07]: dude had, was a caregiver for like 11
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we sat there and went through his
paperwork for like 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_07]: double checking everything and then
loaded.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh fuck dude, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time we got that back of that
U-Haul loaded, I was sweating so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We moved a lot of plants around at that
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Recently I had a dude show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just in bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, maybe 350 pounds, maybe 45 years
old, but like life's been rough.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's like a lot of great,
yeah, this is the new digs, the new place.
[SPEAKER_07]: He comes walking up to the door and
already security guards like, uh-uh.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like halfway to that door,
we noticed that like, there's a good
[SPEAKER_07]: wobble to his walk too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he gets to the front door.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, there's the weed store.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the security guards like, no sir,
you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: The security guard's like, well,
A, you're barefoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: B, you're not wearing a shirt,
you're topless.
[SPEAKER_07]: And C, you're drunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, sir, you have to leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, no, this is the weed store.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he like goes to push past my armed
security guard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the security guard blocks his way
and is like, sir, you really can't come
[SPEAKER_07]: in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you're barefoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not wearing a shirt.
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes, Jesus was barefoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like that doesn't let, mean we're
going to let you into our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, there's, that's just random
stuff that's popping in my mind right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've taken some dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's stranger shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just keep seeing you fall down those
stairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, one time I was sitting at Metomar and
the reason I mentioned the thugs that used
[SPEAKER_05]: to come in, uh, there was a bunch of
normal people and then like a group of
[SPEAKER_05]: like four or five youngster gangster kind
of kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were all talking about their gun
collections.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could see the white folk just like,
just cringing, just like, we're all going
[SPEAKER_05]: to fuck and die in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see it on all their faces.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the funniest fucking
things I remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro, you're not, you don't wear,
uh, Chris, you don't work in a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm sure you've seen some whack ass
shit somewhere to smoke club or
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People just see the craziest shit inside
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people think just because it's legal,
they can just say whatever the hell they
[SPEAKER_04]: want.
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't a law free zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's just, we have legal weed stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you go in with your friends and
then your friend passes you all the money,
[SPEAKER_04]: you say, yeah, I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay shaking her head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, no, you have to leave now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some guy come in the dispensary the
other day and he was like buying an ounce
[SPEAKER_03]: of flour and he was, he said something
about it was for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, this is for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like you, you can't say that in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is your one warning,
you know, and he was like, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gifting him this bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, no, you're not allowed
to take your medical card.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't anybody's birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go and buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just get the members different.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's different rules for rec and
medical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you're in a medical shop,
you have to play by the height of the
[SPEAKER_07]: medical rules is, is legally it's
essentially you're, you're at a pharmacy
[SPEAKER_07]: and the pharmacist is like, here's your
pills.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're like, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give them my cousin,
Billy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do that two or three times and the
pharmacist is going to go fuck you and
[SPEAKER_07]: your pills.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you ain't getting these and I'm
calling the cops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you actually sign a member agreement
at green and healthy wellness that says in
[SPEAKER_05]: bold letters, I will not redistribute this
medicine to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what our main concern there
is that you're not going, nobody needs to
[SPEAKER_05]: get that medicine from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they need that medicine, they have the
means to get that product legally
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need to be, we don't need to be,
you don't need a middleman for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need to know about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If once you take that cannabis home and
take it out of the black package that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've sold it to you in and some time
passes, we don't know what happens after
[SPEAKER_05]: that and we can't care, but don't tell us
about it and take it out of our fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what you do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's, now it's your cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, whatever can happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, you can give your cannabis to
people, but not the stuff you got a green
[SPEAKER_05]: and healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got something to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see your face now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a poignant message to the world from
hanging around the smoke shop with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hang around the smoke shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: People just thought it was a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was still the oddest thing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, you know, it's actually
really odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really doesn't have anything to do
with weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working in the smoke shop one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Saturday and me and my manager
were both on the floor and I had some guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was showing him some hand pipe and I
was, I guess I should explain that I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have hair on the sides of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have the sides of my head shaved
and I was like, I had my head down and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was like pulling out a pipe to show him
and he reaches across the counter and he
[SPEAKER_03]: takes his hand and he runs it across the
side of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just was like, um, please don't
touch me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I didn't think that I had to make
that an out loud rule, but please don't
[SPEAKER_03]: touch me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to have this guy, it's similar
lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy used to come in and he was kind
of a nightmarish customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like he did not typically have a pleasant
smell to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was typically dressed and like took too
much acid, went to Goodwill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wondered if that's who you were going
for.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he had a car that didn't match his
wardrobe and odor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a better kept up, like early
2000s, like Corvette, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's shopping and he buys like $6
worth of something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or whatever, not a lot of money worth of
flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his, my coworkers stapling his bag
shut.
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes, I just got new carpet in my trunk
and the two girls I'm working with are
[SPEAKER_07]: like, what an odd thing to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of look at them and they're
like, oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, you two want to come outside
and smell it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was like three heartbeats where
all three of us that were at work that
[SPEAKER_07]: night were like, he just fucking said,
he said, smell it, not look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just so smooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jess goes, no, sir, we're actually,
we're not allowed to leave the store until
[SPEAKER_07]: after closing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a rule.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just smooth as anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I half believed it when she said it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was she ever a stripper?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like a stripper line.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: In what world would you go out to
someone's car and even, wait, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, okay, sniff, sniffing is
really funny, but like in what world would
[SPEAKER_03]: you even go and look at someone's new
carpet in their trunk?
[SPEAKER_03]: You obviously just killed somebody and
threw them in the trunk and got your
[SPEAKER_03]: carpet redone back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you want me to go out there and be
the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you should keep it a secret.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell anybody about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out this trunk I just cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty high back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It throws on the UV light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, you can't even see the spots
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that one stands way out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember when people used to bring
plants into Metamar that had problems?
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd bring up what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He brought a big old plant and a fucking
like a Walmart bag in a pot and a potted
[SPEAKER_05]: plant with leaves just sticking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He carries it in and he opens up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all coated in powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, get that the fuck out of here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we got plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told him what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that's that's only
solvable by fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with as bad as that is, that just
needs fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got to have just.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember you like just kind of mumbling
under your breath like, fuck, dude,
[SPEAKER_07]: now I'm going to have to shower like three
times before I can get my garden chores
[SPEAKER_07]: done tonight because just one fool after
another had brought in a potted plant with
[SPEAKER_07]: like a paper trash bag, like gently set
over the little stand up support sticks so
[SPEAKER_07]: that they could kind of hide what they
were, what kind of plant they were
[SPEAKER_07]: carrying in public view as they brought it
into the dispensary to try to get us to
[SPEAKER_07]: diagnose it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking people opening up shit with spider
mites on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: People leaving our place with clones and
not giving a fuck just carrying.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sold clones in cups and you could buy
if you're plant count was one hundred and
[SPEAKER_05]: forty.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd sell you one hundred and forty
clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't give a shit back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people would leave with just trays of
clones in their hands, like six inch tall
[SPEAKER_05]: plants in cups, just carrying them out to
the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we didn't care at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember one guy coming back like two or
three days in a row, maybe six trips total
[SPEAKER_07]: and buying like two clones at a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I when I asked him like,
what the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was he goes, I keep sending them
out back so they get used to the light and
[SPEAKER_07]: the birds keep eating them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, dude, you're on clones like
seven and eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: Come up with a plan, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a shotgun, like get some chicken wire,
put them inside like something set up by
[SPEAKER_07]: the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of bringing things into the
dispensary, I'm friends with the person,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm not going to say where any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But somebody came into a place that I work
and brought in a product that they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: us to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the entire dome on the pen was just
like this color in the bright orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, you know, the like dome
open globe, like open glass could not even
[SPEAKER_03]: see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, you can't have that
in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are on camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have people pulling vaporizers out of
their pocket left and right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a weird bag of returned ones that
we've got like the receipts and like as
[SPEAKER_07]: much documentation as we can because we
send them back to the company for
[SPEAKER_07]: replacement units.
[SPEAKER_07]: But half of them are like burn out and a
tiny bit dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we keep epic records on all of that
shit just so that there's no that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: daily occurrence.
[SPEAKER_07]: People pulling shit like that out of their
pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, at the place you work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to be careful how I ask this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you get a prize for wearing a small
shirt?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends who's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some of the random shit that I've
seen happen at that place.
[SPEAKER_07]: How crazy it's it is during that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sometimes we'll see a couple
hundred people in a day and weird things
[SPEAKER_07]: happen when it's that crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the summer, if you shop at Mike's
dispensary and you're in like a bikini,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a good chance you'll get some
gifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of free t-shirts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny when you watch all the dudes
that work there, the older manager dudes
[SPEAKER_05]: try to stumble over Mike to get to the
fucking young customers in the bikini.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are titty bees.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to tell a ridiculous story
that happened to me one time when I worked
[SPEAKER_05]: at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: This probably be the last one of these
crazy stories for this episode because I
[SPEAKER_05]: thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one day I was working at work at the
dispensary selling good old weed and it
[SPEAKER_05]: was myself and my receptionist is I guess
what she would officially be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name was Tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: She probably weighed 90 pounds and was
afraid of the wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like she was, she was a very timid little
chick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one day a normal customer,
there were regular customers that would
[SPEAKER_05]: come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: She wasn't even a lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to call her a lady because
of what she did.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a female.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a large female and her husband was
a dude who was about equal size with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would come in often and I knew
who they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one day she came in early in the
morning and said, how much is an ounce?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told her an ounce is this much.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time at that dispensary an ounce
was $320.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, if I come up with three,
will you do it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And since she was a regular customer,
I said, don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll hook you up for 300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, if you send your old man in
later, I'll do it for three for him also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they got a baby and they switch
shifts and I just know how that should
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she comes back later and she's got like
200 and I don't even remember how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she comes in like way later.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to close and she comes back in
and she's like, hey, sell me an ounce for
[SPEAKER_05]: like 250 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, nah, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do it for three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any less than that, I'll get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like begging and I'm like,
I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, let me go out to the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: And see what I can come up with.
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes out to the car and they're out
there for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause tree can see the window and see
their car.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, they're kind of yelling at
each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be back in in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, cool, give them a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he came in and she's like, I need to
see your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you have to check in every time you
come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, nah, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk to that fucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, so I'm about to go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it was me that he wanted to
talk to.
[SPEAKER_05]: He pushes past her and comes back to the
bud room where I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we got the bud room in the back of
the building.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can get privacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, motherfucker, you told my
wife that if she sucks your dick,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'd give her an ounce for 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, bro, I'm not interested in
your wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't give her that anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd never fucking say that to your
wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you guys are regulars here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the fuck would I do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I'm not even trying to be
rude.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was not attractive.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was way, way not in my weight class.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was no thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like why would anybody want her to suck
their dick?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he's going off on me, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, I'm going to fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's kind of a big dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's my size.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm fucking six, five.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to be at least six, three or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's straight in my eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was on the other side of the counter
and he kept hitting the counter and the
[SPEAKER_05]: counters glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, he's going to break this
counter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I got to fucking figure this out
quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And tree kept asking, do you want me to
call the cops?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to call the cops?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, no, I don't want the cops at
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the last thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to bring that to this
business already.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got mace and I've got some scissors
within reach, like right within reach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was starting to get shaky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was getting that, like,
I'm about to fight this motherfucker is
[SPEAKER_05]: like the feeling that I had in my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, this shit's about to go down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, you motherfucker,
you told my wife that if you sold her an
[SPEAKER_05]: ounce for you'd still announce if she
sucked your dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then tree starts yelling, I was right
fucking here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All this between tree and I and the office
in the bedroom is a tapestry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, that's all that was a black
tapestry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, I was right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't fucking say any of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I can hear everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, when he turned his head,
I grabbed the mace and the scissors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the mace with my right hand and the
scissors with my left hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by now his girlfriend came in too and
was backing him up and left.
[SPEAKER_05]: They left the baby in the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I told him, bro, you're kind of
threatening me and I'm not sure what to do
[SPEAKER_05]: about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to fucking mace you and then
I'm going to stab you and then I'm going
[SPEAKER_05]: to make your fucking wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to call the cops if you
guys don't get out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And tree looked at me like, wow,
I've never seen that side of you because
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody just knows me as this peaceful
dude that grows weed and smokes a ton of
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fucking as a bud tender and I'm all
laid back and I show up like five minutes
[SPEAKER_05]: late and I'm fucking cool with everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now she sees me about to spray
some dude in his face, stab him with
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking trim scissors and then go after
his girl with the mace.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the only thing that saved me from
fighting was when I told him I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: spray you, stab you, and then I'm going to
spray your girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_05]: She looked at him like, um, I don't want
to get mace, baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: This idea ain't working no more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's when it all kind of started to
fucking cool down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where you work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll find you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I'm here every day,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, but that was honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fucking like, I've got a lot of
adrenaline right now just telling that
[SPEAKER_05]: story.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought that dude, it wasn't long
after that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the security guard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was like, bro, I can't be here by
myself with fucking 20 pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We hit because at that point, I mean,
we were brand new and we were getting like
[SPEAKER_07]: two calls a month from people that would
say like random horrible shit into the
[SPEAKER_07]: phone because we were stealing their
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they didn't like the idea of a
dispenser.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like we should have the
security guard long before that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the security guard we got was
pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day I was driving down Northern
Avenue, one of the main streets here in
[SPEAKER_05]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I see the security guard.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're both going to Medemar to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the bud tender.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got to get there at the same time as
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we open right when I get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're driving down the street and he
pulls up next to me and he goes,
[SPEAKER_05]: damn essay, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was smoking a big old fat ass joint
on my way to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I took a big old hit off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I'm high enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I go, roll down your window.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he rolled down his window all the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was in the right lane.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in the left lane.
[SPEAKER_05]: He put his hand out and I threw that
fucking joint from my car into his
[SPEAKER_05]: passenger window directly into his hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: He caught that fucker and didn't have to
make adjustments and just hit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were so happy when they got to work
that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like Voltron just united,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We came together on that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you guys, I told my craziest
story that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't cover events.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people black the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend Katrina took, she took a dab and
she looked at me and she goes,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so hungry and just fell the fuck over,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I caught her, but we stayed in a really
swanky hotel the night before and they had
[SPEAKER_05]: free lotion and she lubed herself up in
all the damn lotion.
[SPEAKER_05]: She used it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tried to catch her and it was trying
to like, trying to catch a fucking slid
[SPEAKER_05]: right out of my arms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to catch her like three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I finally got her all awkward and
Tony was with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I go, Tony, just pick her up and put
her on my shoulders, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I was holding her just like,
she was like a wet noodle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he spun her around and threw up on
my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I got her and I spun her around and I
told him, pour this water on her face.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just gave him water and he was like
pouring water into her mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she started drinking it and woke up
and I set her down.
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes, how long was I asleep?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was all pale and shit for the rest of
the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to feed her twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: This dude from Texas one time,
I took a fat dab, a fat, fat dab at the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one that they did at the new
location.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what's the new place?
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver mart did a fat location.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did a big old fat dab and this guy came up
and he was from Texas.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's all, what y'all doing right there?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, it's dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, damn, I heard about dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: They done that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get a dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried to give him a little dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've told this story on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to give him a little dab and he's
like, nah, I saw you do one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I don't think you want to
do your first dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a Rasta Jeff sized dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, give me a damn old dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you're going to get a dang
old dad, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I hooked him up and that dude took
a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the time the last of the smoke hit
his lungs, I'm pretty sure part of the dab
[SPEAKER_05]: came out of that sinus part of your eye,
like where your eye and your nose meets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke came out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke came out of his ears.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke came out of his nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke came out of his mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you took off his pants, I'm pretty sure
some smoke was coming out of his butthole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that dude was just, he just blew up
with smoke and he looked at me and
[SPEAKER_05]: vanished.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where the fuck he went.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what happened to that dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just levitated into nowhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was gone, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit was so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Went back to his car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Left instantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drove right back and went and slept in the
car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the way that ran out of his car was,
what the hell was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What did that wookie just give me?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he drove to Texas and told
everybody about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rasta wizard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rasta wizard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes there'd be a nice offering you a
tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, don't, you don't have to take your
relic dabs just cause I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mean you need to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my friends at Turbex for the
lovely work with the Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shouldn't even talk about it on the show
since it's all sold though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys want to talk about these Terps
for a minute?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been talking about the Terps for a
couple of few episodes now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm amazed that they're still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wiggling my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: My hat is pulling my dread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to fix that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a large container, but it lasts
for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: These Terps are amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys get to try the Lemon G?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get to try the OG Kush?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I tried the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we may have to do some dunking and
zipping here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that still the Ghost Train?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to lick the bottle if
you want to taste that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried the Ghost, but the Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard about, but haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Ghost was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about ways to use it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like pouring the OG Kush Terps
onto solventless hash, like the 120 micron
[SPEAKER_05]: cream or blue sherb hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just press out.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how this one's pressed right here?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a little patty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pour a little drip on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Terps are pretty thick and kind of
viscous, so you got to pour quickly or
[SPEAKER_05]: it'll run down the side of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to learn to get the angle going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love pouring it on the fucking
solventless.
[SPEAKER_05]: I poured some onto just a little piece of
shatter the other day so that I had a
[SPEAKER_05]: whole piece of shatter with some on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, some dripped onto the oil
slick, so I was dipping it up using
[SPEAKER_05]: shatter and solventless and whatever I was
smoking, just rubbing it in on the oil
[SPEAKER_05]: slick.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite way, honestly, is to get a
small-ish dab and then just dunk it right
[SPEAKER_05]: into the Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't even go too hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit of Terps and then just
smoke it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually dropped a little bit of the
Ghost Train Haze Terps directly onto the
[SPEAKER_05]: e-nail head.
[SPEAKER_05]: It made the next five or six or eight dabs
taste real terpy, but it didn't last as
[SPEAKER_05]: long as I had hoped for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay, you work at the store where we're
selling this medically.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are these going for for a quarter of
a gram now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 60.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's 60 bucks a quarter gram
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 65 for non-members.
[SPEAKER_05]: 65 for non-members.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be a member.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get the blue sherb.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get the cream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just come and get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Terps are fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get the Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a rec shopper, you can get the
Terps at Natty Ram's call before you drive
[SPEAKER_05]: because I don't know what they've got.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, when this episode comes out,
they could be cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could be like, Terps, that was a few
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good fucking luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: But shout out to the crew that's making
the Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Evo Lab crew because
we've seen a lot of really cool cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: products come out in the past year,
past two years, past whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one might be my favorite,
the Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be the newest, greatest thing
to come out in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Mike?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been some stuff recently that's
been impressive, but this kind of took it
[SPEAKER_06]: to another, a new place.
[SPEAKER_05]: A very fun new place.
[SPEAKER_05]: A very connoisseur level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like getting, I do like playing with the
distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like taking the distillate, the just raw
distill.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just 91% THC and you get a little
tiny dab of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like to dip it into the OG Kush and
then maybe put it in the lemon G after
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe rub it on the ghost train
haze and just see what the different
[SPEAKER_05]: mixtures do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that, honestly, that got old quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: A few times it was like, it was like
mixing jelly bellies.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you're like, eh, I did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been having some fun mixing random
hashes together, playing with the
[SPEAKER_07]: different flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Combined.
[SPEAKER_07]: Combined it was good, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking down this table, folks,
and there's like 12 different varieties of
[SPEAKER_07]: hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's three different vials of Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four vials of Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four vials of Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just can't see one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's insanely delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indistracting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a dabalicious table.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got this beautiful little pancake
of solvent list that's been taunting me
[SPEAKER_07]: this whole episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you smoke that whole thing,
you may not speak for the rest of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's like at least 10 mic dabs on
that little pancake, which is funny
[SPEAKER_07]: because that's like a quarter Jeff dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: But easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd put a drop of OG Kush Terps on it and
that'd be one fabulous dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, you started talking about
dripping Terps on it and I looked down and
[SPEAKER_07]: went, ooh, got sexier.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where it combined.
[SPEAKER_07]: It came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like given.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like giving hash a boob job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put some Terps on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like putting wheels on that
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put some rams on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spinners, but they look nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't got to be spinners,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one needs spinners anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, kind of a 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they whistle.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Bobo, you got anything to add
to this wonderful podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, thanks for the furniture table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you guys check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a big car?
[SPEAKER_05]: Big cartel dot burniture dot com or is it
burniture dot big cartel dot com?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So burniture dot big cartel dot com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Support it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Order a custom table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a bad mo fro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Contact him for custom art.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole bunch of email furniture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check out the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long ago did you hook me up with that
email table?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been over a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still works.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't got no problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: The coils are still good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the workhorse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like one of the one of the
originals too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The paint needs a hug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got some miles on those tires now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we've done a lot of videos over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I sent it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent it here to make sure it got put to
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like literally that was probably
the third or fourth one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I'm going to send it to Jeff
because I know he's going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got a lot of use.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a lot of miles on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The coils are still working.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm amazed because I've used a couple
of coils on this unit here in the same
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: These coils aren't as good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I like the ones that look
more like a microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, if you're buying an email,
get the one with the coil that looks like
[SPEAKER_05]: a microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like an XLR cable,
not the other one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it doesn't look like an XLR,
that's not the one I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lins, are you all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just thinking to myself that I
remember when you were making that table
[SPEAKER_03]: in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I remember you and I trying to figure
out how you were going to paint it and you
[SPEAKER_03]: doing the tape on the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tape when you pulled it off or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the reason you pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You painted it because you originally were
going to do something on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you pulled up the paint,
that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you, when you put the tape
down and you pulled it up and you were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, and you were like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to do Jeff's thing on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going balls deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a really dope unboxing video on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I watched that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually at her job, I think,
or I was walking in your job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we watched it when I was at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was like driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, Jeff just got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: The video may be on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't promise you the unboxing video
could be up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Lindsay needs a nap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, sunshine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry we woke you up for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Five or six hundred or four or five
hundred?
[SPEAKER_03]: Four or five hundred.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still doing all right though, for five
hundred milligrams.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say I had a power
nap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere between like eight and twelve
hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_05]: A THC during the last secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was on what?
[SPEAKER_05]: 421?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the last one we had in May.
[SPEAKER_05]: May 23rd, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: May something-ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in May.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what date it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: That day I ate a whole bunch and then
somebody gave me a thousand milligram
[SPEAKER_05]: edible at that event.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ate that the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually ended up getting one of those
and I'm mad because I've been wanting to
[SPEAKER_04]: like eat a thousand and I didn't cause she
ended up like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, wait, let me, let me tell you the
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave him this thousand milligram bar and
I was like, yo, surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got you one that you've we've
been like talking about forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does this idiot do?
[SPEAKER_03]: He opens it like he's like, oh,
sweet, grabs the grabs it from me,
[SPEAKER_03]: opens it up, breaks off two of them,
throws it in his mouth immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no warning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, he looks over at me all
wide out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh, why did I do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a habit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea why you did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let me just try this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, why did I eat this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to eat all of this right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kinda wish I would not have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ankle weights on your brain, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that how you described it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, on Facebook I said it's like ankle
weights for your brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so hashy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that was the most hashtastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: My teeth were sticking together.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were making this like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, half.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I would pull my teeth apart,
they would make a clicking noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half pieces were really hashy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was eating it while I was driving,
so I was just pounding on their hashy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: They told me Max, what's the fucking
dude's name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Max, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me he put a gram and a half of
shatter in each bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means I ate a gram and a half of
shatter in a chocolate bar that was really
[SPEAKER_05]: no bigger than an iPhone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's like six pieces or things?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's eight pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, wait, if it's a gram and a half,
then isn't that more than a thousand?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, because that's something that we
should talk about on the podcast when we
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot more time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a gram of hash, if you test this
hash, this is not 100 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is probably in the high 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they threw a gram and a half in there
and they're calling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a much truer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they thought they couldn't be tested
by the MED and they couldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: They aren't an MED product.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are just somebody's basement brew,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Home concoction.
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss the the days when anyone could use
lab testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We only had those days for about two and a
half, three months.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a beautiful chunk of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Aston and John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to them and the and the.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck, I totally wish I could remember the
the chemist's name, the scientist that I
[SPEAKER_05]: met when I know his name.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right on the tip of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as we quit recording, I'm going to
yell his name out loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, he was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: The scientist I met at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: He really taught me a lot of stuff in the
short amount of time we hung out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steep Hill is the first group.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, way back at the first Kush Khan,
they had like the saddest little booth at
[SPEAKER_07]: the show with the coolest information
pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were the first people I really saw
breaking down cannabis testing past THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were advertising pesticides,
heavy metals like 12 different
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just it was one of those things
where you saw, oh, that that's where the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry is going to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to open up all new avenues,
ensure shit potency jumped 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quality went up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, an incalculable amount right after
the lab showed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Johnny Trill and Trill
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had their shit tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero traces of any pesticides and all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to those kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a test like that on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the same test I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was getting around to I haven't eaten
edibles since that thousand milligram
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm a little scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fell off the horse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't got back on yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I've been highly into edibles
lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever since I went to Florida, I
overroasted myself with them when I went
[SPEAKER_07]: to see Deadpool and I've been going real
late since I just needed a reset for a
[SPEAKER_05]: little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just needed a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably eat a whole bunch of edibles
again at the next secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if this podcast comes out before
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this podcast will not be out by the
time secret sesh happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it did, we will do a review of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone looks at their phone to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many days until this episode?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many until secret sesh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do quick math on our fingers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know, but check out secret
sesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way to get into a secret sesh is
to follow the instructions on the
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_05]: So either if it's already happened or not,
check out secret at secret sesh underscore
[SPEAKER_05]: CO on Instagram.

[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a simple email.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to follow the instructions.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people do something stupidly
wrong and then like, why didn't I get my
[SPEAKER_05]: tickets?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we go look at their email,
like, cause you didn't put your name on
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't show your ID like you're
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you just got to do this shit
properly and you will get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the secret session.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just went quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got any more useful information for
this podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have like a thousand stories I
can tell you of just obscene things people
[SPEAKER_03]: have said and done, but you know,
like when people ridiculously blatantly
[SPEAKER_05]: just flirt with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's, there's that there's,
um, when I was working in the smoke shop,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had someone come up, come in and be
like, Oh, are you the trap queen?
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my boy sloppy for making a
really great joke in the dispensary the
[SPEAKER_05]: other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to repeat any of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't go there, but that's fucking
golden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out.

[SPEAKER_05]: Proud of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Proud of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a youngster when he moved here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like sloppy was kind of just getting his
feet on when he moved here.

rambling so that we can hear people cough.

the show.

[SPEAKER_05]: I do have some of the Lemon G Rude Boy.
