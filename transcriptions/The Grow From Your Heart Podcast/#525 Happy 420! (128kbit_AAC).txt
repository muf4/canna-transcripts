[SPEAKER_00]: It is my pre 420 celebration I'm getting
heavily medicated for this show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am dabbing on crescendo live batter from
Green Dot Labs The crescendo is a cross of
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D, I-95 and Mandarin cookies on the
package The flavor is described as heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: chem gas and cookie dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will agree with all of that When you
crack the jar open you are greeted with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very pleasant cookie dough sweetness Then
that is followed by a gassy chem punch
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really enjoy As soon as it hits the
dab nail, I get a really nice chem gas
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor The aftertaste is a little bit
chem-y with some sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz is perfect and very desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is perfect concentrate for me I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought as much as they would let me have
at the dispensary Big ups to my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Cannabis Exchange for the great
concentrates all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am opening up the jar I'm getting
punched in the face with that delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie dough smell And as I look at it,
it looks like a beautiful the texture the
[SPEAKER_00]: color is perfect It's a beautiful golden
yellow dollop of cheesecake batter right
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of the container Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stop and take another dab,
but we're gonna continue on with the show

[SPEAKER_00]: on the screen and of course I did include
that link in the show notes for all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 420 and it is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quiet around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually at this time of the year I would
be scrambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be getting seed packages and
advertising and menus and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be loading up the car I'd have a hotel
booked somewhere and we would have some
[SPEAKER_00]: really kick-ass event to go to and hang
out with all of our cannabis consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: friends all of our industry friends would
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a weird month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we're hyped up for 420 from the
beginning of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, it is 420 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has been 420 all month and we don't
even get to really celebrate kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually this time of year I would be
gearing up to go to the dude grows Cup and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd see all of our friends at the DGC
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have a good time do some bending do a
bunch of smoking have a little cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: competition a little friendly award
ceremony there that event is not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen for a couple of months because
we've got to push that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would also be one other event which
I would attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually there's one random event I booked
for the 420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not happening this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my 420 events and activities have
basically been online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been on Skype or they've been on
Zoom or they've been on FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a couple of things on Instagram
live, but that has been most of my 420
[SPEAKER_00]: celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a really cool live show on YouTube
with Scotty real and Tennessee gardens and
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend stone trout bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a really good time,
but we are lacking in social interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some people around dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is starting to get kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I think about that,
I also think about how long is it going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be before we are all comfortable just
congregating and smoking together.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all congregating together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be around a large group of
people right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people we got to look out
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how long until a lot of us are
comfortable getting in a big room and just
[SPEAKER_00]: being together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 strangers in a small room with you and
then then we're going to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to light up a joint and put
your lips on a joint that that guy just
[SPEAKER_00]: put his lips on or that girl just put her
lips on or whichever D?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a little bit worried?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still a little bit skeptical and
brainwashed and paranoid over the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my main risk is getting other
people sick because I'm fairly healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still don't want to get a little bit
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be down for a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got shit to do every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take a day off for a fucking
stupid virus that tried to kick my ass or
[SPEAKER_00]: kill me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been laying low during this whole
quarantine situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of taking it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the weed growers and the video
gamers and also the fans only girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the girls, the thirsty girls,
the model girls, the Snapchat girls on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones living it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been waiting for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are professionals at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in training for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers have been isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders have been extra isolated for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a large portion of my social
interaction through online stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: through Instagram live, through that sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been laying low through most of
this quarantine stuff because I really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing for me to go do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere is shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to the dispensary occasionally
and I can get groceries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are mainly the things that I
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I drove through the drive through
car wash so that I could wash my car
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was just going stir crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove around the block about 14 times
and went through the car wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the car was all the way dry,
I came back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how exciting my day was today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than hanging out here and smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done ridiculous amounts of online
shopping, but now I'm getting shit
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered that I can't use anywhere
because I can't go anywhere to wear new
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go out in a new shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of silly right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are weird, but I'm really not sure
how long it's going to be until it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to remain paranoid for a
long time, even if the government or
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever you trust or believe, the Center
for Disease Control or the epidemic
[SPEAKER_00]: people, whoever you're watching on TV,
once they finally say it's okay for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: go out, a lot of people are still going to
be skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to want to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to want to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, B, most of the smoke
events we go to where you can consume,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in fairly small buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buildings are fairly tight without a
lot of ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a fairly large dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a dab and blow it out,
I can watch my dab go across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I record in my dining room.
[SPEAKER_00]: My little dining room area is probably an
eight by eight square, maybe six by six
[SPEAKER_00]: square where the table is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little tucked in like a cove
part of the kitchen, off the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dab fills this area, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a few seconds, it drifts into the
actual kitchen area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes into the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it moves over like toward the laundry
room area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it starts drifting down a
hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it only takes a minute for that dab
smoke to get all the way into my laundry
[SPEAKER_00]: room, which is the opposite end of the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the way into the kitchen or the
bedroom at the exact opposite end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my smoke, which is probably carrying
my germs and whatever else, has now
[SPEAKER_00]: traveled through the entire house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun shines in through this curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see where my smoke travels through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take a bong rip or a dab in the
living room, it fills that living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I exhale, it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking bounces off of that wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bounces off of that wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my smoke just kind of swirling
and chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a big presence in the room,
some sort of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: A smoky apparation just chilling out with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's a smoky vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blessing just being there with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it just floating around in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see my bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we're at events,
you can see everybody else's dabs and bong
[SPEAKER_00]: rips just circling around the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You watch people blow out real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got a fresh lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any air in their lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they just blew out a bunch of fresh
air and they go and dab in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suck that dab or that bong rip in
real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a big, fresh lung full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they blow it right back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of their virus and lung junk just
comes out right into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're all going to breathe it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they start coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start breathing even more heavily
because they're trying to recover from a
[SPEAKER_00]: big ass dab or a fat bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they're doing is sucking in more
smoke because those events are so cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's harder to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just gasping for oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several before you actually
get your shit together and you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: filled the room with all of your junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if there's 10 people in there,
imagine 10 people is worth of just junky,
[SPEAKER_00]: breathy, filled up in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we never really thought too much
about that until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw people trying to take precautions at
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always bring the alcohol swabs,
the little like a handy wipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an alcohol swab and just a little
like a condom package.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pop it open, wipe the rig down,
throw that in the trash, keep dabbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to wipe it off between every user.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we get lazy and we're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels kind of rude to be like,
hey, bro, wipe that off before I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the point of smoking with
your friends is to show that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: peaceful and we're united.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will smoke together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the smoke circle originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's part of the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring the pipe, I bring the goods,
or we both bring half of the pipe and we
[SPEAKER_00]: share the goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we know there's nothing weird in
the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things behind smoking
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ceremonies and rituals
that involve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting our mouth on that pipe together
was part of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started seeing people with a little
ceramic or what's it, a silicone insert
[SPEAKER_00]: that pops into your rig or into your bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put your mouth on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen people wearing those on
necklaces and lanyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen people trying to take
precautions, but not everybody was taking
[SPEAKER_00]: anything seriously when we would go to
these events, especially at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke lounges and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be people just lined up to hit
the same rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see everybody clean it before
and after each use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long is it going to be before we're
comfortable congregating with 10 people in
[SPEAKER_00]: a room, 20 people, 70 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the events we go to have 300 and
something people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are even larger than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How comfortable are you going to be with
that many people in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how soon will it be before you're
ready to just grab a joint that you just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw me hit it and then I'm passing it
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's at least got my drooling
germs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people before me hit it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far down is that joint burned?
[SPEAKER_00]: How comfortable are you going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is that going to take?
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is going to be different for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really curious to watch it go
because there are many people taking it
[SPEAKER_00]: super seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people kind of doing
the rules and trying to take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who are neutral,
who haven't changed their day at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are people that are like,
I don't give a fuck about this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do everything just like I
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really curious to see how this
evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really curious to see what it's doing
to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, cannabis is selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, alcohol, sex toys, things of
that nature are selling ridiculously fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recording equipment is hard to buy right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want specific, good recording
equipment, it's sold out at most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: music vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some industries are doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: While many are kind of at a standstill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, the cannabis industry is
thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, many facilities have
minimized their staff because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need human interaction in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can do the job with three people,
they've got three people working.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it would be much easier with four or
five, they still minimize it to three and
[SPEAKER_00]: let those people work their asses off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, it's just those three people
coming and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less people, less germs, less exchange of
bodily fluid and bodily air, less contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That minimizes the risk to get less people
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people can handle it because
they just work extra hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, that's probably the best
thing to do is just be at work or be at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to be out in the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, there's nothing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere is closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My town is a ghost town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the restaurants are offering
delivery only.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been so far into this quarantine
that many of my local restaurants have
[SPEAKER_00]: closed down until the quarantine is over
or they have just given up for good
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're not making enough money.
[SPEAKER_00]: To pay a staff to be there to wait for the
couple of food orders they do get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dispensaries are swamped with
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensaries are doing their best to
practice safe social distancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only allowing a certain amount of
people in the waiting room at a time,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size of the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if it's a six by six area,
you get one motherfucker in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a little bigger, we can fit more
people in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you're in the bud room,
they're actually minimizing your time in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They request four minutes per patient or
customer in the bud room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the medical and recreational
dispensaries, the protocols are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different at both places, but it's
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Colorado Cannabis Exchange,
they don't let you pass really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in the door to the bud room and
there is a counter and an ATM just working
[SPEAKER_00]: as a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as far as you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you going past there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in and you're stuck right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a few things inside of the glass
counter on display so that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the few concentrates we've got
left and then the flowers are behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud tinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a couple of menus printed
that are in the waiting room so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look in the waiting room and get a little
idea of what you want before you get back
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shopping experience is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to being able to grab the jars
and hold them and put the jar of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate or the jar of flowers up to my
nose and give it a smell and look and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if it looks appealing, smells appealing,
if it's the right color and texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I make my decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I had to look through the glass
and hope that it smelled good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shop with green dot labs so it is always
amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really satisfied with the crescendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go back for more and then again
for more because it was really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shopping experience is a little
bit different, but they are selling so
[SPEAKER_00]: much product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with the weird adjustments,
the medical and recreational dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: are selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been a line every time I have
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the line could be because it is
taking a touch longer to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the different setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also more people are shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that I see different people
at the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the same dispensaries on a
regular rotation, you start seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing brand new faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only places open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquor stores, the dispensaries,
very few restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bank is open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's drive through only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few places you can actually
go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dispensary and the car wash have
been very entertaining lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to feel like that weird guy that
just shows up at the dispensary with
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm just here to buy two grams
and to see another human, but I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: trying not to go too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go and I get my limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I'm scary low, I go back and
get my limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to go because there's
people there and I like people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is the cannabis industry,
the recreational and medical and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: free market cannabis industries are
thriving here in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are lucky enough that they have
declared cannabis, recreational and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis to be essential
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also did the same with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've talked about this on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to close the liquor
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made an announcement, hey,
liquor stores are to close at a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: time on this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody in Colorado went to the
nearest liquor store and got in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of funny to see that when
they're like, hey, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to buy booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was like, now, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were lines around the blocks and
none of those lines were going to be gone
[SPEAKER_00]: by the cutoff time where they said,
hey, this is when you close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last call for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so eventually our governor said,
hey, maybe we shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also did that because they thought
about the fact that people will go into
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong alcoholics will die if you cut them
off cold turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would just overload the hospitals
with unnecessary problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't give us some weed and
some alcohol while you lock us down for
[SPEAKER_00]: several weeks, we may fucking revolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see more problems than you were
prepared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they decided to leave the alcohol as
essential business and cannabis is deemed
[SPEAKER_00]: essential business, which I really find to
be a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gave a lot of job security to my
industry friends because many of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends are in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other friends are in the service
industries and they are all fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my comedian friends, all my waiter
and bartender and staff and whatever type
[SPEAKER_00]: of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bring something to somebody and
expect a tip, many of those people are
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of luck right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that at least my cannabis
industry friends are still in work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it sounds a little bit selfish,
but I'm really glad that I can still get
[SPEAKER_00]: my concentrate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we were all just cut off of all
of our concentrates, our flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: our buds, our dabs, our edibles,
whatever you do to medicate yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use sabs or rub in, if you go to
the dispensary and buy something,
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if they're just like, now we're
shutting that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of established a lifestyle
around having these products available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may, it may make a few people go a
little bit more than stir crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trapped with your family and
nothing to fucking lubricate your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I just realized I've been
rambling for like a complete 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: and we haven't covered a subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't talked about cannabis in any
sort of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a few notes written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to come hang out, do a fun 420
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some serious podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some 420 related stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like involving my audience in my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My listeners are great contributors to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the times when I call on
you for some answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, what are you listening to
while you're smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got control of the aux cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to put on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to play right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of music?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite band?
[SPEAKER_00]: What song?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something out there I should
really be listening to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you into?
[SPEAKER_00]: What gets you grooving for 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com or you can hit me on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter at G F Y H podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're listening to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's some 420 music out there,
I need to catch onto introduce me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some stoner music,
I need to hear some reggae music I might
[SPEAKER_00]: be into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got some obscure shit that
you think I might like, introduce me to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just let me know what you're going to
play while we smoke a bowl for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm asking, I'll share a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I would probably put on some
task and Linus just because I like
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to task and Linus when I'm
taking dabs at 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would probably put on some rootsy
feeling reggae, maybe some eco mouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we may go on to something a little
more modern, a little more well produced
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want that low tone in my ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may go with some revolution or
something like that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're going to have to go rootsy
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we may go some like Morgan heritage
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we'll finish the day with fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to listen to fish in the evenings,
just smoke down, listen to fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets my brain wander a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a long fishy jam when Trey is really
lighting it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that listens knows I'm a huge
fish fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a giant Grateful Dead fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of my strains are named after
Grateful Dead songs and Grateful Dead type
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where my musical taste is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, rootsy, dub, reggae,
fish and the Grateful Dead are always
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be my top three choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm a classic rock guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raised with three stoner uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I had two aunts and my mom
who were also semi potheads who liked just
[SPEAKER_00]: good old fashioned classic rock,
rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been paid to play with a lot of
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was known around here as the guy that
could fill in for your classic rock band.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know all of that classic rock stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blame that on my upbringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The songs were in my head when I started
playing drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, let's just learn all of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you want to kind of delve into the
a little bit random side of my music,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up with like a lot of Metallica
type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of Metallica, Megadeth,
Pantera, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, all that 1995
[SPEAKER_00]: MTV stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig on that shit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I dig on for music.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we really need a change and the trim
crew is lagging and we've been there too
[SPEAKER_00]: long and you could tell that people are
dragging ass and they want to go home
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on a Thursday, it's not quite Friday
and everybody wishes it was Friday because
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday's got its own vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Thursday, that's when I put on that
like cheesy 90s pop rock fucking just
[SPEAKER_00]: cheesy white guy rock music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some bare naked ladies in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not by choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put on like a Spotify channel and
play that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get, what are those guys
called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar Ray and fucking bare naked ladies
and all that cheesy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that other group that I'm thinking
of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody wants Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is so cheesy, but when you get
the crew singing it and you're all just
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing, it'll bring a totally different
vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It refreshes the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like my last resort when things
have gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It unites the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just start seeing different people
sing songs and you're like, I had no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: you would know that one and no idea you
would know that one, but that shit works
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only play it for a few songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get everybody going again,
you let them pick their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things is if I run the
grow, if I'm the cultivation manager,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first grower to get there gets to
select the music for the grow part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first trimmer to get there selects
music for the trim part of the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we jam their music for the first part
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a little reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where my musical brain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about music.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Munchies and snacks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some good music on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to reach for to put in
your face?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to have some sort of a
snack?
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly try to not snack too much after
I dab because then I just need more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself in this vicious cycle of
dabs, snacks, dabs, snacks, and you never
[SPEAKER_00]: really get to enjoy, I guess you enjoy the
shit out of the snacks, but you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: just chasing that high away by eating
snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to get fairly blazed and don't
eat for a long time until it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, you better eat or shit's going to go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I like to I have food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to eat good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been really not bragging here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds like shit for a minute,
but I've really eliminated sugar and crap
[SPEAKER_00]: from my diet and all the snacks have kind
of been switched over to like hummus and
[SPEAKER_00]: carrots and like actual good fruit and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I've quit eating all the sugary
stuff and spoiling my face with crap,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and real food tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I drink kombucha now,
the kombucha just tingles and dances on my
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm not drinking Dr. Pepper,
that kombucha tastes so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the kombucha is not for some
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's for you, you know what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just sweet kombucha dance,
a nice grapefruit sparkling kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it'll put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get stoned, what are you
reaching for to eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you reaching for to drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to go for like maybe
some strawberries, maybe some chopped up
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of fruit pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me not feel like a piece of shit
for spoiling myself with too much crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do catch myself eating a lot of peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches during
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is boredom eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go make a PB&J and fucking snack that
fucker down because it takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just chow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like my crappy snack lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the jelly is a little more sugar
and junk than really what I need,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with all the other fruit in my
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I mentioned, I really like a
nice kombucha, a nice cold frosty cold
[SPEAKER_00]: kombucha with a nice fizz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I also really dig an odd Walla,
the mango madness or a strawberry protein
[SPEAKER_00]: or almost any of the odd Wallas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hook me up with the fruity flavored one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be just happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the kind of shit I reach for
when it is snacky time, trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, trying to take care of myself and
do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you guys don't care about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a weed show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you take care of yourself,
you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water your plants and feed them
better, they act better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain and body will do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you one of the people that puts on a
movie and watches the same fucking movie
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've seen a movie, I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can watch a comedy special maybe twice
because there are going to be jokes I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't catch the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have time to watch the same
movie twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going to watch once you
get stoned?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got good music on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a snack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to watch a movie or are you
going to watch cartoons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a favorite TV show?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your shit that you put on TV?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a Netflix show you go to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we watching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here is the last part that I want to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a gamer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you playing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're producing music.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do to fidget with your fingers
once you get blazed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to turn on some video games?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you turn on the video games,
what are you playing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to know what my friends are
doing after they get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing to entertain your
mouth, your ears, your eyes, and your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands after you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate if you let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, my Twitter is at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now since we're talking about 420,
I think the most important question is
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about what I'm smoking on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking a bong load?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking a joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking a blunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have to scrape a resin out of an
old pipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what you're smoking through and
what you're putting in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking some Jack Herrera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking Golden Goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some Arise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're smoking and how
you're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, my email address is
growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Twitter is at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you bad motherfuckers out there,
Quarantinians and Coronians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for joining me
for a 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, all the talk about snacks put a
little rumble in my tummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to get some food going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make myself a little 420
personal buffet over here in the Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Palace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys have a wonderful and safe
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking stupid, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin 420 for the rest of us who are
trying to behave ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a great 420 next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make up for this when we are
allowed to go outside again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a giant St. Patrick's Easter
420 de Mayo party that is going to kick
[SPEAKER_00]: ass like you have never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it doesn't turn into a
Juneteenth and summer and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff all at one time party as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I hope this is over soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you can hang out with me on
Instagram.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to put more stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten some extra equipment that I
shared with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got more people that are able
to do shows online from their houses with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be doing audio and video shows
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please look forward to that and please
join me when those are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, I have been rambling for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to get out of here and
get some food in my belly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to get high as giraffe
pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll see me today on Instagram
live at 7 10 Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be taking dabs and celebrating 420
all by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to seeing me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
buddy stoned trout bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day, all night in the party,
everyone smoking sense of me, 420 rocking
[SPEAKER_01]: out with the mouse, John Brown lock out of
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took it right before the lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took it right before the breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone on the sense of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say that a sensei party,
everyone jump around like them hearty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes the naughty dready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say his name is Freddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been smoking sensei a long time
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes Jamaican daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got a cheap hot pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: She smoked sensei me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She smoked sensei me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day, all night in the party,
everyone smoking sensei me.
