[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 345 of the grow from
your heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, roll up a fat spliff,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some fresh water in the bong and start
heating up that dab nail because it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: for a fresh episode of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 345.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start these episodes
off by letting you know what I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of some
infinity OG nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination of underdog OG and
I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label describes it as gas and earth
and I completely agree it's gas and earth
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little bit of a punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always a fan of underdog OG that's
also known as Loompa's headband and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: always been a fan of the I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those strains have got a gassy,
fuely, funky kind of chemi kind of smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and aroma and flavor to them and that's
right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the infinity OG nectar is a beautiful
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it's got me rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good thing because this
episode is about one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my audience has shown that they
really enjoy when I do strain reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not aware already, I am
iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the breeder and founder and sole
proprietor of iReGenetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all of the breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all of the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the male selection, the female
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all of the seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all of the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I handle all of the emails and social
medias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about everything except distribution
is all on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the years working as iReGenetics
I have developed quite a few notable
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep mentioning that you guys like
it when I do strain reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to do a report on Lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about one of my proudest and
favorite crosses and let's just do a side
[SPEAKER_00]: rant because I'm famous for that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also somebody asked me what my favorite
strain was and I said I couldn't decide on
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were asking my favorite strain I've
bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I would give them my top three
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: My top three favorite strains that I have
bred in no particular order are the Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey, Arise, and the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you really quickly why
those are my top three favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Jeffrey is my favorite because
that lemon flavor, that limonene flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that smooth lemon candy, the high to it is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my eyes vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes great concentrates and it really
does what I want in a plant overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got that lemon candy and I named
it after myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time that everybody was naming
strains after themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arian had a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott had a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted a strain and instead of just
doing a Jeff's OG or something like that I
[SPEAKER_00]: went with the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Lemon Jeffrey is one of my top
three favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the same totem pole there or on
that same pyramid we have got the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is one of my favorites because I did
exactly what I was trying to do with that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought what if I take a really indica
dominant wide leaf shorter stockier plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and I cross it with this really skinny
leaf and the male that I used was gassy
[SPEAKER_00]: and cushy and feet smelling and the female
that I used was tropical and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like what if I cross those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should make something completely in the
middle that is totally unique and it did
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tested amazingly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not rare to see Arise testing in the
27 to 30% area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arise tests super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a beautiful blend of that indica
sativa mix which is kind of what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it worked out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first feminized project and it
went well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the aromas and flavors that came from
that were just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors that come from those plants
were just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being my first feminized project that
I worked with and the first thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were at a party and nobody had any
herb but me and somebody's like anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: got any weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like sure let's smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like we got to go in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went in the backyard and I sat down
on the steps to bust out my weed and put
[SPEAKER_00]: some in the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like holy shit as soon as I
cracked it open everybody at the party was
[SPEAKER_00]: like damn that smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was I felt the same way but I
didn't know it was that potent yet until I
[SPEAKER_00]: had taken it out in the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody in there in that area was a
smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had all smoked plenty of herb and they
all reacted heavily to the aroma and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and the potency of that Grateful
Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew I had something special there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole other story that I'm going
to share with you guys about Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog in the future but that's a
Grateful Dog episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top three would be Lemon Jeffery,
Arise and the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's continue and let's talk about
that lemony goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: My namesake Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffery is only available in
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffery is a cross of Lemon Skunk
and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Lemon Skunk is from Greenhouse Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Lemon Skunk plant is a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces super frosty buds that smell
like lemon candy and I always describe it
[SPEAKER_00]: as if you take a box of lemon heads and
pour the candy out and then just smell the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the box that sweet, soft,
smooth lemon candy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming from my Lemon Skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this Lemon Skunk for probably
seven or eight years and I've used her in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she smells amazing but this Lemon Skunk
plant grows kind of tall, kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy, kind of extra branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she doesn't put out enough yield for
how much space she takes and she also
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she produces a lot of resin and she
smells amazing and I love the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chose to breed with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose to breed it to my Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Golden Goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Golden Goat for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is Island Sweet Skunk,
Hawaiian Sativa and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a tropical smelling Sativa dominant
plant that doesn't get super tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays short and stout because of the
Romulan in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't give it enough light,
it will stretch and get tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Golden Goat will stay short and stocky
if you top it and give it plenty of light
[SPEAKER_00]: and room to spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't have room to spread,
it will go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have space for it to go out,
it will go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you teach it to go out,
if you train it, it will spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Golden Goat likes to finish around
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could let it go nine weeks if you
really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Skunk on the other hand,
that sucker could go 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could let it go longer if you wanted
and it would really pack on the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Romulan and the Golden Goat side
of things really keeps the flowering time
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Golden Goat has a tropical
delicious flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shorter, it's more stout and it
produces a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my heaviest harvests have come
from Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run just lights of Golden Goat
because I could just pull huge harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get almost three pounds per light
under the old school single ended bulbs
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day when everybody else was
striving for two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pulling 2.6 and three pounds of
light with crops of Golden Goat in seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal in this cross was to take that
Lemon Skunk smooth sweet flavor and mix it
[SPEAKER_00]: with that tropical flavor of the Golden
Goat while making more robust plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to put some vigor and some beef
into that Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Lemon Skunk is so dainty and skinny
and it just takes off and grows straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up into the lights, but it doesn't produce
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the aroma and the frost were so
phenomenal that I just had to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was trying to make my own feminized
Golden Goat seeds because I had posted
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of my Golden Goat crop and
everybody went nuts and wanted Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was making Golden Goat feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I make feminized seeds,
I always think why not put a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in here, do some thinking about it
and make some unique feminized crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: while I'm at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that this Lemon Skunk and Golden
Goat would pair well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just knew it's something, it's like
being a chef, it's like being an artist,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like being a musician, being a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that a lot of great
breeders are also chefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something with the palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just know that this and this are going
to make something phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hit the nail right on the head with
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about, I said earlier,
both of these are females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Skunk is a girl that came from a
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no male of the Golden Goat unless
you get a back cross or unless you reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which is what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mixed my own solution of silver
thiosulfate and I applied it at very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific rates and intervals and
dilutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I turned my female Golden Goat plant
into a male that produced pollen that only
[SPEAKER_00]: contained female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when I pollinated my female plant,
all of the seeds that came out are only
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cross is the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Lemon Skunk female crossed to the
Golden Goat reversed male is the Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be known as a Lemon Jeffrey
R1 because it is technically a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of packages that'll say
whatever, a Rise F1, a Rise F2 or Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat BX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Lemon Jeffrey R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough about the
background and parents of Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the plants
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see a lot of morphology or
different phenotypes from the Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically that perfect 50-50 mix of
Lemon Skunk and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grow like those short stout
Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cut the top off, the lower
branches meet up at the top nice and even
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a very beautiful, nice canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave that top glory bud and it
will produce a giant bud up there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you cut that main top out and let
all those bottoms catch up, you'll produce
[SPEAKER_00]: a big sea of beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll produce nice long spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it likes to be topped and it likes to
be trained and spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the phenotypes are going to
have that Christmas tree sort of shape to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be kind of branchy,
but they're not going to have a super
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That apical top isn't going to try to
stretch way above the rest of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: until late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to turn into a giant bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through most of veg and early flower,
it's not going to take off real tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in flower, that sucker is going to be
a giant baseball bat up on the top there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you top that one, you'll get a
whole bunch of arms just sticking up and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there will be a couple of weirdos in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some weird leaves because that
golden goat passes on some weird traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've noticed in golden goat crosses,
those super skinny leaves often have more
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got more potency to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thinner the leaf, the more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the longer they take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may see some weirdness from the
golden goat in some very rare phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also see phenotypes that produce
extra nodes and extra branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great for commercial production
because I feel like more nodes and more
[SPEAKER_00]: branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as most plants put off nodes
at the north, south, east, and west
[SPEAKER_00]: positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes golden goat crosses will throw
out a fifth and sixth set of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just a cross up the stem,
up the meristem, you've got more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: spiral happening like a spiral staircase
of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you the opportunity for more
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the basic phenotypical traits
of the lemon juniper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the height of lemon
jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffery will be fairly tall at the
end of flower, but you will have giant
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using any trellising or
sticks or netting of some sort,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got the opportunity and the potential
to double in size through the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe flower early if you're not going to
use a trellis or a scrog or tie these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants down in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're going to have that giant
glory bud in there, you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower early because they're going to
get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That middle bud is going to get huge if
you don't cut that main top out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants will get fairly tall with
moderate stretch in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will stretch on you if you don't take
that main top out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend spreading the branches out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just using individual pots,
put a bunch of sticks in there around the
[SPEAKER_00]: perimeter of the pot, put them outward and
then just spread those branches out so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the whole plant gets a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up the bottom quite a bit and let
those long arms develop long giant spear
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have some sort of trellis
or a tomato cage, use some sticks and
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out the plants real wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffery can cover some distance and
it likes a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more light you give it, the happier it
will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take care of lemon jeffery,
you should get fairly generous yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get huge harvests off of it in three
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get huge harvests in seven gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran it in private grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran it in home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran it in commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant puts out generous harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're a beginner grower,
you should be able to get great harvests
[SPEAKER_00]: off of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, being a sativa dominant hybrid,
I would recommend letting this plant go
[SPEAKER_00]: around 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be ready around 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend closer to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's up to your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will make a difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 63 to 70 days is what I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient because right at the end there,
they may pack on a little extra weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon jeffery may bulk up for you,
get a little chunkier right at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also she looks so pretty right at the
end of flower when you're flushing her out
[SPEAKER_00]: and she starts getting all chunky in those
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ends of the leaves just start turning
yellow and they start to curl down because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what she does at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves get long and they just curl
down toward the end and they get real
[SPEAKER_00]: pale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those buds are giant and bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks so pretty at the end if you
let it go 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 63, 70 days, that's what I would
recommend for flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about feeding
lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have fed the crap out of this plant and
she seems to be able to take a feeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: although all of my feeds are very well
balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do go high in PPMs, but I'm not
overdoing any one particular nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, lemon jeffery can
take a heavy feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would start off feeding her strong
because like I said, she goes 70 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: she'll need some nutrients for the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you get her fired up in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants uptake about 90% of their
nitrogen during the vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're feeding your plants
plenty of nitrogen in the vegetative phase
[SPEAKER_00]: before flower to give them plenty of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get that plant ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't OD your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think, well, Rasta Jeff said to feed
them a lot, so I need to go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking slam them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure they're getting fed
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least make sure you're giving them
enough NPNK and maybe some Kalamag and
[SPEAKER_00]: then definitely take care of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put something in there for the roots,
some sort of root inoculant, some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial, some sort of root booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something that works on the roots
for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I recommend as a bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure your plants are healthy
before they go into the flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the flower phase, especially with a
longer flowering plant like the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to have plenty of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be chasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see around week three, four,
maybe week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts fading already and you're
feeding it right, but you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I've got a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it just went nitrogen
deficient on you because it took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't giving it enough nitrogen late
in flower or late in veg and possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed your plants and lemon Jeffrey can
take a lot of feeding is my point to that
[SPEAKER_00]: rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure your pH is on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey, in my experience,
likes to be somewhere between 6.2 and 6.4
[SPEAKER_00]: in cocoa or soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you mix up your nutrients,
get everything all mixed up the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get your pH pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the pH is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your pH up or pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a few drops in there until you get it
somewhere between 6.2 and 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where those plants are going to
want that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where they're going to react the best
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go crazy when you get it
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to them and write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the pH and then pay attention
to how they grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next time, maybe if you went
6.2 this time, write it down and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants reacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time adjust your solution to 6.4
and water the plants and write down 6.4
[SPEAKER_00]: and see how the plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see a difference, stick with
what worked better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's trial and error when
you're learning with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, make sure you get the pH correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get the feed dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for sure, got to sound like Brendan
Chobb, for sure, make sure you flush this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of your lemon Jeffrey plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain is known for its delicious
lemon candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not ruin that by failing to flush
our plants at the end and making it taste
[SPEAKER_00]: like burnt ash or something funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much molasses did you put in here
at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much worm castings was in this mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anybody to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much cow mag did you feed these
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to taste like sweet lemon
candies, not like botanic hair at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sounds like a good way to segue
into the flavors and aromas of lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say it a lot, but I think it
smells and tastes like if you took a box
[SPEAKER_00]: of lemon heads and you poured those lemon
heads on the table and you just smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you squeeze it, that soft lemon head,
lemon sorbet kind of candy smell that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also sort of like country time
lemonade powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the country time lemonade
powder and you pop it open and just stick
[SPEAKER_00]: your head in there and give it a light
smell, don't inhale too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to snort up any of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you smell that country time
lemonade powder, that's kind of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also maybe a lemon car air freshener or
also some of that lemon lime Gatorade
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's got a hint of sweet tarts
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that aftertaste, that after aroma
of sweet tarts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually the flavors that I
experience with lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
effects of lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really prefer like a sativa heavy,
high THC lemon lime flavored kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain for my daytime smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may find lemon Jeffrey to be
too potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tests in the high 20s consistently,
24 to 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 28% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's too much for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel euphoric and talkative
and energized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, it makes them a little
anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that the people that are
already going kind of fast, the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are real talkative and that have a
lot of thoughts and have a lot to say and
[SPEAKER_00]: are always thinking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the strains with limonene,
things like lemon Jeffrey and lemon skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those strains sort of even
those people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It balances their conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slows them down and it puts them more
in a focus thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just being in a spin,
it kind of gives them a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can kind of quit talking at
everybody and kind of look at a person and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the lemon Jeffrey and the
lemon skunk kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just for that fast minded
talkative kind of a person with that
[SPEAKER_00]: creative, just nonstop kind of a mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that don't consume a lot of
cannabis and people that are already kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of quiet, people that can get jittery and
anxious, sometimes the lemon Jeffrey may
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of give you a little bit of the
sweats and a little bit of the nerves
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is a quite potent strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's a beautiful morning smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that lemon flavor in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wakes my brain up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts all the pieces of my puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like overnight my brain just fell
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The puzzle pieces went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the lemon Jeffrey just puts
the puzzle pieces right back together for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, lemon Jeffrey puts me right in
that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other people, it could be too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could make you super giggly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could make you super paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will definitely make you talkative and
energetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the medical
effects of lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am reading these effects off of Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effects that have been reported to
Leafly about lemon Jeffrey are it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: to relieve stress, which I believe because
limonene, the terpene found in lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey has definitely been linked to
stress relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually doing scientific
research on terpenoids and limonene has
[SPEAKER_00]: been proven to help with stress relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that definitely is believable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing on the list is depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're not as stressed,
you're not as depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're giggling and smiling,
you don't feel depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that lemon Jeffrey could help
ease the effects of your depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it says here headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for sure that golden goat crosses
will help with migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it work on multiple people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says here that lemon Jeffrey will
help with your headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, lemon Jeffrey has been known to help
prevent seizures in folks with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great medical quality of the
lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I am not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just things that have been
reported by consumers and patients to
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just sharing that information with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your experience may be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my little disclaimer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the effects reported
from lemon Jeffrey while I'm here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read a couple of their reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw they have a bunch of reviews on
lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one says lemon Jeffrey is an
awesome, energetic and chill mode strain
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking for serious smokers that can
smoke and harness the effects of high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been so helpful to start my day
and helps my pain and keeps me focused and
[SPEAKER_00]: increases my appetite, which I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's a cool review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one says best strain I have ever
tried made everything so uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really cool review to see on a
strain that you bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those are from Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Leafly.com
for having lemon Jeffrey up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping they will put a rise up there
before too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's a quick
breakdown on the effects and flavors of
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers most of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a little tips and tricks
with lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is great for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to make BHO or rosin or
full spectrum extracts, lemon Jeffrey is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great strain for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at a lab test on my phone and
I've got a concentrate test from a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: who I'm not sure if they want their name
mentioned on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out for the great work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lab test that is showing 86.6
total cannabinoids with 75.4% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene test is showing 3.46% terpenes
and that is from a lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lemon Jeffrey makes wonderful
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always tastes super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always gives me an amazing high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon Jeffrey concentrates make my
eyes jitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make my eyes jump up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like remember when you were a kid and you
used to ride the school bus and you'd lean
[SPEAKER_00]: your head on the window and your eyes
would jump up and down a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything would move around real weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what it feels like when you
first take your dab of lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything goes brrrr and you got to grab
the table and get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: One great thing about lemon Jeffrey is it
takes heat very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is known to get kind of
tall, so it's going to grow right toward
[SPEAKER_00]: those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take that light heat fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying put it up against the
light, but if it gets too close and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets kind of warm, it's not going to get
too crazy and get too mad on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like limonene is a heat reaction
and a heat response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stress response in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we stress it with light and
heat a little bit, it will create a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more limonene in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed if you put your plants
too close to the light, sometimes they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: taste limonene, even if they're not a
lemon strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you do it with the limonene
strain, it will even more limonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take the heat fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are kind of a sativa dominant,
so they're not super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have gigantic leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not running a lot of problems in
that higher heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have never seen powdery mildew on
a lemon Jeffrey plant before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a few tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a few pointers with the lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you take pictures and make sure
you flush it so that you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious lemon candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's all I've got
