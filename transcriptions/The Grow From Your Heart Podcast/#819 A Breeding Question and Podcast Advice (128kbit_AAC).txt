[SPEAKER_00]: Scooter, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you a coupon for a free pack
of seeds off of iry direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scooter's question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hello, I love your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you say has such knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a question about root
biology of a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently on my first grow in week
four of veg and I was struggling for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first grow in a struggle is not a
surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say I was trying to use house and
garden sample kit to feed my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it seems I was over or underfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were looking terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning to use a nutrient line can be a
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will repeat myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just keep going and work through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will figure out the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have now decided to go into an
organic nutrition system.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this point forward, as I am
impatient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question now is, is there anything you
would warrant against this as the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are bringing synthetic, which are not
really doing anything and then switching
[SPEAKER_00]: to an organic nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here is this listener has
been growing with bottled nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not enjoying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not having a positive experience
instead of quitting altogether,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is admirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to switch to an organic nutrient
system, which I'm proud of you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've learned something's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll find enjoyment and success
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, am I going to shock the
plants and shock the roots by switching
[SPEAKER_00]: from this synthetic nutrient regimen to an
organic nutrient system?
[SPEAKER_00]: The quick and short answer is no,
as long as you don't overdo something and
[SPEAKER_00]: completely overfeed something in this
organic system, the plants probably will
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will say, oh, you've been feeding us
that bottled stuff that we weren't happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't get the mix figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just settle in, take a nice meal,
and they may adjust very quickly and
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate your switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said, as long as you're not
burning these plants, they should adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're covering all of your
basic needs, the 16 basic elements for
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja plants to grow healthily,
they're getting solid NPK, they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: their boosters, all the things that you
could put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they're getting the basic feed
and the basic nutrition, I think your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will enjoy the organic switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the bottled nutrients, those bottled
nutrients are buffered and they are being
[SPEAKER_00]: basically force fed to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way for the plant to say I do
want or I don't want this nutrient that is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the nutrients are formulated,
they're being force fed to your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: basically at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: When using the organic feeds, there are
systems within the plant's biology that
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, I need a little bit of this,
or hey, I need a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are signals and markers and
identifiers that tell the plant what to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake and what not to uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can kind of adjust itself a little
more, a lot more actually when it's using
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic nutrients compared to those
buffered nutrients when it's just being
[SPEAKER_00]: forced to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may find great success with this
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wish you best of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should work very well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did say I will update you with
pictures should you respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited to use all of the info you
provide to good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, the info here is go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not happy with what you're
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we can change the vibe and change
the success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, I do appreciate the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, I do appreciate the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've switched up the way that I'm sending
prizes, so I don't need your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your email address right here on
this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to save this and I will be able
to send you a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds off of iREDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it a lot easier for both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go select what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get shipped straight to you just
like all of the other orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saves us a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have finally got a good system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if I owe you seeds still,
please do send me a gentle reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use the new system to get your
seeds to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set that over there so I remember to
save that email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who wants to
be called Green Everything Channel is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you want me to call you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, the question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo, Rasta Jeff, I have a couple
of questions for the next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read both questions, but my friend,
you're only going to get one prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up for the try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, first, what advice or direction
could you steer a beginning podcaster and
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTuber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, how do you gain subscribers in the
beginning is where I find it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a new YouTuber, as a new podcaster,
how do you gain subscribers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing cannabis content for quite
a while and I feel like I've plateaued and
[SPEAKER_00]: peaked out around 11,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am definitely shadow banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pop up on people's YouTube
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to be subscribed to me to find
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to search for my show to find
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any real good advice on
getting more subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is podcast from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it with passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it for sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it for clout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it because it's what you love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to grow ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I was a little kid, I remember just
having this idea that I wanted to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: and express my thoughts in some sort of a
way that people beyond my social circle
[SPEAKER_00]: would hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that's what I wanted as a
kid, but that was what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be a podcaster before
podcasting existed and I love growing
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love teaching a lesson about growing
ganja and then having people email me back
[SPEAKER_00]: going, bro, I was fucked in the garden and
I listened to your show and now my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about that feels really good to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only do a podcast if it feels that good to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like, if you have to do this,
hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeking inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeking motivation to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's not a podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go, Hey bro, turn on the
mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got shit to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how a podcast should happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same way I say grow from your
heart, breed with love, set yourself up
[SPEAKER_00]: for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that as well in the podcast realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know how far into the
podcasting game you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how experienced you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of show you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about you to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will later on check out the green
everything channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I understand that that's a
podcast or a show, but my biggest piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: advice, and this goes to anybody and
everybody out there trying to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to outdo yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off with a stumbly half ass
podcast and I had to edit a lot and fix a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes I'll pick my nose a little
bit on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll scratch my eye on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say what I say, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I check my notes a couple of times and I
do the show that I feel like is a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I let you see that I am not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a robot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person out here putting together a
show that is going to make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the best show that you can,
but don't be too much of a critic on
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself is what I think I'm trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to stumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to stutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to edit some shit
out, but also leave some of that in and
[SPEAKER_00]: show the world that you're a human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the audience, you guys,
whoever's watching and listening would
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer to see that once in a while I get a
booger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally I sneeze on a fucking
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to know that you're human.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the people connect with you,
us, them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down that barrier a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't CBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't HBO.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's passionate and accurate,
that's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, put out quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be too critical on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's one big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said hardest.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm not even going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the hardest part of podcasting is
getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done 817 shows, 800 and I said 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might not even be the right number.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm making mistakes and we're just
flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes for me, the hardest part is
just pressing record and pressing record
[SPEAKER_00]: and then shaking it off and going,
Hey, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as my arms are in the air and
I go welcome to the podcast, everybody by
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to get started just
because it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to get perfect until you
get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make some mistakes, get comfortable,
put out those terrible episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us watch your progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us be proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's embarrassing, but I love it when
people say, Hey bro, I found your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to episodes one through now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh man, they saw that old stuff
where I sucked at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there are some gems back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcasting was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some gold in the older episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go back and listen to
my older catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I said, um, and I said,
uh, and people interrupted me and we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: over each other fucking constantly in the
old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some quality in there and it shows
the growth and growth is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humans, we're all going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see the growth in your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see the growth in your growing
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the growth in yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and don't be embarrassed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've rambled on a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know I had that much info about
starting a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I didn't have good advice and here
I am giving you some fucking gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't be afraid to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just press record, start talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as long as it's not live at the time,
we can edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go back to the editing room and we
can cut out all that silly shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can make a good show out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, don't be too critical though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee, I just said, um, and paused for a
long ass time as I swallowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be natural, do a podcast and then,
uh, put out something you're passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if your show is about this
says everything green or green,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about plants, but if your show is
about bacon, if it's about roller skates,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's about kombucha, do it with passion
and you will have great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I answered the first part of
your question more than thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said the second part is a breeding
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of my favorite things to talk about
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casting and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you really think breeding with
a female that is pushed to show intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits by letting her go late in flower is
a bad idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that that increases the odds of
having her mafridite daughters,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what is, what is the increase if that
at all, the mother only her mafridited
[SPEAKER_00]: shows intersex traits because it was late
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would the offspring have a higher
rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand where you're going with
this and I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like saying, um, this person is
super cool, but sometimes around 11 PM
[SPEAKER_00]: they stabbed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've got a lot of better options.
[SPEAKER_00]: How good is this plant that you want to
breed with it, that it shows intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are better options.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing my brain says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why you could just have a better
plant would be my first instinct,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it sounds like you really want to
breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows intersex late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are those now, are those, is that
really showing like intersex flowers or is
[SPEAKER_00]: it just putting out one or two sterile
Nanner's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that would make a big difference to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where it makes a big difference
in our approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are probably breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I've got to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're most likely breeding for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some seeds so that you can grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it because you're the one that has
to deal with the outcome of this cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: not deal, but you reap what you sow
exactly with this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one putting your, uh,
intersex gene in the breeding mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one that knows it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one that knows to look out for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed for, uh, not just for myself,
but I breed to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a seed seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I sell a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put anything out there
with the opportunity for intersex plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for my customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you guys to have to not just
look for males, but also keep your head up
[SPEAKER_00]: for intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a different level of standard
because my seeds are going a different
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant is known to make intersex
traits and I really, really love it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with it, those seeds stay in my
vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else will ever have access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go off on a random tangent
here because it popped up in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes on social media or other
internet platforms, I see, I will even
[SPEAKER_00]: post a male plant and people will say,
that's a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, please educate
yourselves more on what is an intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a female plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a male plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason there are a couple of reasons I
ask that I'm a seed seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a male plant out of my pack and
you tell everybody that you got a herm,
[SPEAKER_00]: that definitely tarnishes my reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't let your miseducation tarnish
my reputation because you could not
[SPEAKER_00]: identify a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just immediately said, herm,
intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males are common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought a regular pack of seeds,
50% of those are going to be boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit calling those intersex plants,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for breeder's sake, not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every breeder out there wants you to stop
calling male plants herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels terrible when you're calling our
male plants herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have feelings and so do the
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm half exaggerating, but for real,
let's learn that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those things, so you got a branch,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you got your main stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a branch that comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things that grow right here,
those two looking ball looking things,
[SPEAKER_00]: those aren't male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are bracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes those will fill with the seed
if the plant is pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, that bract will just swell up and
it's not a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please read some plant anatomy books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, let me get myself back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about breeding with an
intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A possible intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely depends on when and how
strongly intersex that plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would breed with it for my own
personal use, I would never put an
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plant into the commercial
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about it like the intersex is
just a touch of poison and it's in this
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to make a pie and you're
going to put this ingredient in the pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to mix up that pie batter,
that cake batter, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spread that pie batter out
to a bigger pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of poison in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every few slices is going to get some
poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you how much of that poison you
want to put into your pie mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've obviously confirmed that there is an
intersex trait within this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed with it if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put that poison into your
mix, you're more than welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will pop up in some of the pie
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many pieces of the
pie, but it is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if all that intersex trait
ran to one slice of pie or if it all
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where it is, but it is in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you if you want to take that
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't run the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read again and make sure I'm
answering the question correctly because I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I really got off on a random
tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mom only intersect because it was laid
in flower because we know that trait's
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, why would the offspring have a
higher rate of hermaphroditism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That trait is in there just like the
flavor, the color, the growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that are expressed by the
room, by its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are phenotypical expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That intersex trait is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just might not show under certain
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to feed it just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to get it too cold,
might have to run it too long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm subscribing and following now,
bro.

would call it.
