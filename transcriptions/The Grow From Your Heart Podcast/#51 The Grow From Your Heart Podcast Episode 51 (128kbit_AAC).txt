[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up, cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, a professional
grower, a longtime cannabis consumer,
[SPEAKER_02]: a brand new smoker, a cannabis activist,
or even someone who's just curious about
[SPEAKER_02]: the current state of cannabis,
This My Friends is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm excited because across the table
from me is one of my favorite people on
[SPEAKER_02]: this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said she did not want to be on the
podcast and then I talked her into it and
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Angela is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could say hello now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're so adorable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't supposed to say anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said she wanted to come hang out and
not talk, but I put a mic in her face and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get her talking because she's
a talkative chick.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not feeling super well today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I rescued her from work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to give her some medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to smoke some CBD herb on the
show and we're going to kind of see if it
[SPEAKER_02]: makes her feel better while she's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she took one hit off that bowl and
she started to smile a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dude, thanks for coming, Angela.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here to my left is this obnoxious
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Clint Stewart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tall Clint is back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obnoxious already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's how we like it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the show, obnoxious when you're
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to lively up.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's, she's mellow over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's smoking CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the comments on the board is like,
you know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything but Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, people, people like you because not
everybody is a cannabis expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you're the new guy, you remind
me to quit doing wheelies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to just ride with both wheels on the
ground and teach you guys how to get your
[SPEAKER_02]: balance and go straight before we start
doing backflips and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every once in a while you can do like a
one-hander, but like, let us, let us try
[SPEAKER_03]: to catch up to where you're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're at a level, what 50 and I'm
at a level negative one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to call you negative
anything, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, I did see you take two hits off of
a joint last night and for a whole car
[SPEAKER_02]: ride home, you were higher than giraffe
pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get that far, I want to say a
big thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to a cute dog cat and the mystic
roots band.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about Ari Shafir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've introduced everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so last night, my buddy Clint,
well about a month ago, my buddy Clint
[SPEAKER_02]: sent me a text message and said,
Ari Shafir comedy works January 30th.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, fuck yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And uh, Clint and I have barely had time
to even talk to each other over the past
[SPEAKER_02]: month.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been four or five text messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy new year.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then is Ari still happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the most recent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, I'm so glad when he was like,
fuck yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right, be at my house
at four and we'll do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem is it's, it's not Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm, uh, I just work too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's both of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff's busy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, it's just, I'm, uh,
I'm a steel worker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm there all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, you work a week days,
a week of days and then a week of nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would just drive my body insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a 12 hour shifts Monday through
Friday, seven to seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, so you're doing AM to PM and
then the next week you do PM to AM and
[SPEAKER_03]: then back and back and back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, so you're just constantly
trying to catch up on sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize for not coming and hanging
out with your brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you're here now and we got to have
tons of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last night, Clint, uh, Clint actually
bought me a ticket to go see Ari Shafir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you don't know Ari Shafir,
he's on at midnight quite often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you got to watch at midnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into funny shit, he's got a show
called, uh, this is not happening on
[SPEAKER_03]: Comedy Central.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a podcast called the Skeptic
Tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he just put a special out on
Comedy Central.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, paid regular, paid regular about his
experience, uh, coming up at the comedy
[SPEAKER_02]: store in Los Angeles, where most of our
favorite comedians seem to have gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: their start.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least, at least went through there for
a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed his comedy last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, he tore it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have never seen or paid attention to
Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the way up, Clint told me that Steve
Simone was the opening act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Steve Simone was amazingly funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a mostly clean comic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't, I don't think he ever said
fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might've, but I mean, it was in
passing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was something where it was,
it was so fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just, he's a ball of energy and- He's
still in sixth or fifth grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He pulls on his shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a 35 year old sixth grader.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's adorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a grown man watching him wiggle around
all uncomfortable, but comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, like he's got all that
attention that he wanted, but now he's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh shit, I've got the attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he starts wiggling, but he tore it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was real fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a shout out to Chris Charpentier
for hosting that show too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The openers get that short little set
because then they just do that highlight
[SPEAKER_02]: set.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good way to just show yourself off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Charpentier is a Denver guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we're trying to get him to come
down to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to do stuff down here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still, I'm still an open mic'er,
but we put on shows every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, we're busy with work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody's trying, but, uh,
made some new friends last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was real fun, uh, at the Denver comedy
works, which is our favorite club.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely my favorite comedy club on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got to make a whole bunch of friends
and it was, it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People gravitate toward my boy,
Jeff here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're six five and have dreadlocks
and a big cheesy smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was high as shit the whole,
whole day.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're that high and having fun,
people can tell they're like that guy's
[SPEAKER_02]: having a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be his friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and they probably also wanted to be
sitting front row like we were,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a little humble, humble brag
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big shout out to my buddy Baker from
comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hooked us up with the preferred seating
passes and I actually got a text message
[SPEAKER_02]: from him today saying, whenever we want
that, just let him know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are our seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said we are unofficial regulars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like a B level regular at that club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever we want to sit there,
those are our seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're my boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, dude, Ari, we want to give a huge
shout out to Ari and Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys tore it the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I laughed my ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've needed laughter is therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my life is stressful being a pot
grower, uh, having so many friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: having an internet life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my shit is stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I balance my stress pretty well,
but comedy is my medicine, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is my medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy is my, my soulful release and
music, but going to see comedy and
[SPEAKER_02]: laughing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I got refreshed yesterday was
hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might've been part of the therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you and I get to have good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, that's the thing with us is
we don't even, there's what?
[SPEAKER_03]: No time for music or anything on the way
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we just hang out, turn the radio
down and talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably one of the better parts
about not seeing somebody for a month
[SPEAKER_03]: though is like everything's brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would recommend everybody go check
out Ari Shaffir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out Ari Shaffir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Support that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: His t-shirts are 3d and they are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wearing one right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sweetest t-shirt I've ever seen on a
tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, super quick shout out to our buddy,
Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deacon Gray is experiencing throat cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been through all of his
chemotherapies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: His spirits are up, but I still want to
send you a big hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of comedies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a glove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deacon is a Denver comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, support Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you don't know who he is,
but just send him a big fat, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: jaw hug or whatever you believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send him some vibes cause he needs your
energy to get better over this cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think since laughter is medicine,
we need to return the favor to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's come down to Pueblo, down to Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a free show here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came to our little not super popular
town that has a bad reputation and did a
[SPEAKER_02]: show for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a Denver guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did he come here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out Ari.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, thank you for the ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a champ, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you I-25.
[SPEAKER_02]: I-25 can suck it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But last night wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit a little rush hour, but it wasn't too
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know my way right to comedy works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it blindfolded me and my car just
goes there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like that was so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ari Shaffir was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that's our point here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if you guys get the chance,
go check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Paid Regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari wouldn't mind me saying this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the Torrents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go find the extended version on a Torrent
site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please get the extended version.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't check out the broadcast version.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The name change is official, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is now called the Grow From Your
Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start trying to remember that
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not I Grow Culture anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new art is posted, but Facebook and
Stitcher are slow to update.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher won't change probably until I put
up this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been the wrong artwork, the wrong
show description for a week, and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: emailed them and they're like,
we'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's free, so they don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook will change my name February 4th.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to verify that I am who I am
because I'm a business and shit and they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want me just changing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so they're like, you get 14 days
and that comes up February 4th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all official shit that I needed to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The website, iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have got shirts and hat pins and
stickers on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a bunch of black t-shirts in
sizes small through extra, extra large and
[SPEAKER_02]: white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there are only about 10
iregenetics hat pins on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are going quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grab those while you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're there, join the forum on the
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I'm not trying to be a mooch,
but there's a donate button on that
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the podcast page,
there's a donate button.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you donate, you can donate $1 up to
however many you feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks, bucks of yours for my
[SPEAKER_02]: time and my effort, I would appreciate
your donation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not begging, but somebody said they
would donate if I put that there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You donate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes directly to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of, it helps me pay for the
show because I do put in a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still a free podcast though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to charge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to make you pay for
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying if you feel like it was
worth something and it's like a tip,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you felt like you got good
service, put in the tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of all the information this guy's
giving you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be like, Hmm, I could probably give
him a buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I got 5,000 listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they all gave me a buck, I would
definitely buy new microphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up 5,000?
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd buy new microphones for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my daughter's trying to go on an
adventure in Hawaii, an educational
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until that happens, all of the money
that goes into that donate button will go
[SPEAKER_02]: to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just straight send that to her
GoFundMe for her adventure in Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_02]: her educational adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I know I did a bunch of giveaways on
episode 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still giving you time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't listened to episode 50,
go listen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to win a bunch of bad ass prizes
from the Garden of Whedon, prizes from
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydro indoor growing supplies,
high prizes from Irene genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a highly educated t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I plan on deciding the winners around
episode 52 or 53.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I make the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll decide when I see the right comment
of what I did with, I don't even want to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you how to win the prizes,
but when I see the right one, the winner,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go, that guy wins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be by episode 53.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't drag it out too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Angela's sitting across the table
looking all sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look all red-eyed over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What strain are you smoking tonight?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cana Tonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cana Tonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the numbers on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's 0.5% THC and like almost 15%
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to kind of rewind and shout
out to Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers
[SPEAKER_02]: in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we got this high CBD
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angela is one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot about her and I'm going to
try not to talk too much about her world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you feel like you need to slow me
down and tell me not to say that or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, feel free to cut me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to be completely
respectful about this conversation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's your health that I'm talking
about and it's your private shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So interrupt me whenever you feel
necessary and chime in when you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angela used to dab with me like a fucking
champion, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angela used to smoke fat joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: She would roll joints the size of my
middle finger and I've got a big middle
[SPEAKER_02]: finger and her and I would smoke them just
to the dome and then she'd roll another
[SPEAKER_02]: one and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd smoke half of that and then put it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd smoke it later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was a heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day she had a mean headache and
somebody did the hippie pressure point
[SPEAKER_02]: where they squeeze between your forefinger
and your thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little spot in there that all
your old hippie friends will tell you if
[SPEAKER_02]: you squeeze that and rub that a little
bit, your headache will go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of our silly hippie friends did
that and she completely blacked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eyes did a little fluttering and she hit
the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when she came to, she was really
disoriented and kind of groggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been labeled a seizure is what
everybody, any medical person has called
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she went home.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got home from work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the first thing you want to do
after that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go fucking smoke a joint after
you just had some traumatic shit like that
[SPEAKER_02]: happen to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she tried that and she told me that
she felt like she was tripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, I'm hallucinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she put a blanket over her head and
laid down on the couch in the fetal
[SPEAKER_02]: position and wouldn't talk to me for like
an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was hating life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the girl that I've seen take
half gram dabs and laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to make fun of Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would smoke and Adam would tap out and
want to go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she'd be like, come on pussy,
smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked like two grams of wax to myself a
day around about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to push the mic to you just a
little closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wanting you a little louder so we
can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said that she used to smoke two grams
of wax a day by herself and her and I
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging out together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd kill and ate the hash in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on a normal day, just her and I
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she went home and smoked one joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or one dab or whatever and was freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she thought maybe it's just today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she gave it some time and went
about her life, but she still had a
[SPEAKER_02]: headache and didn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she smoked more weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time she would smoke weed,
she would just get ridiculously high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like hanging out with a high fifth
grader.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, you got to tuck her in and
get her something to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's really what was happening to
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She went from a pro to Clint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just we had to babysitter when she would
get high and she'd get super anxious,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of anxiety from smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found a few strains that would work
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Platinum OG was working well and the
Girl Scout Cookies was getting her too
[SPEAKER_02]: high, but it was the kind of a more
comfortable high for it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she didn't feel really, it was,
it's been about a month and she really did
[SPEAKER_02]: not feel good a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been about a week, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This only happened a week ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: The part I'm getting into now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably a month or two ago when
the seizure incident happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Longer than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been like three months now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I only know because I like really want
to get high like I used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's affecting her.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, it's affecting her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when I'm not smoking, my anxiety is
just super shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not being able to, obviously you kind
of Jones for some smoke because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: ritualistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just wanting to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her and I used to pass a joint back and
forth and lay around and smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, it just feels good to get
stoned and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like being sick and not being able to
smoke the medicine that she relied on,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's driving her crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can fucking see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making her kind of grouchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we going, we call my friend Joey at
natural mystic cannabis caregivers about a
[SPEAKER_02]: week ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Hey bro, do you have any
high CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, I sure do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on up to the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could remember the bud tender's
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was super helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would hire her if I owned a shop any
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That girl knew about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had great skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I remembered your name because she
was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that she'll ever listen to
this, but she deserves a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go up there and we get the CBD
medicine and we got can a tonic,
[SPEAKER_02]: can a Sue, and Tora Bora, and they're all
super high CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got Tora Sue actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but we get, we get to the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to be discreet here,
but we got to the fucking car and she
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't going to wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: She rolled up the joint and she started
smoking it and she got about halfway
[SPEAKER_02]: through the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked over like, you're smoking
like a lot of weed over there for someone
[SPEAKER_02]: that has panic attacks or smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she looked at me and she goes,
I am high and smiled about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for myself, I've smoked a lot of CBD
cannabis and I've written it off because
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't seem to really do anything for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't do, I want to get high when I
smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to feel that cycle or that
psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slightly, I don't even know what to
call that head change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be fucking high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get high when I smoke weed and
CBD doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've written it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're like, this is a high CBD
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh, I'm not going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you have pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm just wasting that dab or that
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know it's helpful for patients,
but watching her, it changed our entire
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just she smoked that joint and half of
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I smoked half of one with her and
I had taken a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stopped to smoke on the drive and I,
we pulled over and got out and did a
[SPEAKER_02]: little hike and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took a couple dabs, but then after I
smoked that joint, it felt like my dab
[SPEAKER_02]: high was kind of diminished.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, no, you're not as high as you
used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, why am I getting melo,
but it made me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me higher for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got giggly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both got kind of, and I don't get
giggly from smoking weed, but smoking that
[SPEAKER_02]: joint of CBD after a couple of dabs
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs don't give me an eye high.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, I miss when I smoked weed back in
the day, my eyes would get all droopy and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, damn, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs don't do that to me, but the CBD weed
totally put that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'm missing something when I'm
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I need to smoke more flowers and I
think I also need to incorporate more CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting clogged up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like CBD is like a,
not to call marijuana like a hard drug or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything, but do you feel like CBD is a
drug unto itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like THC is a drug and then CBD is a drug?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get your tolerance going for THC,
maybe that's not the same tolerance you
[SPEAKER_03]: would have for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's affecting a CBD receptor instead
of a THC receptor, which is also a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid receptor, but it's going to
affect you differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that sounds like something that that
people should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no, it's not just marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, you needed to kind of know
what's in that, like, or what style it is.
Completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now we're going to focus on
finding her a lot of CBD medicine because
[SPEAKER_02]: she's been, how far through that bowl?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you about halfway now?
[SPEAKER_06]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have like a hit or two left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's been here for 30 minutes and is
she a different person from when you got
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were laying on the couch in the dark
and now you don't even have the sunglasses
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like you're doing all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's helping you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making your headache go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're you look better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't look like you're trying to hide
from the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you don't feel good,
you guys, you know, when you don't feel
[SPEAKER_02]: good, you just want to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put your hoodie on and you try to curl
up into a little ball like you can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually almost disappear if you try hard
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your kids always find you and it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: All my customers today thought I was high
because I was so, my headache was so bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: My eyes were squinty and they're like,
man, you must be stoned as fuck today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angela's the budtender over at the Spot
Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Spot Dispensary in
Pueblo, West Colorado, the spot for high
[SPEAKER_02]: society.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop in and say, what's up to this cute
little dreadlock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Spot girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's blushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a nice spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only, the spot's the only
marijuana store that I've been to because
[SPEAKER_03]: normally I have other contexts where I can
get marijuana from, but it was a very nice
[SPEAKER_03]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the people in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all super helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had no problem finding what I needed to
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a nice store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cute little shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's under construction in the grow area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as it's ready, there will be
some Rasta Jeff growing happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get in the whole world excited about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of that have you talked about so
far?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the show?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much because we haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not super.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not my business yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: All your headphones cut out some times on
this channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not my business yet to be talking
about really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked about what I can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say that there are, uh, over 200
lights and that it's hydro and that the
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms are fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been in a lot of grows,
a lot of big grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I walked in there, I went,
damn, you guys did this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a show room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open these two swinging doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's double doors or one
door.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge fucking door.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open it and you walk in and there's a
show room that's the grow rooms are glass
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you can see into two rooms and the
water room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be, they plan to do like
visual tours and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to go look.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that part of them, I know I can say
because that's hyping it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to advertise that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm saying that's happening,
but I don't know what else I can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the grower there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is just cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm hoping to do a lot of things with
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's backing up another bowl over
there about, of that CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it been, other than today,
has it been helping you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know today was an extra stressful shitty
day for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this week really hasn't been like as
bad as the last like three months have
[SPEAKER_06]: been for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm pretty sure if I smoked this
before work that I would have felt better
[SPEAKER_02]: than you wouldn't have to bail out halfway
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, uh, she works with the person
that did the hippie fucking hand technique
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's kind of sympathetic still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should play that card whenever you
can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be like, you're the one who did it to
me asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your damn hippie magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn Vulcan hand grip.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab while you want to
hit that bowl while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's not smoking this evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to drive here pretty soon and I'm
not, uh, I'm not capable of smoke this
[SPEAKER_06]: with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Saturday night and there's a UFC
fight and there will be police everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to chill out and hang
out with the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you guys are smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think that's the best part about
this, uh, podcast is it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: information, you know, and they,
Jeff's doing a good job of trying to make
[SPEAKER_03]: it a fun and educational.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're making it educational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, finding that borderline.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the tough part is because
you guys can ramble on about a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, but that's like you said earlier is
maybe I'm the guy that, because I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know a lot about this stuff, even the
questions between a CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should talk more about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't have a book or I'm not even
going to pull up a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to kind of spat out of my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, CBD is a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think it's pronounced cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's works more as an analgesic and
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's known to have antibacterial
properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really well known for, and this is a
good segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really well known for stopping people
who have tremors and seizure type
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders or conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't even call it a disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calling it a disorder makes it sound like
you're fucking condemned or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this people with seizure conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was telling a random story that I
will tell on this show in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling a story to a friend who was
a paramedic and she said that CBD stops an
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical firing in your brain that
causes seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is why.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it, that's going to be really
helpful for anybody with seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, CBD definitely makes me hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm not smoking that bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like my first or second hit off a
CBD, my stomach goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got some cancer and you're
not eating from the chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, smoke some, uh, can a tonic that
stuff makes me starve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we went to lunch and then smoked
right after lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, you got to go back
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I'm full, I'll get hungry from
smoking the can a tonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff just makes you want to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it made my, I can play guitar longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that I got a new guitar for
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've noticed if I play too long,
my wrists and my forearm fingers hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I just keep going now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may just be building up endurance,
but I don't feel any pain from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would cramp up after a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this CBD stuff is instead of like the
head high that I normally get where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: just flying through the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's more of a body high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: You would probably experience a body high
because you're really a low tolerance to
[SPEAKER_02]: any cannabinoids, but people that have
smoked a little bit, it just goes straight
[SPEAKER_02]: to pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it knows where the pain is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Oh, your arm hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to drive right up to your arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to park here a lot on my little
CBD paramedic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to work on your arm or your
head or your neck and shoulders because
[SPEAKER_02]: she's had a lot of weird symptoms lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut off my description of what
cannabidiol is, but it's a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the opposite of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, the one that goes down instead
of up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I think it tastes like cherries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely think that a lot of herb that
has a CBD in it and extracts made with
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, they often have a cherry,
like a cherry hall's cough drop or a
[SPEAKER_02]: Luden's kind of a taste to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've always thought of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high in random.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about how it affects me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me really mellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me kind of smiley, like put a grin
on my face, like a giggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here's a really a random story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready for this one over there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh gosh, I know where this is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a long day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to Springs and bought some
cannabis, which is an hour drive away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we came home and like two
beautiful people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we got naked and we're both loving
what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after about an hour of us giving it to
each other, I kind of looked at her like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love what you're doing, but I'm never
going to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done everything I love and this is
not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she kind of looked at me like me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to embarrass you,
but it usually doesn't take much for her
[SPEAKER_02]: to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she gets three to my one cause she's
a girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not complaining, but I mean,
I didn't even see one.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's obvious when it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, she's not either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she goes, I think that CBD and I
was thinking it right as she said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes, I think that CBD weed killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the whole time it was
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I was almost there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was fucking amazing the entire time,
but it just wouldn't, there was no grand
[SPEAKER_02]: finale.
[SPEAKER_02]: No grand finale there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, it's not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, it's not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, so I talked to my paramedic friend
and she said that that same electrical
[SPEAKER_02]: firing in your brain that causes a seizure
is the same one that causes you to orgasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by smoking CBD, you pretty much just
turn that sucker off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said that opiates will do it times
10.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, good luck getting a boner on
opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, huh, I've never really.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said it just straight turns off that
electrical firing mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your brain to where you'll never come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she said, you probably could,
but like, you know, it's going to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more effort than what I really like
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to try that hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a gallon of sweat later.
[SPEAKER_02]: My legs were sore and I was kind of
sweaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you're cute as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is great, but I'm going to take a
brain check, you know, like, can I do that
[SPEAKER_03]: before?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's whiskey dick for me though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm not finishing today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had CBD dick, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was working, but it just
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got that CBD dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a few times he won't even
smoke my CBD weed for that reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Hey, I'm not going to smoke
that wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, part of the reason I don't smoke
it is because we bought a limited supply
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't need to waste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do much for me other than make
me hungry and not make me nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the price comparison on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that dispensary is very
completely fair and it's, they have three
[SPEAKER_02]: different price points of that herb and it
averages at $200 an ounce, but it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical only shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have a medical card to get
in there, but $200 an ounce is a very good
[SPEAKER_02]: price because she works at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you sell an ounce today?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we barely ever, because it's like 560
out the door or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: After taxes and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to buy a little white bag that
locks to even carry your ounce out in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the first accessory.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't even like, you're going to,
because you have to have that to leave the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary because that's childproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the dispensary watches their
ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so they actually have to sell you
that bag or they, that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: given with the 560.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's with the 560, but they could,
some dispensaries charge you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what the 560?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have the childproof bottles and
then we are supposed to charge for the
[SPEAKER_06]: bags for edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of the time we just give them to
people because they're buying a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreational is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stock up at that shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people really like to stock up when
they come.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun watching them shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are mesmerized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys come to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're from another state, drive out to
Colorado, uh, go to the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're coming from the South,
go to the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're up North, dude, um, go to like,
I don't even know who to tell you to up
[SPEAKER_02]: North.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find a good spot and I'll recommend
them soon, but come to the spot in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_02]: West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got such cool shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got like 25 strains of herb on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've never been in a dispensary and
somebody shows you 25 jars full of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you're going to smell every
single one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The budtender is going to start tapping
their foot because they've seen them all,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just, just, just, just look at every
one of them and enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing that to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're the budtender and I'm
telling them to do that, but enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that shit out, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoil yourself the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go look, it is so freaking neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember the first time I went into
a weed store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, either that or save yourself some
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start growing your own hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make up for telling them to take all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The budtenders do accept tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tip jar on the counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you toss some shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 600 bucks for an ounce out the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, most people are from out of state
and they can only buy quarter anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: They drove all the way here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to, I mean, I, that's, I,
I'm a, I'm an open mic comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm sure if anybody's heard me
before, they, they know how unfunny I am
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the time, but I'm not trying to
say I'm a comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying I'm an open mic comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open miker, but that's like one of my big
things is just how cool Colorado is
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to everybody else around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it must suck being from Utah or
Wyoming or Kansas or New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear, I hate Texas at least 15 times a
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: My customers are probably 50% of the
customers seem like they're from all,
[SPEAKER_06]: all from Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they hate, they hate Texas cause they
have to drive from there just to get legal
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's changing though, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The world's changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys do what you can where you are to get
cannabis legalized in your area so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have to drive all the way to
Pueblo, Colorado to come by an eighth for
[SPEAKER_02]: like 70 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of like people making changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to give a shout out to our buddy
Mike for holding it down at the city
[SPEAKER_03]: council stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neopunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really kicking ass, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does 12 hour days, 13, 14 hour days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so that he's able to get to the city
council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he got to work at six the other
day and finally got home from city council
[SPEAKER_02]: at 10 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: So however many hours that is Mike's
putting them in for us so that we can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can smoke so that we can do
what we do here and not feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: criminals again in our, in our local area
and the seven one nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good, thanks for reminding me of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, weren't you saying something?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were driving up yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got talking and I asked how's Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, well, they got this kind of thing
going on and they were talking about like
[SPEAKER_03]: your backyard stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want Mike in here to talk about
that better or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how a city council is trying to make
it to where we can have less plants in our
[SPEAKER_03]: backyard or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've kind of talked about a little
bit of that on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: City council is trying to limit us to like
six plants per household.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to grow it in an
outbuilding, not attached to your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike and I, Mike mostly, but since I
know a lot about growing, I was able to
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute a lot, but Mike wrote pages and
pages and pages on why that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been going to every, he goes to
the planning and zoning, the city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: City council, city commissioners,
any meeting that he can sit in and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is why that shit's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He shows up and puts it, and he's working
at like a 45 hour a week job doing
[SPEAKER_02]: construction too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's putting it in and he's doing,
he's actually building grows for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver bud company.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cannabis in some way or another,
but just thanks Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on Twitter, follow Mike,
what's he Neopunk?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nemo punk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's numbers after it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 13, 27.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 53.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be in the show notes for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look at my Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm following him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to say mine now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter's too slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, can we talk about the weed brain I got
on the way up there?
[SPEAKER_03]: My goldfish memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goldfish memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I have such a low tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked before we, I smoked here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked one hit and this is the funniest
thing to me because I know it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen and I want to hold a conversation
with people, but I, I smoke one hit off of
[SPEAKER_03]: my little pipe and I am like 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what was I talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's every 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tell Jeff like, yeah, I just don't
remember what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, dude, it was four seconds
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I just don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get off on these tangents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a pause at one point when we
were driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember who was talking,
but there was a pause and we looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: each other and I just go, I don't
remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just an unspoken.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're trying to hold a conversation
or if you're trying to be the cool guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe marijuana, like for the first time
isn't the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't even planning on smoking at
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, ah, we'll get back to the
car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll smoke in the car and we'll head back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when Ari Shaffir passes the joint
to it's like, ah, you know, I probably
[SPEAKER_03]: should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were silent until we got to the gas
station to get gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking out the window, just
enjoying, just thinking like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was so pretty out too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think I said one thing,
Denver's so pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was a beautiful night in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't ask for a better evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than those damn horses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeff, my boy Jeff here has had
nightmares and he's a, he's afraid of
[SPEAKER_03]: horse drawn carriages.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: He let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every time a horse drawn carriage was
coming our way, I just punched that horse
[SPEAKER_03]: right in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell it, get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there was, there were border,
there were boundaries drawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that horse got that far,
then that was when the punch would come.
[SPEAKER_02]: But luckily you never had to drop that
horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to see you just fucking
sucker punch a goddamn giant horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to cone in that horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a tumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what would have been a good tagline
after you punch a horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on my watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something really random.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on my watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know any like horse names,
like secretariat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kentucky Derby of dropping horses over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The honest truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico for a
short period of my time of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a dream, a nightmare that on the
plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this actually happened on the Plaza
in Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are horse drawn carriages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carrying yuppie folk around all the time,
just on dates and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got like Christmas lights and
candles on them and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all snazzy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a dream one night that I was in my
car and I could see this horse drawn
[SPEAKER_02]: carriage up the road, crossing the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just could not stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was only going like normal speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going over 45 or 50 in my dream,
but my car and I were like, stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I plowed into the horse drawn carriage
with people in the carriage and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it scarred me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I woke up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean to kill the horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now when I see the horse drawn
carriage and I'm driving, I'll fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: turn left and go somewhere else,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they can just ramble on and I'll
backtrack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be back when you're not around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them last night in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That part of like the 16th street mall
loves horse drawn carriages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yoga pants and Ugg boots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Horses and yoga pants is crazy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what to think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stretch them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stretch them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: One size fits all apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hole for the tail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what was the place we ate at that
pizza place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shout out to the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was yummy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that was a great trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for, thanks for making that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was your fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you drove, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way I can get high and drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seasoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get high and drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I got high before we left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took like six dabs, but I didn't get
high and drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drive high, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drive high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know your limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we got talking about why Jeff
doesn't drive when he's like cashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because Jeff's kind of an
ambassador for, as I see it, like with
[SPEAKER_03]: this podcast and stuff like that,
you're trying to make weed as acceptable
[SPEAKER_03]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, yes, you look like a hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you both got dreads, but you don't
need to be making the classic mistakes
[SPEAKER_03]: that every stoner movie like showcases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, he's so stoned that he can't get
off the couch or oh, he's seeing six
[SPEAKER_03]: shades of gray or something like that
because he, he smoked himself colorblind
[SPEAKER_03]: or some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's the dude, where's my car
effect where everybody's an idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of brought it up was the there
was traffic was going crazy up ahead of us
[SPEAKER_02]: and I wasn't sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, uh, pay attention to which,
which way the turn signals go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Clint found that to be some sort of
genius fucking observation because that
[SPEAKER_02]: the mile ahead, I can see the turn signals
flicker in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know if I need to start going left
or right now, cause I'm just going to copy
[SPEAKER_02]: the turn signals and I'll be in the proper
land instead of fighting for it when I get
[SPEAKER_02]: up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting cut off by two Priuses was not
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't supposed to talk about that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was passed by a fucking Prius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it felt very emasculating soccer bomb
car though.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're asking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the best part anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, turn lights or turn signals are
going on up ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just stoned enough to go,
Oh, that was really smart, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what that I was like,
well, I got to pay extra attention and be
[SPEAKER_02]: more, a little more on top of it because
I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more than an irie genetics,
Colorado cannabis T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The car reeks of dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the herb is in the back of the
car, in the backpack, in a bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just reeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like a pothead and I don't want to
be pulled over on the side of the road in
[SPEAKER_02]: a wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going, look at this stupid
pothead, high as shit, did something dumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I will scar the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, and this is what kind of
brought this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I kind of represent,
I have chosen to represent the community,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of us that do it,
but I'm one of the people that have chosen
[SPEAKER_02]: to speak out and put myself in the
spotlight for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need to be not a malnourished too
skinny dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to not be the cliche on the couch
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to not be fucking the red eyed in
every picture that you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why I got sunglasses on all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of wanted to bring that up is so
that way, maybe some of our friends who
[SPEAKER_03]: are taking the red eye pictures,
maybe they'll be like, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the, maybe the cliche stoner isn't
really what we want to be showcasing to a
[SPEAKER_03]: middle America, white America who doesn't,
I mean, I'm a cracker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, and, and for the
longest time it was, it was, it was
[SPEAKER_03]: something where weed was dangerous because
we're indoctrinated with that through dare
[SPEAKER_03]: and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, back in the day and the,
they taught us that the Mexicans and the
[SPEAKER_02]: black jazz musicians would smoke weed and
rape white bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, you'd turn into a demon and rape
the white women.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we were taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people, my grandparents, like they,
they were smart enough to go wait,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had friends that were like,
your kids are smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever I even going to be your
friends again, cause like my grandparents
[SPEAKER_02]: raised cool ass kids that were all pot
heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got three uncles and two aunts and
my mom, and they were all pot heads until
[SPEAKER_02]: their adulthood life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them still smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them gave them it up just cause my
mom can't smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: She gets so stupid when she smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing with weed is there isn't
that, of me and my buddy, Paul,
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul Rosales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Paul.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, he's probably at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we, we were talking about it the other
day and there's no, like with heroin,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get sick if you try to quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with meth and all these terrible drugs
and, and, but marijuana for the longest
[SPEAKER_03]: time was in that same category.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everybody thought that that's,
oh, it's, it's all the same, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but nobody talks about like, oh,
I can go into a seven 11 at any time
[SPEAKER_03]: before 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: and go buy as much alcohol as I can fit in
my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and no, that's okay because the big
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And take it to the state park and drink it
on your boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're completely allowed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could, I, I've been sober from
alcohol for eight years and I had to quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to quit because I had a real problem
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately, I didn't get withdrawals when
I decided to quit, but I do know people
[SPEAKER_03]: that do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get shakes at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been so long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was literally 22 years old when I quit
drinking.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, when you started at like 14,
but that was the thing is you could get
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alcohol was, you could get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like cigarettes were back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never going to stop you from getting what
you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't remember the dare officer
being like, dude, alcohol is the one you
[SPEAKER_03]: got to be watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they put fucking, if you look at
alcohol commercials, they make you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you drink Dos Equis, you are the
most interesting man in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't always drink Dos Equis,
but when I do, or I don't always drink
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol, but when I do, I get two chicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a cool ass dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone throws a party.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all this balloons happen and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fucking, just cause I drank some Dos
Equis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but on the opposite hand,
like anytime that you're smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're the stoner that sits on the couch
and you're just so type cast is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's such bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to give you a shout out Jeff
for being a good representation of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully some people on the, on the other
end of this podcast will agree with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm absolutely positive they do because
after I posted episode 50, my email and
[SPEAKER_02]: social media feeds have exploded with
people saying, thank you for this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you guys, you overwhelmed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made me like, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a feeling in my heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what to call it,
but there's this big bright white light
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes around my chest area when I
think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friends in this room can see it in
me when I'm talking about it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm like wiggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do get excited to have that many
people email me and go, dude, we're
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking proud of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your show is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm overwhelmed and super excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations on 50, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what's this 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got Angela on 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said she never wanted to be on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tricked me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally tricked you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I blurted you with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking hippies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted you to be here when I told the
story about us not being able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to finish our sexual escapade because I
want to do your respectful about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would have to play the episode for
you and let you edit out anything you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't like anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kept us on track and kept it nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you came for that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you, do you like, how's the store
treating you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like working there?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I was thinking of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can't say she fucking hates it on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I really like working there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreational is definitely a lot different
than working medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: The novelty like definitely wears off kind
of quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it just becomes a job a little
bit, but it's still, when people come in
[SPEAKER_06]: for the first time and they're really
excited that like makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I'm...
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really complain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sell weed all day for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that chunk came from
previous meals or the drink I just took,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, I wish I wouldn't have found
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go hang out at the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll show up with food or
sometimes the boss will just have random
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and I'll pop in and I don't want
to leave when I get there because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, everyone's just hanging out,
selling weed and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a nice place too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sweeping and cleaning and shit,
but I mean, you can bullshit with me while
[SPEAKER_02]: you're sweeping and cleaning and there's,
it's fun there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the crew is all like family too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all get along and... A little too well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little too well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're silly as shit and we're always
goofing around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everyone's listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I look forward to getting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I totally took over your answer,
but I look forward to getting in there
[SPEAKER_02]: because it looks so much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a favorite product from there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something that you would
recommend as a... Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Apothecanna lotion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I make Jeff rub me with that all the time
because my shoulders are always killing me
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's stuff is the shit, the extra
strength kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was skeptical of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't believe it would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one time I rubbed her down with
it and it made my hands all fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it definitely makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Apothecanna, the Grammy
Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's something... See,
that's just stuff that it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's a lotion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a lotion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a topical.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't get you high, but it definitely
is really relaxing for your muscles and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I definitely deal with a lot of neck
and back pain and that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it on my knee and it helps my bum
knee a little bit, makes it not hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it gets cold, my knee hurts and I rub
some of that on there and it won't hurt no
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said no-mo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you pick that up on the recreational
side as well as the medicinal side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: See?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the questions that need
answering.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we brought Clint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how long we've gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to look and see how long we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just chatting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: 49 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some news articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be episode 52.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just save those.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no need to get into the bunch of
news.
[SPEAKER_03]: My news is that February 21st,
we're doing a benefit show at the downtown
[SPEAKER_03]: bar in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if there's a cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there is a cover, but I don't
remember what it is, but I'm on early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on it like three o'clock in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a comedy first and then they're
going to do bands after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you pay maybe five bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a benefit show, February 21st.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are we benefiting?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is for Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for Pops?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Pops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Benefit you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grow From Your Heart podcast will try
to figure out some way to contribute to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's iRegenetics and Team iRe will have
to do something because, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pops is... I used to grow specific CBD
medicine for Pops back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got to grab my phone real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's going to grab his phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's got a note in there or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So February 21st in Pueblo, Colorado at
the downtown bar, there are going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've seen something about this,
but I see so many things on Facebook that
[SPEAKER_02]: my brain doesn't absorb all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Downtown bar, there's going to be a lot of
good music.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a lot of good comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get down there, support Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pops has been a staple of the Pueblo
community for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're from Pueblo and you've ever been
to any drinking establishment and you've
[SPEAKER_02]: had to deal with that old guy outside with
the gravelly voice that checks your ID,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me see your ID, that's Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's helped somebody to not kick your
ass at one point in your life if you've
[SPEAKER_02]: been to the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pops has been the bouncer and the security
guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's always that one asshole in the
bar that wants to fight and Pops will
[SPEAKER_02]: protect you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need some help for that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, get to your notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm rambling about Pops for a long time
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is February 21st at the downtown
bar, music and comedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the show starts at like two.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to be on maybe like three o
'clock, but it's the comedians.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to talk about the comedians
because there's so many guys coming down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan Rainey, myself, Paul Rosales,
Matt Chapman.
[SPEAKER_03]: What up, Matty?
[SPEAKER_03]: John Brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, John Brown?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade Ridley, Charlie McMullen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't shout them all out if you go that
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're all there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said go fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was but that's that's like a really
good group.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a good, very good group of funny
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you even get a smoke break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at all the funny guys you get to play
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that you're actually funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's all those dudes are quality
comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of those guys has funny shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of those guys are hacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that's my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made a joke on Facebook about a local
comedian being a hack and every comedian
[SPEAKER_02]: in Pueblo thought I was talking about
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that you just listed are not
the hacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people tell jokes they wrote.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that's that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they all heard that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Southern Colorado comedy is is really
pushing forward with our own sense of
[SPEAKER_03]: humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might not like me, but you're going to
like one of the guys on that or you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to like one of the people on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my favorite thing about the
comedy culture is it is it is kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: a weed culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they go hand in hand almost is
because everybody knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went up to that show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew people that knew people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our waitress was like, do you know this
person?
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of know this person, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But and they know that person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was it's just a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was great that Chris
Charpentier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him, I was like, do we need to get
you down to Pueblo because he had been
[SPEAKER_03]: scheduled down once, but he couldn't make
it that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was one of my favorite shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was David Borey came down with Sam
Talents and it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Byron Graham.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to everybody that comes down
to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really trying to work hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every second and fourth Thursday,
we're at the Rainbow Bar on Santa Fe doing
[SPEAKER_03]: an open mic, trying to promote that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did one this last week and it was it's
so fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a great place for comedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope everybody can come out and check
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Support local comedy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're not in Pueblo, there's
comedy where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're an aspiring comedian,
start the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All it takes is you to go stand somewhere
and tell some jokes and invite some
[SPEAKER_02]: friends to come listen, get four or five
people, make a little comedy showcase at
[SPEAKER_02]: the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every slow night, Wednesday nights are
good for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bars days, Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're on on Thursdays because we
don't want to compete with the downtown
[SPEAKER_03]: bar every Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we do the second and third
or the second and fourth Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be at the Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just I'm hoping people can come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a free show, free, free show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super fun and free fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys are so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super free fun comedy night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just became some Asian commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super free fun comedy night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got racist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't last an hour without that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For comedians, it's not bad, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said how comedians are friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like once we hung out with Ari for
just a couple of seconds, it just seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: like just some other dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked out with Ari in the alley and it
didn't even seem like we're smoking with a
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just smoked weed and he's like,
all right, guys, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had some phone texting going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he had some booty call to go tend
to and he was out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was literally a couple of
minutes there where nobody was talking and
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody gets so amped around like
celebrities.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really do feel like Ari Shaffir is a
celebrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's put in so much work to get to where
he's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his special was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his special just came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you would have thought like
all these guys that listen to his podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been all up on his nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was just kind of like, yeah,
we're just you're just a guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how he acts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a sweet sweater on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't like hearing about, I listen to
your show, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just fucking I don't want to talk about
me anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he didn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I'm just a dude, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I did too, because I told him
that if you get a chance, if you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to listen to that skeptic tank,
was it 202 with Ali Sadiq?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 202, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was such a good episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to listen to the Ari
Shaffir skeptic tank, listen to the
[SPEAKER_02]: episode that is titled Paid Regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's episode 201.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 200.
[SPEAKER_03]: But 200 was a couple of his comedy
buddies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really funny too, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Danish and whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to tell you to go listen to
something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to Grow From Your Heart podcast as
well.
