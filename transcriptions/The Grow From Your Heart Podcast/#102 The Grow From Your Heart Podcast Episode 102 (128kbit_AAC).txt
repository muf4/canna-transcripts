[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 102 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting across the table for me today is
our good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have fallen asleep on the couch for
a couple hours, so when you got here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have been a little bit groggy,
but I think I've got my shit together by
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naps are good for your health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Naps are really good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a bunch of dabs, eat a bunch of food,
and then you wake up on the couch
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering where time went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeling all refreshed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're back in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming today, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the listeners like having you on
because we get a lot of listens when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, before we get too far,
I want to give a big thank you shout out
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They let me play their music on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't ask me for anything in return.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super kind of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys support Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, Catherine Ramirez is the
most beautiful woman in reggae,
[SPEAKER_02]: so make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the Coot or the Mystic
Roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got some cool shit lined up today
to talk about, but first I want to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: brag about my good ass weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday, I think I recorded since this
Thursday, I saw Israel Vibration,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Saturday, my phone is too close to the
recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making weird noises.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going to throw that across the damn
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buy a phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need you for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturday, I went up to ComedyWorks to go
see our good friend Doug Benson again for
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the 15th or 20th ish time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for keeping the shop on lock
and holding everything down while Rasta
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff was up seeing Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody got to hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't have anybody to go with me
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I had some plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The person I wanted to go with me was
unable to go Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went up there and I had two tickets
and I walked up to the line and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: another dude by himself walking up to the
line, looked kind of confused,
[SPEAKER_02]: holding like his printed ticket and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell he was a noob to ComedyWorks
that he'd never been there and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out the ComedyWorks
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I watched him fumble around and I
started conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lit up a blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked a blunt there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the part in the line at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he goes, man, he asked me a
question about ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what he said
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, oh, no worries, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could totally do that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we walked in, he went to get his
ticket and I go, man, you don't even need
[SPEAKER_02]: your ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to sit with me tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, you want to sit front row,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, no, you're shitting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, yeah, man, I got two front row
passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go sit in the front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anybody that knows me that listens
to the show, I'm going to brag a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have got two lifetime preferred seating
passes for ComedyWorks in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I've got to do is let them know that
I'm coming and I will be seated in seat
[SPEAKER_02]: 12, which is the front two seats right
there in front of the stage, right where
[SPEAKER_02]: the comedians are spitting and drooling
and sweating and staring you in the face
[SPEAKER_02]: and making fun of you and putting you in
part of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The B part of the show section is how I
like to think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get made fun of every time I sit there
if I sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take this brand new stranger,
tall wookie in the front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, huge dreadlocks and a huge cheesy
smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they love me down there in the
front.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll love to make fun of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took this new dude that I'd never
met.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until that day, he was having kind of a
bad day up until then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, bro, just come with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go sit front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sat front row and he had the time
of his fucking life, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He laughed his ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me a hug and shit at the end of
the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my buddy Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening, bro, it was good
meeting you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the show, we go meet Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was really cool because it
was a Doug Loves Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Harlan Williams was a fucking guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harlan is one of my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pete Davidson or Davison from Saturday
Night Live was another guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Doug's friend and a comedian I've seen
several times, Jeff Tate, was the third
[SPEAKER_02]: guest.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hung out and got stoned with Jeff Tate
doesn't smoke pot, but he hung out with
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Doug Benson definitely smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got stoned with a whole bunch of cool ass
people in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I drove back to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I ate the mellow mushroom and
then I was still hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also ate at the Chiba Hut because I'm
a pothead and I'm a fat fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that shit was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drove home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're in food country,
you got to stop and get something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you drive past both of those
restaurants, you're like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm eating here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no stopping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friend Tiffany over at the
mellow mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for a delicious meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took good care of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great waitressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Saturday, Sunday did it all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a beautiful date Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was able to go with me Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Went up there and saw Doug Benson do stand
up comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tore it the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made fun of me a little bit both
nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two days of Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanging out with Doug Benson the second
night, he treated me it was not even like
[SPEAKER_02]: some celebrity and his fan hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff Tate walked up to me and asked me a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a question for me because I was
part of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the show, they play games
and they play a game called The Last Man
[SPEAKER_02]: Stanton.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is somebody in the audience
names an actor and then the participants
[SPEAKER_02]: in the game have to name movies that that
actor has been in until they run out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just keep going back and forth until
one of us can't do it no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Doug knew that I listened to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's like Rasta Jeff will definitely
have a name for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go to him for a name in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he let me give him the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it came time to it, I said,
I have two names in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to give you two of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he picked one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, no, just give me one and we'll do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the name I gave them for the game was
Philip Seymour Hoffman, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's got a lot of fucking movies and they
should know a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a lot of fun with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the show, Jeff Tate walked up and
he's like, who is your other name,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because I always forget the
guy's fucking name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had it like in my head right at that
moment for when he asked what I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I knew my time was up and I go,
I forgot, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, oh, you know, and I go,
yeah, but I always forget his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, he played the president in
mocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I could say mocking Jay,
he goes, oh, fucking Donald Sutherland,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, and hit me on the shoulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that dude knows his fucking movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff Tate knows his movies real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made me feel like a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those guys treat me like I am a homie
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I walk through ComedyWorks,
I get high fives.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even walk me to my seat
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, you're you know where your
fucking seat is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go have a seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy your night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do ComedyWorks is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go there a lot in college.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I'm I love going to music shows,
but some music crowds are assholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crowds have evolved into assholes that
want to shove their way to the front and
[SPEAKER_02]: spill their beer on you and just be a
disrespectful dick and don't appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of ruin some concerts for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started enjoying sitting in the back and
getting high as shit a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concerts are getting different as I'm
getting older.
[SPEAKER_02]: But comedy shows, they don't allow any of
that pushing and shoving bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll kick you right out if you heckle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're sitting down the whole time and
you can order food and they bring it to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So comedy shows have been kind of my new
go to thing for a date or for some fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great to take a girl out and
see a pretty girl smile at a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my date.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you listen to the show,
but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a great time with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another local comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do support local comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Wild Cousins comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all the Pueblo comedy crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about everything but
cannabis on this podcast for the past 10
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time for some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, let's not talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's fuck and smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to take a dab with me,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla glue or Girl Scout cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's take a quick second here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you realize what I just asked you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people in places that are
probably just smacking their SMDH,
[SPEAKER_02]: smack my damn head right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's shake my damn head,
but I always, I thought of it as smack my
[SPEAKER_02]: damn head.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smack myself in the foot.
I like that better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought of it when I first
saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's somebody just went,
this motherfucker has got Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies and Gorilla glue just sitting
there ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most beautiful hash you've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote yes for legalization while we're on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do, make sure that you
include some sort of law or paragraph in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of caveats with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That allows you to have some sort of
consumption place where everybody can
[SPEAKER_02]: gather and smoke cannabis because that's
what we missed here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now we're struggling to get
those types of rules in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like some wonderfulness?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like, yes, dude, enlighten me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we do, let's make a decision
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like the Girl Scout cookies or
would you like the Gorilla glue?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to go with the Gorilla glue
only because right before we started
[SPEAKER_01]: recording, we did sample the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was quite wonderful, but I coughed
for quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping the Gorilla glue will be
slightly less chokey for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you a little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's kind of, Mike takes a little tiny
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't I?
[SPEAKER_01]: No shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: People take the dab you want, not the dab
that everybody else is taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, yeah, you don't have to dab like
I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a dab that's comfortable for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike just said that he had some news to
share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make Mike share his news
before he takes this dab because like we
[SPEAKER_02]: just talked about, he's going to cough for
30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this dab will be your reward for
a quick cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dab is your reward that is waiting
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to dab while you tell us
about your news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a text a few days ago from a
local friend of mine in the industry down
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always been kind of a step removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's not an owner of a dispenser or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he got me a text saying he had a
licensing hearing he needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted me to attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he received his special use permit to
open a cannabis museum slash consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: location here in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this somebody that I know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the person I think I know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about specifics off the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Greener Side Empire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally know who you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, shout out old school Greener Side
Empire.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up Hanky B?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're doing well, homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Hanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you say Greener Side Empire,
that is the king of the Greener Side
[SPEAKER_02]: Empire.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of his buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up, shorter dude with curly hair?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be your bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look for that coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a cannabis museum?
[SPEAKER_01]: During the licensing hearing, his
description of it would be a marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: themed Hard Rock Cafe would be the closest
business that he could relate it to that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you sit down at your booth with
the marijuana product you bring yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be stuff on the wall that's
like marijuana was originally outlawed and
[SPEAKER_01]: da da da da da da, like historical stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've hired local historians,
like professional historians that do this
[SPEAKER_01]: for a living and are currently researching
cannabis because there isn't a local
[SPEAKER_01]: historian who expert... Word lost in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who focuses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, who specializes in cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose I could have qualified,
but I didn't know that was a job I could
[SPEAKER_02]: have had.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to come to somebody... All of
the schooling will be great and useful,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then they need to come to somebody
involved in it to polish it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they've got a couple of people
like us on the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't, I'm going to be that
person on the team for them, if at all
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dab Rock Cafe, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's got a name, but I don't
honestly remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that should be coming here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earliest estimates, first of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing how these things go, sometimes I'm
going to say by end of spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: we should have a place to go and enjoy
some cannabis out in the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a business that's private members only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that be in the city of Pueblo or in
the county of Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just into the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just into the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want that damn tax money,
but you won't let us have anything in the
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pueblo County passed rules and regs
for public consumption shops a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only been one other applicant that
I know of to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they fucked it up so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was painful to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I remember hearing about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really pissed that they did it
because that set everybody back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Mike reported on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is our correspondent now suddenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reporter Mike live from the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you win a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You win a free dab for such a wonderful
report on the show here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a cannabis museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the county of Pueblo here before too
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike said something about public
consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to humble myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to eat a little bit of crow,
if you will, on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never said eat crow before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the phrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that I've said it, I understand
where it comes in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it and thought that's a weird
phrase, but it just came in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to the phrase, eat some crow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got its place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you grubbing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, recently I've had I've had beef with
a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personal issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Childish bullshit that stuck in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they recently threw a harvest festival
here in Pueblo, Colorado, and their event
[SPEAKER_02]: was completely fucking successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They crushed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a public consumption event three
blocks from my house on the main street of
[SPEAKER_02]: our town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our town is called Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit happened on Pueblo Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoked hash and weed and had a
miniature cannabis cut basically in their
[SPEAKER_02]: parking lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four minutes from my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not attend it because, like I said,
I was seeing Doug Benson and that was my
[SPEAKER_02]: priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working, but a number of people that
I know were there, they said it went off
[SPEAKER_01]: huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence and Jesse cleaned house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence won six awards and Jesse won first
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse's outdoor Grape OG beat I don't know
if I'm supposed to say that shit was
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor, but Jesse's possibly outdoor
Grape OG greenhouse beat a bunch of indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Jesse for his victory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Spence for six fucking
awards, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Home runs, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got I've had personal issues with
those people and it's my choice over
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly business issues that were legal
involving a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even though we've got a little bit of
beef, we don't get along.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see eye to eye on fucking
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all in the same community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give them a shout out right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Terry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to fucking Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Crushed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big old fucking plate of crow right here
at the fucking Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking feasting on it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying it out loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: No sarcasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm a smart ass and I'm fucking I'm
straight faced right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear the turnout was way bigger than
they were expecting and that they've had a
[SPEAKER_02]: previous events and I'm going to go to the
next event that they throw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've never gone to one of their
events for personal nor personal stupid
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a stubborn asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something in me, if I don't like you for
something you've done in the past,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably not going to like you in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see them trying to make progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to work with those people
before and we just butt heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've kind of separated myself,
but I'm going to get over it and I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to go to their next event because they
crushed it this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to man up there for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you look perplexed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a weird look on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's I wished I would have gone to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I heard how well it went,
I was bummed that I had to work all
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of wish that I would have
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fully the first time I felt about
one of their events and they finally did
[SPEAKER_01]: it right from what I hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard about any blowback from it
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wrong went on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it went smoothly without it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been several days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Wednesday now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about to be Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably already would have Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in the Saturday morning paper
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Sunday paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say I was going to try
not to miss any Doug Benson shows at
[SPEAKER_02]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to get as many as I can
because if you tweet Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_02]: he will read your tweets during the first
20 minutes of his show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just reads tweets and makes fun of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just tweeted at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Doug, front row again, feels like
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he read a bunch of tweets and he
goes, this guy back here says,
[SPEAKER_02]: where's whatever my Twitter name?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, his tweet says, I'm way too
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, speaking of way too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross, the Jeffs in the front row again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's people fucking cheered,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They clapped and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, Ross, the Jeffs been in the
front row in that seat for the last 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Benson shows he hasn't missed a show
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try not to miss any.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the listeners out there want this
experience, the way to do it is don't tell
[SPEAKER_01]: them amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't tell them every Doug Benson show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the the slot in Denver is taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're never your ass lives in
Cincinnati.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a way to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the club in Cincinnati.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if that's see, like I almost want to
Google that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's I'm going to take fucking 30 seconds
to Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might pause it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have Siri do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been a Doug fan for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to start scheduling some of these
off work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just asked Siri, where's the club?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live stand up since a fucking Natty,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm such a comedy geek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You listen to a lot of podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy is one of my favorite fucking
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, because we've been rambling on
for like 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get on to a topic here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a couple of things in the news
that we could talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read an article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to read you the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's forever long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way too many words long.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found this article on a website
called The Guardian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike also read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be able to discuss it without
reading it here on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be able to paraphrase a little
bit for you guys and tell you what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, they're talking about an
influx of people coming from across the
[SPEAKER_02]: country to Pueblo, Colorado, because
Pueblo, Colorado, for the size of the city
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are and for our economic
development and the amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: jobs available, we are the most affordable
place to land when you come from out of
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree with that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're routinely ranked as like the
cheapest city in Colorado for our size.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you went to anywhere smaller,
you're pretty much fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the next smaller towns, there's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to have a shitload of money
to live in nowhere land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is there's there's 100,000 people
here, which is just about perfect for
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to a city that's not too expensive,
trying to get a new start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ranked as one of the cheapest cities
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's yeah, we're going to bring that
up later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver can spit some people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver can chew you up and spit you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of there's a lot of a
lot of reasons people are moving to Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legal marijuana is definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's dive into the story because I'm
about to talk about a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should get you fired up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've read I want to get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a pull in the fucking on the
chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a part of this story in like a
backroom sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met with all the players about this
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't spill too many of those beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read read away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to read it, but we'll talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're saying that all of these people
moving to Pueblo, Colorado, are beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: to put a burden on our resources here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a resource called Posada,
which is a nonprofit organization that
[SPEAKER_02]: helps families get their themselves on
their feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something happens to somebody here in
Pueblo, they can go to Posada.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there's a guy in this news
article that hurt his foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something fell on him and broke his foot
and he can't work for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to Posada to get a little
bit of help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they're giving him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly some food, probably some cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to keep him on his feet while he's
unable to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're saying that those resources at
Posada are being strained and the people
[SPEAKER_02]: are coming from all over the nation to
come work here and they're not prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you look like you got something on
your mind already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're stewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they're getting at is that legal
marijuana is creating a huge homeless
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like causing good,
hardworking Americans who got hooked on
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana to become homeless.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's attracting homeless people in other
areas to Pueblo, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the article goes on to cite people
that work at Posada and a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies in town saying that they've had
huge increases in people seeking services
[SPEAKER_01]: from them, whether it's housing vouchers
or food stamps or from the food bank,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine vouchers or help with medical
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Posada especially has been pretty vocal
with the press down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's spiraled nationally when the
anti-pot groups picked it up and started
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other newspapers started picking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems caused by Amendment 64
is more homeless people coming to Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: because of our marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just that idea never really made sense
to me until I realized that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal to be homeless most places,
but it is illegal to have pot most places.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And homeless people have huge rates of
substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're homeless, consuming
substances is a way to deal with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the miserable conditions in that
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can move to a place where
they're not going to chase you around and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw you in jail for having some weed,
why not be there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that's combined with a number of
other things that are happening at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, like legal marijuana here,
everybody's talking about how many
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of people are working in the
industry and how much money it's making.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's talking about what it takes to
get an MED badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something I was going to touch
on in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're homeless and there's a new
booming industry, humans have been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it since humans started doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We move to where there's work,
especially when there's no work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just coming out of a depression,
like a national depression, where work's
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to come by everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in our age demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember all those articles about
people in their 30s that moved home after
[SPEAKER_01]: college?
[SPEAKER_01]: A fuckload of them working weed to weed
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all got degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying me, but a lot of them got
degrees on internet stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those jobs are all taken up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit kind of failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not failed, but I mean, it's just gotten
so much easier to make a web page that
[SPEAKER_02]: that guy that used to know how to do it
isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a theory that that's going to
happen to the weed grower too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do a whole report on that
here on the podcast in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, those people are now in the weed
industry making a good living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making a pretty solid living, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of reasons homeless
people or people on the brink of being
[SPEAKER_01]: homeless are moving to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I've said it countless times,
like if you want to come here,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's great, but come prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, look what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come prepared is one of the seriously
that's written on this fucking paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people didn't like when
you're kind of at the end of your road
[SPEAKER_01]: financially and opportunity wise,
wherever you live and you hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and everything that's going on
here, all the stores, all it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I can get a job trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sit in a room and cut leaves off
buds all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can surely do it in scrubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll move there and do it,
but no one knows what that takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you're going to cut and come
prepared, that's definitely the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come here with a little bit of money
because it's going to take a minute to get
[SPEAKER_02]: a job in the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get before you even come here,
research a Colorado marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: division support badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming here for work,
in the industry, definitely know what it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes to get a job in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not going to get a job trimming
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may get a job trimming for your cousin
or whatever, but that shit's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: last long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to, that's not going to
sustain you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may sound fruitful right now,
but trimming for your buddy or trimming
[SPEAKER_02]: for whoever's got this girl option for
you, it's not going to work unless it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they own a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, a lot of people that
have lived here or have recently moved
[SPEAKER_01]: here with kind of a plan and gotten a job
that are growing their legal six plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and they need help trimming and they'll
call you and you can trim for them for
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10 hours once every 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to, you need to work for like
five of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to try to pay rent that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not going to find four others
right when you move here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it that the trimmers I use go trim
for other people, but I mean it's
[SPEAKER_02]: expected, but I hate that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like them seeing under my skirt or
something, but I didn't go tell everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else what was under there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if you're not trimming,
if you don't need a med badge,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably not a job that's going to
last for very long right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cleaning up illegal grow
operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting rid of all of that shit
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when things are legal, the illegal
stands out like a sore thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we've talked about on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So research getting your marijuana
enforcement division support badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got any drug felonies in the
last 10 years, don't even think about
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to Colorado to get a job in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to give you a badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have the badge, you can't
walk in the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't let you behind the counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't sweep the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I swear to God, get on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes two seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google Colorado, MED badge, and it'll come
right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our security guards are badged with their
security service, like trained with their
[SPEAKER_02]: security.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wear their security guard badge and
their shirts for their security and their
[SPEAKER_02]: gun all day long, but they are also
wearing a marijuana enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have that shit to work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to go spend an extra,
it's like 150 bucks for that badge just to
[SPEAKER_02]: work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, if you can't afford $150
badge and if you can't qualify for that
[SPEAKER_02]: badge, don't come here, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm not talking shit to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying don't come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to be stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to be able to get in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be relying on resources
here and you're going to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of makes it look shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can come here and do something,
you're invited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're able, if you're willing,
if you're ready, if you can trim,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're able to get the badge,
we'll take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, I'm going to sound like an
asshole here.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on it, the big four
requirements are no drug felonies in 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years, no felonies period in five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fucked up that you could have
like killed someone and like with your car
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago and get your badge before
the guy who got busted with an out or what
[SPEAKER_01]: is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two grams of concentrate in most places.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucked up world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so no drug felonies in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: No felonies in five and your student loans
and your child support need to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what in order means is you,
you means you have to call them and set up
[SPEAKER_01]: a payment plan and make one payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're already paying on it,
you're legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're already paying, paying on it and
everything's in good, good order,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've been ducking child support
for student loans for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to stand up, call Sally Mae and
start making payments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all they want is a receipt and proof
that you're paying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had to go show them that my student
loans were in good order.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I had to do is get a thing from both
loan companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I filled out, I printed the application
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I printed it at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I filled it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me like 30 minutes to do it,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just like a thick job
application, but really thorough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they give it to the FBI who
checks it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't just lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while they're checking it,
they're smart as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take your paperwork and start running
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they call you back while it's being
ran and they fingerprint you and they take
[SPEAKER_02]: their sweet fucking time fingerprinting
you so that if there is anything wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: with your paperwork, if you're illegal,
if you've got warrants, they'll come and
[SPEAKER_02]: get your ass right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wondered why it took so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like the tech was brand new and
yet it took her 74 tries to get my index
[SPEAKER_01]: finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fingerprinting thing, that laser
reading fingerprinter is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like this is on purpose after
like six tries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually come and arrested people
who've had warrants while they were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I was going to say,
and this is going to sound like really
[SPEAKER_01]: rude as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and take cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to the licensed place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not take a check or a money order.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the end of the day,
you take cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 150.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to quote the prices
right now because they change all the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid 150 for mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a big echo?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got these headphones on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought I heard echo.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as we're not echoing in the
recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I know it sounds great to pack
up your whole life and come to Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: and enjoy the dispensary and smoke some
legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But have a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as complicated as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use Adam as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're a deep sea fisherman,
we've got your fucking job here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam thought he was going to come here and
grow some paw and be the king shit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking to shit about Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam is making it, but Adam is not buying
whatever CD came out last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam is not going with us to dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work construction with him all winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: See?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to, Adam, I love you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He showed up, realized that that wasn't
going to be how it was going to play out
[SPEAKER_01]: and immediately got to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought he was going to come here and
grow and survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fight for it, you can make it,
but come here with a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save up some money, find a job,
find a place or two that you want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: to rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like have a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or don't just show up here with a U-Haul
truck and $300 in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you will be homeless in like four
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or my option for you, which I recommend,
which you're going to think I'm a dick,
[SPEAKER_02]: but save the energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you were going to use to move here
and use that energy to fight for
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just push that over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do that right where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gather a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a bunch of like-minded folk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be cool if you can get all the
smokers around, but I understand a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of potheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you don't want the potheads to
go to city council with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of guys you just want to
leave behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've definitely had more than one walk up
and shoot themselves and everybody else in
[SPEAKER_01]: the foot and it sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those guys you can just leave them
behind, but try to get an intelligent
[SPEAKER_02]: group of people, put an ad on Craigslist
in your area, say, Hey, I want to fight to
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start a legalization group and you
guys get together and you make a petition
[SPEAKER_02]: and you make a petition and you try to get
it put on the ballot for your community
[SPEAKER_02]: that, Hey, we want to make a medical
marijuana legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even easier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already three groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this in the U S
there's already three groups in your
[SPEAKER_01]: state, town and city working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The national organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reform of marijuana laws,
the project policy, the marijuana policy
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I think I know who I'm reaching for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just fucking, I have that ADD and then
who's our third friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said there's three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said there are three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wasn't thinking of three
specifically, but there's a responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohio and there's a fucking one in Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just Google cannabis cannibal.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't Google cannibal.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least a dozen states are voting on
marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis advocacy groups for your area is
what you want to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then join that shit and then do what
you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, everybody's got their own gift in
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to fight for legalization,
you have to find where you fit in,
[SPEAKER_02]: find what you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: My niche is this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: My niche is making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: My niche is growing like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: My niche is taking care of my patients and
paying attention to what works for them
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinally and adjusting my growth
schedule and my grow nutrients and my
[SPEAKER_02]: gross strains to work for my individual
patients, medical needs, which is an art
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell you the fucking truth,
to grow enough weed for Mike and enough
[SPEAKER_02]: weed for Doug and the other people that I
supply and have the right strains at the
[SPEAKER_02]: right times for these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a little bit of scheduling and a
little bit of foresight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, whatever you do, if you're a
construction worker and you're looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: move here and do construction and smoke
weed in the evenings, have as much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking plan about what you're going to do
in life as Jeff just laid out right there
[SPEAKER_01]: is like what he does is his niche,
like at least that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be getting online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, Oh, you know, I'm a car
salesman, find a dozen car dealerships
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for employees before you even
consider moving out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call them, contact them, send them your
information, let them know you'll be here
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever looking for a job long before you
move out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that moved out here with just a
hope and a prayer, most of them have had
[SPEAKER_01]: to beg people for money so that they can
haul their ass back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Colorado has become the not
what you know, but who you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you want to be in the cannabis
industry right now, there's just so many
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and regulations and the tiniest fuck
up can cost the shop 10,000 to a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand bucks that you can lose their
license saying, um, because you did
[SPEAKER_01]: something that half the people that walk
in our doors every day assume we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so gaining that level of trust in a
job interview is a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if your main sales pitch is that
you've been high as shit for a decade,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just don't try, like come here and do
whatever you've been doing to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: living.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's selling weed, don't move here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we got stores that do that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I get to look at a lot of job
applications because, uh, anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes for the grow department, the job
applications get passed to myself and
[SPEAKER_02]: another guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would not believe some of the verbiage
that I see in job applications,
[SPEAKER_02]: like list your skills, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could grow the sticky icky fire dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got hydro skills with a Z and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we honestly, we throw those
applications away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, bring a resume, look professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the weed industry, but it is called
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to better our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make money so we can improve
our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can open more stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how business fucking works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't come trying to talk like you're a
cool gangster and try to impress us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legal comes with rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulations and expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be wearing a lab coat if
you work next to me in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were to lab coats, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a different lab coat for each
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to know that you're responsible
enough to wear this lab coat in room A and
[SPEAKER_02]: know that you need to take that son of a
bitch off and put on another lab coat
[SPEAKER_02]: before you enter room B.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be aware enough to actually
care about cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know that you can read the
warning signs when we use a pesticide and
[SPEAKER_02]: we put up a certain do not enter sign or
whatever gear is required to enter this
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know that you can read that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the salespeople, if I make a real
simple mistake, I can get the shop shut
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that works there pretty much with
the badge, if we say the wrong shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: the store can be closed in any minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys think we can hang out and smoke
pot and be chill?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's busy as fuck all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chairs where I work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no chairs in my work area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always standing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we're under camera from every angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: At all times, you're on two cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter where you are in that building,
there are two cameras covering that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot scratch my ass in that building
without being seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do something really funny,
you can go to the office and ask for the
[SPEAKER_02]: footage immediately because it's
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had security that was three rooms
away make fun of me for butt crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is on camera to the point where
they can read driver's licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They read the VIN number on my car outside
in a parking lot with the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how fucking smooth those cameras
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were reading VIN numbers on cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really don't understand the level
of regulation and scrutiny that the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is under.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those cameras go about 100 feet all the
way around the perimeter of the building,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way like 100 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go all the way to the street and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why when you hear about a dispenser
getting robbed in Colorado, you hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: the arrest of the guy who did it an hour
and a half later.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because if somebody smokes
anywhere near the building, our security
[SPEAKER_02]: guards damn near run outside with their
gun in their hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot smoke on our premises,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really wants to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm exaggerating, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot smoke anything anywhere near
our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've mentioned this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse my burping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a medical marijuana patient and I
cannot have any of my medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: products in my private vehicle on my work
shift in my car parked in the parking lot
[SPEAKER_02]: at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to wait until I get home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to drive home and dab hard after
work because I can't have the shit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that might be seen as on-site
consumption could cost the shop its
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't carry our beverages.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a guy that works in the back,
I can take my bottle, my Dr. Pepper after
[SPEAKER_02]: lunch, I can take that back to the back of
the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they will not let me take my drink
into the bud room when I go visit Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm chatting him up when I'm taking a
pee break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I hardly ever see each other at
work, but when we do, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No open containers in the bud room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you were a customer and you spilled
that shit in a jar of weed, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even charge you for what you just ruined
because I can legally only sell you a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter of an ounce or an ounce depending
on where your license says you're from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're from Texas and you spill
your water into a jar of weed that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: eight ounces of weed in it, this shop's
got to eat a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight ounces worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my jab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you take your water bottle back
there or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if it's got a lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, just a water bottle with a lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then keep it well the fuck away from
the blood counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I've seen a couple of
water bottles back by that window well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The window ledge is where they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they're safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the window ledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's strict, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm getting at is there is no hanging
out, smoking pot, being lazy, having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time I get to groove and have a
good time is when I'm pushing a broom or a
[SPEAKER_02]: mop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I will catch myself shaking my ass
because we play loud music in the back and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's good music up front most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's good music going on is one of
the best parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only time you get to chill out and
have fun is on lunch breaks or sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a little team meetings and shit,
which are fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hard work working in a dispenser,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming here to work in the
industry, be ready to put in work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: If like all day, every day, it never
stops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I go in and nine ish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just depends on the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more between eight and ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just depends on honestly how busy we're
going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I've got to do today and how
much time it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes we don't leave there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've left at seven o'clock before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone in at nine in the morning and
we've gone at eight and left at seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked several 12 hour days there
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys up front have to work longer
shifts because you can't close up there
[SPEAKER_02]: until the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the back we can pretty much work,
but we just got to finish the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of shit to do in the back
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what happens in the legal
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's work to be done and it's got
to get done by somebody and pot takes a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of planning for us in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: People come here with just the craziest
expectations and it's fucked a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're one of those guys that quits a
job all the time, if you're one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that can't show up on time,
if you're one of the guys that makes
[SPEAKER_02]: excuses, you're not going to make it in
the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to look professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to take care of yourself here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this may sound like shit,
but this is the truth for every one dude
[SPEAKER_02]: that is hireable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are seven women that are hireable
that are way more attractive than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a dude and you're trying to
get a job in the industry, you got to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your shit together because you put a real
resume together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful women sell more weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's already an uphill battle for a
lot of you dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the longest news article
summation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even read the news articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone so many different places with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to get slightly back on topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that pisses me off the most
about this whole legal podcast is an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in homelessness nonsense is like
one of the big reasons Pueblo is
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing a lot more homeless people
right now looking for services or people
[SPEAKER_01]: on the brink of being homeless,
looking for services is because all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cities around us currently bust homeless
people out of their area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way they've got to deal
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a persona could have anything they
wanted right now, it would be millions
[SPEAKER_01]: more funding so that they could send
everybody back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a small reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you send everybody home,
hopefully they've got family, friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the community that they know and
can make contact with to help them get
[SPEAKER_01]: back on their feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like somewhere where they're tied to the
community a little bit rather than here
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're strangers to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most places are just like,
Hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear this place up the way that you
probably can't get back to without a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of help is banging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a bus stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it there for free, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got like everything you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had a guy asked me for a ride that
one day and I probably would have told him
[SPEAKER_01]: no, except the place he was asking to go
was like a block and a half from where I
[SPEAKER_01]: was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a look at him and he looked
totally fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like recently, like his clothes were
clean, but he looked like he had the worst
[SPEAKER_01]: day after the worst month ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right, dude,
I can give you a ride to where I'm already
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got like 150, 20 pounds on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you pull like a real fucking
loaded weapon on me, I've got this,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I can reach you, it's I win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his little story just wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he had a serious medical condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he was in Albuquerque and they were
like, dude, didn't you hear Pueblo's got
[SPEAKER_01]: it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got like free services for you
with your shit and they'll take real good
[SPEAKER_01]: care of you and the community is going to
love you and they'll get you a house and a
[SPEAKER_01]: job and fucking get you on your feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Pueblo they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't got fuck off for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, unless you're looking to invest a
couple of million dollars in a new
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana farm, like Pueblo don't got what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's cheap to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the highest unemployment in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Colorado unemployment rates,
like four point something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the lower than, lowest in the
nation, but Pueblo's unemployment rate is
[SPEAKER_01]: like five and a half or six, like a good
point and a half higher than the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you magnify that times the amount
of people that are in the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's a huge, huge chunk of the jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of people that came
here looking for work that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking shit out of luck now because they
came with no plan, but we're trying to pin
[SPEAKER_01]: it all on legal pot when there's like 30
different reasons, homeless people and
[SPEAKER_01]: people about to be homeless or headed to
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't rank us the cheapest,
like the third cheapest city in the U S
[SPEAKER_01]: and expect that shit not to have
consequences, which is in every newspaper
[SPEAKER_01]: in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not plan poorly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: This dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm going to hit the dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hitting the fucking hit man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sampson hit man combo collab rig with
a highly educated D nail on it that runs
[SPEAKER_02]: to the, uh, G nail from emo tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to giddy up Dougie shot at the
task.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going while I dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me more about Posada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Posada is, I don't have anything
against Posada except they're being nuts
[SPEAKER_01]: on this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting national press talking
about how it's all marijuana's fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you read the article,
you'll get about three quarters of the way
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they mentioned like other cities,
bus and homeless people here and straight
[SPEAKER_01]: lying to them when they're putting them on
the bus town on Pueblo is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not a Pueblo being ranked the cheapest
city in the U S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, P tons of people moving here,
sure that three or four of them are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get jobs in the marijuana industry only
to find out that we don't take felons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, I mean, multiple, multiple,
they, they just don't publicize any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements anywhere outside of this
podcast, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your public service
announcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys make sure you Google that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you can find out if you're even
qualified to work in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going, if you're going,
if you're coming here to run an illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, I'm not even trying to be a
smart ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was deep shit into the illegal
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can admit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to get away from it because,
uh, it wasn't going to work much longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to go downhill trying to stay
on that side of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've got a steady job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the illegal industry is going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it crumbling here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people that are too stubborn to,
uh, come to the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see them struggling and dwindling
and falling off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a couple of years ago, the people I
knew that were living right on the edge
[SPEAKER_01]: between the black and the white market,
like the, what you'd call the gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the more stores that opened up,
the harder it was to compete with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the guy that had one strain for
you in March, come July would show up a
[SPEAKER_01]: seven by December.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash in his bag too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and by January, it was just too much
of a fucking hassle, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_01]: selection, because you could just go to a
store and pick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you never had to hang out and not
seem like foot traffic or any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meet somebody somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much, how many episodes of how it's
made would never have been watched if we
[SPEAKER_01]: could just buy weed in stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deadliest catch would have never been
viewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viewership on a lot of shit would go way
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't have to hang out with your
weed dealer for two hours, so you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: seem like you were there buying weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this dude's just really, really bored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of his friends come to visit for
two hours at a chunk, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just so much more convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you get to the shop and you're
like, really, that's the price fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you start wondering how much your
time's worth, like how many hours did I
[SPEAKER_01]: spend sitting on the couch listening to
bullshit because I was there to buy a bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the best weed in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause every weed dealer wants to show you
his new thing that he bought with your
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'm not into ukuleles, but all
right, I'll see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at my new didgeridoo, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything but more fucking deadliest catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to this song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I'm kicking that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I used to get stoned and
watch the fuck out of some deadliest
[SPEAKER_02]: catch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonder which one's going to get squashed
by a crab cage next.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write myself a note here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not show related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch more deadliest catch.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I record another podcast and I have a
deadliest catch story that I want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to tell on that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an episode where Jeff sent it
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to tell this weird ass dream
story on this podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this show is almost a fucking hour
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've teased all these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I got my wisdom teeth removed and
they gave me Vicodin and I took too many
[SPEAKER_02]: of them and I fell asleep watching
deadliest catch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the main setup here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I woke up in a dream that I had caught
somebody trying to kill people on the
[SPEAKER_02]: deadliest catch boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I murdered him cause he was trying to
kill me and in self defense, I killed him
[SPEAKER_02]: on the fucker because he killed everybody
else on the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I realized everybody on the boat
is dead, but me and they're going to think
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this shit and I'm all covered in
blood and the boat's all covered in blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I took too many Vicodin before I
fell asleep, when I woke up, I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was still dreaming, but I was physically
sitting up in real life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in dream life, I was still in my boat
and I saw blood all over my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took me a good, I don't really
know, but I'm going to say like three or
[SPEAKER_02]: four minutes of like shaking my head
around and walking around my bedroom
[SPEAKER_02]: going, why is there blood everywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally the blood faded away and
I woke up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do too many Vicodin, kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my fucking theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had my wisdom teeth taken out and
they fucking hurt, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of listening, but while I was
listening, I had a thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear your thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been rambly as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're still listening, I'll go
ahead and pay to send you a sticker pack
[SPEAKER_01]: or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you tweet me, I like it when you
ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tag fucking grow from your heart
podcasting it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a whole bunch of people still
listening and I get a shit load of tweets
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, we'll pick like three and I'll
pay to send you T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got plenty of stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they'll be, but we've
got stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got so many sponsors and vendors and
friends that I've got stickers for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll send you something really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some grassroots stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetic stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heart dab stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got plenty of stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

GFYH podcast with hashtag I like it when
[SPEAKER_02]: you ramble.

[SPEAKER_01]: It did go everywhere, but I like it
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes dabs take you fun places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since Mike's giving away shit,
I'm going to wrap up the show before he
[SPEAKER_02]: starts giving away more shit.
