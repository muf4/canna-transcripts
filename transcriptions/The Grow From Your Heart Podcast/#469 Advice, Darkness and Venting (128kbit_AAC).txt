[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go, a little Monday show
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for episode 469 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Headbanger Full
Spectrum Extract from our friends at Green
[SPEAKER_01]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a blend of Sour Diesel,
IBL, and Biker Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the package, the flavor is described as
sour and fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is completely sour, it is completely
fuely, and it is completely extra funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like a lemonade gas pump,
and that is a perfect aroma when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got that delicious aroma,
it's got a delicious flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the appearance of this concentrate is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a big 4 gram jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a nice jar of iced tea or
turp tea, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some nice icebergs floating
around in here, some nice diamonds,
[SPEAKER_01]: a perfect ratio of diamonds to turp sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy the appearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the aroma and flavor are
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't tell, the high from this
concentrate is fucking excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went straight to my head, it lifted me
up, it made me energetic, it made me want
[SPEAKER_01]: to come to a podcast, it made me just want
to talk my face off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip the jar over here and check out
the potency label.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the back of the jar, it says that this
product contains 66.31% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not contain any CBD, and I do
imagine that if we had a turp test on this
[SPEAKER_01]: product, the turping numbers would be
ridiculous because as soon as you open
[SPEAKER_01]: this jar, you can smell it from across the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious and ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: Headbanger Full Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get there, I would like to do

[SPEAKER_01]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world, before we get to
the email portion of the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about some fun that I got
to have recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listened to the last episode,
I'm sure you heard me mention that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally hitting my vape pen in a
comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk about those comedy
shows for a few minutes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the weekend, my buddy Clint came over
and we headed up to Denver together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some food and then we went to a
couple of wonderful comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started the evening off.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said before, we got some good food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had dinner at the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the Mellow Mushroom and
shout out to Clint for buying me dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a great dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we headed over to the Comedy Works to
see Brendan Schaub.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know about Comedy Works,
Comedy Works is one of the top three,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe top two best comedy clubs in the
country, if not on the entire planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a giant comedy nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love comedians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love going to comedy shows and laughing
my ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite frequently, so I am treated like
royalty at Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we headed to Comedy Works to see one of
my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to a podcast called The Fighter
and the Kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also listened to another podcast called
The King and the Sting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a guy who was on both of those
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Brendan Schaub.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a pretty funny comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a retired UFC fighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a fashion model.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an all around funny dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as I heard that Brendan Schaub
was coming to his hometown of Denver,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, to perform at one of the best
comedy clubs on the planet, I knew I had
[SPEAKER_01]: to grab a couple of tickets to go show
some Fighter and the Kid love,
[SPEAKER_01]: to go show some King and the Sting love,
to go see one of my favorite comedians,
[SPEAKER_01]: Brendan Schaub, in his hometown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am glad I decided to go because it
was a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we got in, they treated us like
royalty from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got VIP wristbands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got parking passes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got beautiful seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, I am right in the front at Comedy
Works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got there a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't put me right in the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a little VIP meet and greet thing
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people paid extra for fancy
tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put me about three rows back and I
really enjoyed that third row spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: My neck wasn't as cranked as it usually is
trying to look at the front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of nice to be right in the
third row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really great seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought us a couple of snacks,
got us some non-alcoholic drinks because
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint and I do not consume alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got settled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show began.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the host and emcee of the evening was
a great comedian whose name was Assange
[SPEAKER_01]: Ahmad.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are comedy fans, pay attention
to Assange Ahmad.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will hear of him in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hosted the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically walks out and he says,
hey, this is my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tells you a couple of rules about the
comedy club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, shut the fuck up and listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't heckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire exits are that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy a shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tip the waitress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the rest of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he brings out another comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got really excited because he said,
you know him as the voice of the King and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew it wasn't Theo because he's the
other member of the King and the Sting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew he was in another city doing a
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to bring to the stage Mr. Derek
[SPEAKER_01]: Poston.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Derek Poston is the producer of a
podcast called The King and the Sting,
[SPEAKER_01]: which also features Brennan Schaub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really excited to put a face on
Derek Poston because I hear him weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good to finally see the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, his comedy blew the fucking
room apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not prepared to be blown away by
Derek Poston the way I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did maybe 15 or 20 minutes,
but it felt like 30 minutes of laughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard for a comedian to take the
entire room with a very short amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a few minutes to suck people in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He walked out on stage and he's like,
what's up, motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fucking laughed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost pissed my pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, now are you ready for
Brennan Schaub?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Schaub came out and he did a lot of
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know that Schaub had that much
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just put out a special on Showtime
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time, once a comedian puts
out a special, they don't do that material
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you've heard those jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to fucking tell those jokes
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called burning the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it out and you move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You write a whole new hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go do that material in clubs for
a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe do that material in theaters for a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go back and record another
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, that material is burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get to do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there are some bits that people will
do over and over again, like the machine
[SPEAKER_01]: story with Bert Kreischer and then
anything Andrew Dice Clay, but those are
[SPEAKER_01]: comedic anomalies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those don't fucking count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, people don't want to
hear your shit twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you know the punchline, the joke
isn't funny anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was blown away and impressed with the
amount of material that Schaub brought to
[SPEAKER_01]: the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I really enjoy is when I hear
somebody from a podcast on a stage telling
[SPEAKER_01]: a story or doing a bit about stuff that
developed on the podcast recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like watching that comedic mind
and watching that comedic snowball happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like two guys are on a podcast talking and
something funny about, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a white guy with dreadlocks and a vape pen
comes up just in the funny conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hear him tell a joke about it
for two minutes and then you hear it kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of taper off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hear it on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of make another stupid joke
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called a callback when you bring
that up and you talk about it again and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it fades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go see him in a podcast or on
a comedy show two weeks later and he's got
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 minutes about it and you almost piss
your pants because you saw it develop and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that that's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That joke came from just a normal
conversation between two dudes and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: now a polished and honed bit that made,
I think ComedyWorks holds about 250,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 320 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made 300 people piss their pants
with laughter from a little joke that
[SPEAKER_01]: developed on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that is great to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I like seeing the influences in
comedians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said earlier, I'm a huge comedy nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is just gonna be a quick
rant about comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll move on to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've gone way too long about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like seeing the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like looking at a comedian and saying,
oh, you sound like this guy and this guy
[SPEAKER_01]: and this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really fun watching the influences
in shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of moments when I said
that was completely Brian Callan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was completely Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was completely Chris D'Elia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's okay because you're just
absorbing your influences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was fun to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to see Shob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shob crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to all three of the
comedians at that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Brennan Shob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Derek Poston and big
shout out to Assange Ahmad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet everybody after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, there was a little meet and
greet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to have a very brief conversation
with Brennan Shob.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, hey, I love the dreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked him straight in the face and
said, no, you don't, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave me a bewildered look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I listen to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how you feel about stupid white
guys with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made a face like, oh, shit,
I've offended people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a guy taking pictures
and he just goes, picture?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we both look at the camera and we do
our pose.
[SPEAKER_01]: The photo happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look back at him and I go,
bro, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you make fun of white people
with dreadlocks on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever stop doing comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he laughed and he goes, okay,
man, he like felt better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I set him up to like, I was like,
man, I know what you said about white
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then white people with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I let him feel relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, man, I think it's funny that you say
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't be offended because I'm a white
guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect jokes about white people with
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes being this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I said that, he felt relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see it in his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just shook his hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was walking away and I got a few
feet away and he goes, hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned around and he goes, how long you
been growing them things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, you sure have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really fun and entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I walked outside and got to spend a
minute with the two other comedians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Derek Poston is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very friendly, very approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also Assange Ahmad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very friendly, very approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a short conversation with both of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got to meet a young man who goes by
the name of Shark Eyes Doll Smile,
[SPEAKER_01]: also known as J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schaub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a popular guy if you listen to any
of the T Fat K or King and the Sting type
[SPEAKER_01]: of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to shake his hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to tell him that he does great
artwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got to hang out with all those
dudes for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is always a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to that entire gang,
the comedians and J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schaub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Brennan Schaub for
bringing a show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was his hometown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: His mom was heckling him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would tell jokes and you could just
hear his mom giggle with pride.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to hear everybody laugh and then his
mom laugh a couple of extra times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would do the thing where you
kind of put your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the thumb across the throat like
you're killing somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fingers across the neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cut it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was giving his mom the look of
disapproval, the skeptical hippo eyebrows,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then giving her the cut it out,
mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just cute and it was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oh, come on, mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was funny because the crowd was in
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know it's his hometown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that that was his mom in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big old shout out to that whole gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gang, gang, buzz, buzz, culture,
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know what that means, then you're
in the gang with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also need to send a special shout out to
everybody at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody at that club treats myself and
whoever I bring like fucking royalty,
[SPEAKER_01]: like rock stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see a comedy show,
if you want to get some laughter,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to take somebody on a date,
if you've got somebody to take a business
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting or something like that and you
need to take them somewhere, go to
[SPEAKER_01]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go catch a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is you got to kind of shut
up for a little bit, but you can share
[SPEAKER_01]: that laughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the car ride on the way home,
you have a lot of things to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: because the comedians are going to bring
up points and you get to look at each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do I agree or do I disagree with
this person?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can talk about that in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go get some laughter, go have a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will create conversation with your
date, with your business partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a great fucking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all my friends at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, big shout out to Tall Clint for
being a cool comedy bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not my date.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's much easier than taking a fucking
date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after the Brendan Schaub show,
we were not done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to meet everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we walked about 15 minutes to the
Belko theater where we got to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: another comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little spent.
[SPEAKER_01]: My laughter muscles were done.
[SPEAKER_01]: My cheeks hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: My tummy was a little bit sore from
laughing so hard, but it was time to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more comedy going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to the Belko theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about the Belko theater before
on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, beautiful theater inside of the
Denver Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice, comfortable place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our seats, chilled out for a couple
of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made the announcement that no phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get your phone out, you are
leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically is what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the lights went out and this young
man by the name of Jeff Tate came out and
[SPEAKER_01]: did a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Tate is a very good comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've heard me speak of him
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Jeff Tate from Queensryche.
[SPEAKER_01]: A different Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came out, he did a few minutes,
told a couple of jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was mostly funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, the man, the myth,
the legend, the fucking offensive one,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Tom Segura came out and blew the roof
off of the Belko theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say he blew the roof off of
the place because he's mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't get real fired up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you see Rogan, Rogan yells at
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see Joey Diaz, Diaz yells at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Segura has more of a mellow,
slower delivery with kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: condescending tone to it that just hits in
a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of being yelled some crazy shit
that makes you laugh after the idea is
[SPEAKER_01]: pounded into your head, he'll say
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could say a normal sentence and then
think of a normal sentence that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just add two words to it,
with my dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes every sentence creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you say, if you add the words
with my dick to the end of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fucking subtle and it's gross and
everybody gets that it's a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll just say something and that's not a
Tom Segura joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm killing his ideas of jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll tell you a story and then end it
with my dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when everybody gets a huge laugh
and his stories are fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be offended, please check
out some Tom Segura comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will piss you off in the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite kind of comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see Brennan Shaw, Derek Poston,
Assange Ahmad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see Jeff Tate and I got to see
Tom Segura.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was honestly blown away by Derek Poston.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't give him enough credit and enough
props.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention for Derek Poston.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is going to blow you away in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Tom Segura was the highlight of
the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we headed back to the car,
bumped into a friend on the way to the
[SPEAKER_01]: car, got to give a good friend a hug just
randomly, walking down the street in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver and there was a beautiful friend
said, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gave her a hug, kept walking, got to the
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: We headed back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normal evening, great safe drive home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Clint for being a great
comedy buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given him a shout out on the show for
that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, let's go to more comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey Coco Diaz is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're at the Joey show, I look forward
to seeing you at the Paramount Theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that is wrapping up the
comedy adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's on my mind that I went
there and it was fucking awesome,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's talk about this quick road trip I
took.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple of days ago, I drove to
Evergreen, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only place I really mentioned that is
because holy shit, it was beautiful and I
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot stop thinking of the way the place
felt and smelled and just the vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the energy there, it was really
calming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really peaceful and it was so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first kind of cool day in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have my hoodie on,
but I kind of wish I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I enjoyed that brisk, cool mountain
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no traffic up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of beautiful animals, lots of
beautiful scenery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody I spoke to in Evergreen was
like, hey buddy, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you having as beautiful of a day as I
am?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just fucking excellent up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Evergreen, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't move there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just keep it fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take like 47 dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're actually going to get into the
cannabis portion of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab with me, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, boys and girls, ladies and
gentlemen, pimps and hoes, smokers and
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, friends and foes, friends and
fam, I am back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time to get into the email portion
of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first email for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I hope everything
is going ire for you on this lovely
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading this on a Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are probably listening on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything still ire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes on to say, my name is,
oh, let's skip that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you want your name said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, my name is blank and I am 22 and
I've been growing for about four years
[SPEAKER_01]: total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started at my parents' house growing
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I got to having 10 three foot
tall plants in one area, was when I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that I have a passion for growing
cannabis and I want to go about this
[SPEAKER_01]: legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very common story.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people start growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They realize that it is very fulfilling in
many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, you have your own cannabis that
you grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is absolutely instantly gratifying
and rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is something that comes with
growing your own cannabis that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people have a passion for
producing their own product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend here quickly realized that
they have a passion for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted to go about it legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the message continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I attended a hands-on certified
cannabis college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shortly after, I applied for a grow
position at, and I'm not going to say the
[SPEAKER_01]: name of the company, but they applied for
a position and got hired on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went to a certified cannabis college
to give yourself some credentials there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you went and applied and you were
hired immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's find where I was in the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, so I moved from one location to
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to leave out your locations
because I want to keep you safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who may hear this down the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to put you in any jeopardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to keep all your locations
and names kind of secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it says, I've moved locations since
then, and that's where this new business
[SPEAKER_01]: is located.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been here for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now leading a building with multiple
rooms that are this size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say that because those
are too many clues.
[SPEAKER_01]: If other people hear this, they'll know
that this is you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I've got 100 or so plants in each
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I average 80 to 90 pounds of dry weight
per 18 HPS lights per room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying you get 80 to 90 pounds
out of 18 HPS lamps per room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really curious how long you're
vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really curious how you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep water culture, hydro-soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you on tables?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know about your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to do the math in my head
quickly while I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's over three pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 3.6 pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to pull out a
calculator here and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what this says.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to divide 90 pounds divided by
18 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's five pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I did poor math in my head there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got five pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to believe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't sound very likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be completely honest, man, I only know
what this company has taught me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from some of the old heads,
with that being said, I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: good, decent, or super bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were genuinely pulling four to
five, maybe six pounds per light,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I can't see the quality of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're even trimming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be fluffy and larpy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could pull you five pounds per light if
I don't trim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if anybody wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do math again just to make
sure I did that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 pounds divided by 18 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking five pounds a light,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very unlikely, very uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be getting bonuses and a lot of
money if you were doing that for the
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say it's unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking unheard of, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to push for two, maybe three
pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five pounds is a little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats if you're really pulling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to see the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see how it's trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see how many sticks and stems
are left in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doubting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just questioning you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a slight difference, not much
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, he doesn't know if he's doing
good, decent, or super bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your harvest weight is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you anything else about the
quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, With that being said,
I know now that legalization in Florida is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up and I have two investors which
believe in me and they want to open a shop
[SPEAKER_01]: once the laws allow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Florida is about to legalize,
it sounds like, and he's got some people
[SPEAKER_01]: behind him and this guy wants to open up
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's working for somebody now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pulling good weight, but he's got
some investors that want to pull him away
[SPEAKER_01]: and give him his own building.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like this is a common thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called recruiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what I call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Am I approaching the industry the
right way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I get any specific degrees?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I at a disadvantage for only knowing
how to grow commercially?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't think any specific degree
would help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some kind of business degree because
you're going to need to learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage business and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just if you're involved in the business,
you want to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe go to school just for the basics of
business and understand that so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get in business, people with
degrees, they can rip you off just on
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose and there's not shit you can do
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could do it in a contract right in
front of you and they'll say, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: where I fuck you and you'll sign the paper
because you don't know that that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: they wrote, this is where I fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn a little bit about business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, are you screwing yourself by only
knowing how to grow commercially?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are meant to be a commercial grower if
that's what this new business is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, so focus on commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dial it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn as much as you can, every aspect of
commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like if you're really pulling
the weight that you have typed here in
[SPEAKER_01]: these numbers, it sounds like you've got
commercial growing figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you can pull 90 pounds out of the
room, but if you don't trim it,
[SPEAKER_01]: dry it, cure it and package it and get it
to the store and it doesn't sell by the
[SPEAKER_01]: gram at 80 to 90 or 80, 90 pounds,
that cash doesn't come into the cash
[SPEAKER_01]: register.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't count, so being able to produce
that much, it's got to be quality as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really curious about that,
but learn how to function in a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to go from a stoner,
from a grower, from a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to step up your
mindset and start learning a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more business thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just managing your own, but also
working with other business owners and
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be playing with a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to not take the money and the
pressure as stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about it as this is what I'm
doing and I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confident, so we will be successful,
but at the same time, know how to make
[SPEAKER_01]: wise decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to do a lot of
thinking and a lot of planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend any specific degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about a lot of things and open
your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step out of the closet grower or the small
mind cultivator and start thinking a
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollar cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you're doing, you just have to
dial in every detail a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it stress you that much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just step up your game that much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it scare you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it make you better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue with the email
because obviously these dabs going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking rambly today, so let me find my
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, am I approaching the industry the
right way?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're learning commercial
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pulling 80 to 90 dry pounds out
of 18 lines, you are definitely figuring
[SPEAKER_01]: out commercial cultivation, specific
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to conduct yourself as a
business person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn about HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn about all the electrical ins and
outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn about the entire business from the
ground up, from seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn every aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy to be involved in every
business meeting that happens with a
[SPEAKER_01]: business that you're involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you're the cultivator doesn't
mean that you don't need to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging meeting, that you shouldn't be
at some sort of a CEO meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to all that shit that you're allowed to
go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be welcome to all of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be involved in your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: See where the money's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be decisions that you're not
even involved in that you should have
[SPEAKER_01]: input in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have some involvement in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Involve yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Involve yourself in all aspects of the
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm going to try to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm fucking way rambly again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I at a disadvantage by only knowing how
to grow commercially?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just honestly want to know where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I write it out with this company or
should I not venture it out with them and
[SPEAKER_01]: have them as my competition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever worry about competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In business, there are always going to be
other businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how business works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without competition, you will fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be the only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your ego will get too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll run out of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something will go wrong if you're the only
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a little competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't tell you where to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you if you want to stay in
the facility in which you're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: now or if you want to step out to another
facility and take the reins and have that
[SPEAKER_01]: much more control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that much more responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to learn how to
juggle that in your own life where that
[SPEAKER_01]: fits in for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't go in thinking that anybody is
your competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make an enemy mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make a battlefield mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be different businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be doing things differently,
but we all have the same goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you do end up on the other
team, we are all headed to the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mount Everest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain climbers aren't competing against
anybody but themselves, even though there
[SPEAKER_01]: are other climbers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give a shit what the other
climbers are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to get to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: If another climber falls, they're going to
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not worried about,
oh, that climber is going up the mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: more quickly than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just say, I'm going to get to the top
when I get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about the other climbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do your fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes for just about everything in
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't compete with anybody but yourself
because you are your only gauge of your
[SPEAKER_01]: own success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows what the other people have
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may look like they're winning the
race, but they may have shit their pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they win the race with shit in
their pants, they still lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you didn't shit your pants and you
win the race second place, you win.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't judge your success by anybody
else's success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because they're doing something
differently doesn't mean they're winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person is wondering if they should
branch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they want to know, is my
knowledge that I know now enough to have
[SPEAKER_01]: my own little successful shop in the
future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what you know from
the size of the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you were running.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got multiple rooms that are a good
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got quite a few plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were running with this math.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're running close to 2000 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many people you have
helping you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is a multi-person
facility or a one-man show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing that on yourself,
on your own, I would rely on you to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: quality lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably lead a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could certainly manage a decent size
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do whatever you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the things you were telling me are
accurate, if you're pulling 80 to 90
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds at 18 lights, you're doing better
than most professional cultivators in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of facilities that have been around
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to boost up your ego because
I have not seen the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pass lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you understand pesticide applications
and pesticide safety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you compliant?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of other things to think
about, but that is all legal stuff that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen to you if you choose to
work with your own company or stay with
[SPEAKER_01]: the folks you're working with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't make business decisions for you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, my family has always frowned upon
cannabis and I want to make the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: and prove them wrong that I can be a
successful young man while cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I admire your passion that you want
to be a successful cannabis cultivator,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's not do something just to prove
somebody wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prove yourself right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prove your passion is what you should be
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you want to do to make your life
happy for yourself, not to prove anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big waste of time because they're
not spending their energy proving you
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong on shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've moved on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't waste your energy doing something
to prove anybody wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you're doing to show what you are
passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prove it to yourself that you can do what
you set your mind and heart to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So set some goals and reach those goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps up the message by saying,
I respect your craft immensely and I am
[SPEAKER_01]: very eager to hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really gave some weird advice because I
can't tell you what to do with your
[SPEAKER_01]: personal life and with your business life
and with your career.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the options are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only see a couple of words on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see the long-term effects that
this will have on your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make sort of a flow chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this may sound silly for some people,
but this is what successful people will
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Draw a chart and say, if I choose decision
A, what will my life be like in one week,
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks, six weeks, two months,
three months, six months?
[SPEAKER_01]: What will my life be like one year from
today if I make decision A?
[SPEAKER_01]: What will my life be like in two years,
three years, five years, 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about what your life will be like in
a certain amount of time from decision A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then do the same damn thing for decision
B.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is best for you and what is best for
your family and what is what you really
[SPEAKER_01]: want?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to decide right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, hopefully you've got a few
minutes to sit back and think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a clear head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a really clear head and think about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put in your head whatever you like to
put in your head and think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to smoke a fatty, smoke a
fatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to drink a beer, drink a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to eat some mushrooms,
eat those damn mushrooms and think this
[SPEAKER_01]: decision through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then clear your head again and make a
solid decision when you got a clear head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about it completely sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get fucking wacky out of your
brain and think about it real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sleep on it for a couple nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back to it nice and crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a good decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you what to do with your
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wish that I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is exciting to team up with investors
and create your own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are attaching your entire life to that
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will wake up and be that business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will fall asleep being that business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are responsible for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are basically having another child if
you start this business with other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are working with a company that is
established, that has owners, that has
[SPEAKER_01]: people that handle that part, you have a
lot of the stress taken off your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you have a lot of the paycheck taken
off your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of the pride and a lot of
the say-so taken off of your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to decide what makes you
happiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't want to make a personal or
a career decision for one of my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give you words of encouragement
and make you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hope that you make the best
decision for yourself and for your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank you for listening to
the show because you have been a long-time
[SPEAKER_01]: listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been emailing back and forth for
quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sent me this email a little bit back,
so I hope I'm not too late with the reply,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do appreciate the support and I do
know that you helped me out on the Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give you an extra fist bump and
an extra thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be confident that you will make the
correct decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I just thought of is this
cannabis industry is ever-changing and
[SPEAKER_01]: ever-evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a passionate and an educated
cannabis grower and you are always going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have some sort of a spot in the
commercial cultivation industry if you
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a very qualified commercial grower
and I don't spend a long time in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: facility because things rotate in this
industry so drastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are a skilled cultivator and you
can present yourself well, if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: write a resume, if you can interview well,
you will never be without a job in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cultivation industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you decide that you don't like the way
a facility is ran or that an owner is
[SPEAKER_01]: implementing a new rule or maybe an
investor is being cheap and not buying the
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate equipment, you can leave that
facility and find employment at another
[SPEAKER_01]: facility in a very short amount of time
once the industry is established.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually very easy when the industry
is new because everybody needs a qualified
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be too afraid to jump in
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you need to do for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn, learn that style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every facility does something different
just because that's how they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a lead cultivator that set it
up with an idea or they've got an owner
[SPEAKER_01]: that set it up with an idea and you've got
to adapt to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will learn things in every
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be afraid to leave something for
something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are stable and secure and you
need to take care of a family,
[SPEAKER_01]: always keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are jobs in the commercial
cultivation industry and when one ends,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's always another one available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful of your reputation because
the community does get quite small quite
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know each other in this cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is a giant state, but I know
folks from Fort Collins down to Trinidad
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is each end of our state from
north to south.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get in the car and drive to every
city and get out of the car and walk into
[SPEAKER_01]: a dispensary and high five a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to toot my horn and say I
know a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is everybody in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know if you're in the industry,
we all basically know each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are industry nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's budtender nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cultivator night.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of there are all kinds
of events that keep us all connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like any other industry,
we are a bunch of gossipy bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep your reputation clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your passion up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your education sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay on top of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay on top of the methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay on top of the pesticide rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay ever evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you don't tarnish your
reputation and cause a major problem and
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the industry aren't blaming you
for a major failure or a bunch of fuck up
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere, you should always have gainful
employment in the cannabis industry if you
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there may not have been a lot of direct
advice for this situation, but I hope I
[SPEAKER_01]: gave a lot of useful life advice for you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everything goes well for you down
there in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please reach out and let me know that you
heard this response on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to your email, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody else out there has a
cultivation question, a cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_01]: question, or they just want to reach out
and say hello, my email address is
[SPEAKER_01]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I look forward to hearing
from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I do have another
email here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
first of all, thanks for the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: content, which you were providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is truly appreciated and helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for saying thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like a big recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I listened to the show every day
while working and I have learned so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hitting my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to teach people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says English is not my native language.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excuse me in advance if you have a hard
time reading this.
Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big compliment because so far your English
is better than most Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good job there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, I am on my first grow
using LED lighting and a grow tent that is
[SPEAKER_01]: in my room in my apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tent is 23 inches by 60 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got about two feet by two feet by
five feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, I am concerned about
light leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have listened to your podcast and I know
light leaks are something to be careful
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know that a tent needs good
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these things are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have our plants in their dark
period, we need to keep the dark period
[SPEAKER_01]: under uninterrupted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means zero light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is any light on that plant,
you are going to have problems that will
[SPEAKER_01]: give you potential hermaphrodites,
which will mess up your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is undesirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want zero light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely zero light.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people say, is this too much light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to go in there and close your
eyes and put your hand directly in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of your face and not be able to see your
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to wait for like 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want your eyes to adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to look around and look for
little leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any little prick holes in the
material where light's coming in?
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot have any light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero light leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an absolute thing to be concerned
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person also said that they need
correct ventilation, which is absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have been listening to the show
and I am proud of them so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says right now, my seedlings are
getting fresh air from the bottom of my
[SPEAKER_01]: tent, which has the classic duct holes in
and out for aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I simply put a fan in front of the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just blowing air straight into
the little mesh right there, which works
[SPEAKER_01]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: That mesh is going to slow down the wind
so it doesn't disturb the seedlings too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, and we're going to get some air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far we're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes on to say, but when it's
time for flowering, I'm going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: shut down this vent so the light won't
come in because my tent is in a room which
[SPEAKER_01]: can be illuminated sometimes because I
store things in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a common problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have our grow tents in rooms where
we have to frequently turn off the regular
[SPEAKER_01]: light in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also goes on to say, what about fresh
air?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got to close up the vents,
but they are now concerned about fresh air
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't want light coming in
through that bottom flap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, how is the fresh air going to
enter the tent?
[SPEAKER_01]: This may sound like an ultimate noob
question, but I really do not know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: solve this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes on with maybe, is it possible
in a small tent like this that I don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: a fan?
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I plan to grow two plants and
I want to keep them pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not care at all about having a huge
yield with great taste or shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually do not smoke, but I want to
grow some high CBD plants with my very
[SPEAKER_01]: occasional migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're growing CBD plants to help with
migraines and also just growing because I
[SPEAKER_01]: love the plant and I love growing outdoors
or indoors, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this person is just growing basically
for the passion of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could just be an act of civil
disobedience if they are in an illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: place, which I would definitely admire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to wrap it up and we'll
answer the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I made myself clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually listening to your podcast helps
also a lot in learning English.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your English is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did better than most Americans do with
their emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your message was very easy to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the idea that I am helping
you learn English.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think that I speak fairly well
for a lazy American.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're learning well from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps it up with cheers from France.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I may be a bit paranoid,
so please do not use my name because weed
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption and cultivation are highly
prohibited here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't say your name at all,
but big thank you for the email and big
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you and fist bump for your act of
civil disobedience by illegally
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating your medicine there in the
great country of France.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about now how
to get air into that tent once we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: close that vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the light does not come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of simple solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely recommend some sort of
an extraction fan on the top of that tent
[SPEAKER_01]: to remove the heat and humidity from the
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a way to get that old air out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the general way to do that is to put
an extraction fan at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is probably a hole or a duct or a
port on the top of that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would put a blower up there sucking
air out and it would just pull the hot air
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that little tent and it would just
dump it into that room, into the bedroom
[SPEAKER_01]: or into the storage room where you've got
the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as that fan or that blower pulls air
up to the top of that tent and out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the tent, it is going to need to
replace the air somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That air will need to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tent will crush in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That negative pressure is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about this in another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tent will cave in just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the pressure gets strong enough,
the air will start flowing through the
[SPEAKER_01]: gaps in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are gaps in the zipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are gaps in little spots in the tent
that the air will find its way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will suck right through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you don't have to Velcro those flaps
down completely tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can Velcro them down to where the
light doesn't get through, but they can
[SPEAKER_01]: still be open enough to where the air can
pass through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need the fan blowing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put a fan sucking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fan will remove your humidity and
that fan will also remove excess heat and
[SPEAKER_01]: that fan at the same time will help draw
air in through that passive vent on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom and keep recycling and refreshing
the air in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now keep in mind, you can only refresh it
with the air that is available in that
[SPEAKER_01]: storage room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how often that air gets
exchanged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how large that room is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be decent because you're growing
in there, but keep in mind that that room
[SPEAKER_01]: is what is supplying your grow tent with
all of its environmental and atmospheric
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your CO2, your oxygen, your temperature,
your humidity, they're all coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is going to have a lot to do with
the climate inside of that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do need to worry about the light
leaks, but I think if you just let the
[SPEAKER_01]: flap down and Velcro it at the corners,
but don't do it all the way across the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom, then put an extraction fan at the
top, maybe a four inch fan, a four inch
[SPEAKER_01]: blower, like a squirrel cage blower or a
four inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an extraction fan to go at the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just set it right on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably doesn't weigh too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just set right on top and rest
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it to where it is sucking air out and
that's going to dump the air into your
[SPEAKER_01]: storage area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that will also make the air flow
through that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come right through the passive vents
in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also come through the gaps in the
zipper, through any gaps in the stitching.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll go right up out of the top and
then it'll just recycle into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I would try to keep the lights on
minimally in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that you have to visit that
room to get things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say here that it's used as a storage
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to get in there
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe try to plan your lights off schedule
around times when you're sleeping or times
[SPEAKER_01]: that you won't have to visit that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to think about what hours of the day
do I go into that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake up at this time of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to bed at this time of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's only, it's probably 16 hours of
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably sleeping eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only got to think about four hours
that we don't want to go in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe cut four hours at this end of the
day or four hours at this end of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: and time it around that to where you don't
have to interrupt that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of being a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to plan around that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just try to schedule your lights off
time around times that you won't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn on that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, most of the time those tents are
well enough made where we won't get much
[SPEAKER_01]: light leakage.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good way to see if you are getting a
light leak is to turn off the lights in
[SPEAKER_01]: your storage room, turn on the lights in
the grow tent, seal the tent up like
[SPEAKER_01]: normal and just hang out for a few minutes
in that dark room and see if any little
[SPEAKER_01]: pricks of light come shining out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see little dots of light,
you may need to put a piece of duct tape
[SPEAKER_01]: or something over that just to stop light
from going the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also keep in mind the light in your
storage area is nowhere near as bright as
[SPEAKER_01]: the light inside of your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's making it out, it still may not
be making it in because that light is
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere near as intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like the main solution is
going to be putting a small blower at the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we can suck air out and at the
same time pull air in and also try to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust our lighting, our daily schedule
around our lighting schedule of our grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tent so we don't cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand sometimes that's a struggle,
but the tent should be well made enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: where we don't get light leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, then we can use some duct tape
or something similar to plug up any light
[SPEAKER_01]: leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we don't get hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we don't ruin the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we can have a successful grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I think you can hear
my throat burning out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is time to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank our friend for sending us
