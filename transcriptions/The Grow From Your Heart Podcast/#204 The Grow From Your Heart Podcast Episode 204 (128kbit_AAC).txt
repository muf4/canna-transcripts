[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back with a chunk of old episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, we're doing episodes 32,
33, 34, and 35 of what used to be known as
[SPEAKER_02]: the iGrow Culture Podcast, currently known
as the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This file is going to be really long,
so I'll keep this intro short.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the social media stuff has been
updated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love it if you follow me on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: The correct and updated email address is
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: FromYourHeart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado,
here are episodes 32, 33, 34, and 35 of
[SPEAKER_02]: what used to be the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 32 of the
iGrow Culture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me today on the mic, we got our
buddy Adam with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanging out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a big shout out to our
buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was supposed to come join us on the
show today, but Mike, he hurt himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hurt his back, so he's laid up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taken a night off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good feeling better, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get well, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take some dabs for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, on the last episode, I said that I
was going to make videos of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making a video is a big pain in the ass,
and it really detracts from the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: the show, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was too distracted by toys and
equipment, and I wasn't able to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: good podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've decided to not make videos of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I will do is keep making cheesy ass
YouTube videos with iMovie, and just put
[SPEAKER_02]: up videos that are mostly still shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some video in there,
but it'll mostly be stills of stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: is involved in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take pictures of rigs, pictures of
plants, pictures of the guests,
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be stuff like that, because doing a
video really wasn't very fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fade out this music here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat and Coot and the
Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me play your music on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys follow the Mystic Roots
Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of putting pictures of rigs up,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got a new rig today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to at LSD Gallery on
Instagram, and also big shout out to at
[SPEAKER_02]: Slugworth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Slugworth Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have researched that,
but check out Slugworth Glass,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they're called on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tweet a link to that so you can
find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered the Master Shake Rig from LSD
Gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little smaller than I expected,
but boy, do I approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came with this super awesome chainsaw
dabber here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this little handle here,
they're encouraging me to wear this as a
[SPEAKER_02]: pendant, is what I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this rig is certainly designed to be
worn as a pendant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing, I think Adam said,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three inches tall?
[SPEAKER_02]: About three inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about three inches tall,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm super satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are looking for good glass
that will get shipped to you at a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable price from good people that do
good business, the glass is thicker than
[SPEAKER_02]: it looks like it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not clear, so you can't see the
thickness of the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the straw and see even
the handles and stuff, it is thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you handle it, you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Master Shake Rig is stylish,
super stylish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well worth every penny I spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got shipped here super quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went out the day after I paid for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid for it on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a tracking number when I woke up
Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you need glass, check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called at LSD Gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a big shout out to Task Rock because
when I ordered my new rig, of course I had
[SPEAKER_02]: to get, it's a little 10 millimeter rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my first 10 mil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the bigger stuff, honestly,
but this little one is cute and I love the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be my new, just when I'm dabbing
by myself, that'll be my new personal rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got myself a purple carb cap and a
little 10 millimeter Trinitide nail to put
[SPEAKER_02]: on my rig and it works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: At LSD Gallery and at Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at Slugworth Class.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to research the Slugworth one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that you're there, let's just do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is brought to you by our good
friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using high quality concentrates,
like I know most of you are, you deserve a
[SPEAKER_02]: high quality titanium nail made in
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trust a Chinese knockoff or an
American knockoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want that crap that's made out
of cheap metals.

[SPEAKER_02]: Trust our good friends at Highly Educated
Titanium.

part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big love, much respect to Highly
Educated Titanium.

Titanium products, you can check out our

stuff in stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Colorado, this place does not
pay me, but you'd go check out Illusion's
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass on Broadway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to take... Adam hasn't been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone to Denver several times
together and I have not taken you to
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion's.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm probably in the market of
purchasing rigs, so I may need a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to ask you earlier where I
can pick one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion's Glass in Denver does carry
Highly Educated products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all kinds of sick glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a glass shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a written commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I owe a dollar because I just said
the F word again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys get me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting on episode 30, every time I say
the F word, I owe a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are going to hold me to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, to the charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time we get to episode 35,
I'll start doing $5 every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to stop saying the F word.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lit by me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it doesn't... There are some
listeners that it does not slip by.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for listening and making
some money for the person that's sick that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually needs some money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great way to do it.

talker.

speech.

[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go and take down your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to make you use your real

that have fake names or not even fake
[SPEAKER_02]: names, just pseudo names.

find me on the forum, come join my forum.

[SPEAKER_02]: I've been posting the notes from the
podcast.

I'll actually put it there on the forum so
[SPEAKER_02]: people can check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I encourage you to interact with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there's Facebook, Hygro Culture
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds like I'm just plugging the
show again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're going to take a quick dab and
then we will be back for the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we take dabs, I'm just going to turn
up the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some Mystic Roots band playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a $100 bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a $100 bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to take a dab real quick
on this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the mic's on, so you can hear
Adam Coss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, I've got to say a big
shout out to Bender and 420th.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing it while I'm away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And held it down while I couldn't be on
the internet and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the people back out East.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Murphy's Grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who you are, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of the guys from the 420th just found
out that I've been on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just thought I was spamming your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, man, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stoned when I wrote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should make a little bit of sense,
at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chokefest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a big shout out to Bender as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bender, if you're listening, thanks,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made me three logos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all three of them look sweet as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you more shout outs on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best I can do for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the long run, we'll make it up to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ask for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just volunteered and made me some
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics logos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, how about an I Grow Culture logo
that I can make a sticker out of?
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put the request in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just tell him that he should listen
to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even tell him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tell him if he listens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That music was loud while we were talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're taking some dabs of stuff blasted
by my good buddy at Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Garden of Weed-en on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm coughing after a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I hope you're taking dabs with us
while we're dabbing on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using those highly educated nails.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that tasty?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's some golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to hit the Hitman rig because
hitting that little mini slug worth would
[SPEAKER_02]: just make us cough for an hour on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what I was just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you said we were doing that,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I slipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were in a dab world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had that dab bubble around your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's going to be all right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just give him a minute to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You there?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, they also, they follow me on
Instagram and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just call your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think it'll make the podcast
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting here with, can I say your
name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss G, we're sitting here with your son
and he's dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could just talk him
down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing is I'll sit here and I'll
encourage people like, yeah, go follow him
[SPEAKER_02]: and troll the shit out of her,
you know, on Facebook, but I don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want people to troll your mom?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom doesn't have any social media and
I'm glad about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty glad about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we're just rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a personal conversation
because we just took dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather talk, have just some rambles
that are incoherent instead of trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: read the news while I'm choking over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little intermission.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to go, probably Monday,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should go up Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you guys like that bonus little
miniature episode that I put out Thursday
[SPEAKER_02]: night?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that cool or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go out tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one, as we're recording,
I'll post another one when we finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have this one going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm living in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're living in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to live in the now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you've got social media,
if you've got Facebook, if you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter, if you've got YouTube,
if you've watched TV in the past couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: days, you have seen the anchor lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, excuse my dollar on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, don't charge me a dollar for this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This lady went on TV and she made a nice
long speech and her speech ended with,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it, I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know who I'm talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if I could play the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I play the video and not get in
trouble?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the news played the hell out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's turn down the music and let's try to
play this video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I'm going to play a quick video and
you guys, this happened on the news and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I'll read the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to play it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a second, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to search for the actual good
quality video and I'll play it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little bit of searching.
[SPEAKER_02]: The video comes in kind of late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should fill you in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This lady, the news ran a report about
medical cannabis or cannabis in Alaska and
[SPEAKER_02]: this lady was reporting on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then during her report, she states
that she supports cannabis and that she
[SPEAKER_02]: actually is the owner of the Alaska
Cannabis Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of where just to get you
up to speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where she jumps in and I'll play
the video now and hopefully they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: take it off of all of the servers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you heard it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next lady on the news,
the camera pops back up to the other lady
[SPEAKER_02]: on the news and this lady, the other
co-host looks like she pissed her pants
[SPEAKER_02]: when she said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so this lady goes on the news and
she's a news reporter and you heard it
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit live on the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to get into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make a little more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anchor explains her dramatic exit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys don't charge me a dollar for all
of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just relaying the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I read who it's by?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I said who it's by.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by Molly Riley from the Huffington
Post.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to get me a dirty,
nasty, recycled jar to bring over here and
[SPEAKER_03]: sit on your table during these podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you feel dirty, even dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had to put it like, you have to
stick it to the bottom of the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The F jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The F jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says, the local news anchor who had
dramatically quit her job on air following
[SPEAKER_02]: a segment on marijuana explained her exit
in a YouTube video released Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlo Green, a reporter for Anchorage's
KTVA announced on air that she would be
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving her job at the TV station to focus
on marijuana legalization in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, they ran the clip about
cannabis and then she says this,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you've heard is why I,
the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Club will be dedicating all of my energy
toward fighting for freedom and fairness,
[SPEAKER_02]: which begins with legalizing marijuana
here in Alaska, she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for this job, well, not that I have
a choice, but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where she stirred up a lot of
controversy.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, in my opinion, the attention should
have been on her advocacy, her support,
[SPEAKER_02]: and her fight to legalize and support
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, she chose one wrong word on the
air on TV and distracted it from all of
[SPEAKER_02]: what she was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said the word that cost me a dollar on
the air, on TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Adam pointed it out that that TV
station is going to face a fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FCC is going to do something,
even if it was early morning and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: very small numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FCC goes from like 2,500 to like,
you know, 250,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll probably end up paying the fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they find her?
[SPEAKER_02]: But still that was rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her choice of words distracted from
her whole fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made her kind of look bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: She could have quit on air and probably
sent a better message, but it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have been heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have been heard so broadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would not have been heard by the
non-talk community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since everybody has seen this on... The
day it happened, I opened up my Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was all anybody had posted all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently she got herself popular the
way she was trying to do, but she could
[SPEAKER_02]: have done a little bit better of a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's also the, you know,
I'm not saying that the marijuana business
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to fail, but maybe she hits a
snafu and it kind of crumbles from
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe she trusts the wrong partner or
there's some kind of illegal... There's
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of things that could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from here on out, she's never getting
a reporting job again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're never getting on any kind
of cable access, let alone, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: making a comedy show, you know,
maybe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can come on our podcast whenever she'd
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the open invitation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep going with the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the YouTube clip, Greene explained why
she believes the fight for marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization in her home state is so
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There comes a time in each and every one
of our lives where we must choose to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to spectate or stand up for
what's right, she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are Americans arrested every 30
seconds, Alaskans every 4.3 hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should an aspiring someone lose their
ability to earn a higher education to
[SPEAKER_02]: become someone they were not meant to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why should you lose the ability to get
public assistance in times of struggle and
[SPEAKER_02]: need?
[SPEAKER_02]: She continued, advocating for freedom and
fairness should be everybody's duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making it my life work to uphold what
America stands for truly, life,
[SPEAKER_02]: liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideals now need to be defended.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree with her there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with her, but as I've been told
numerous times throughout my life,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not what you do, it's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as hearing it over and over again is
you shouldn't have said F, you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have said, fuck, you shouldn't have said
this, you know, I hear it constantly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if that's the type of person who you
are and you're able to stand up to that
[SPEAKER_02]: scrutiny, I'm, I'll back that,
you know, I'm not the type of person to
[SPEAKER_02]: bite my tongue, especially if you cross me
and I felt like I haven't done anything
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they were going to fire her,
fuck that company, you know, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't going to fire her until she
said that she owned that cannabis club and
[SPEAKER_02]: why then?
[SPEAKER_02]: She was legit anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a backup job, so she could have
just said, and I, since that's probably my
[SPEAKER_02]: last report, so it was nice seeing you
guys have a good night, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of fuck it, I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wouldn't have blown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it wouldn't have blown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you had the opportunity to go on
the news in front of camera, would you
[SPEAKER_02]: rather say, and tonight I respectfully
design, or would you rather be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you suck, you suck, you suck, fuck it,
I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but you being my friend would
kind of stand back and say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't be you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last line of the article says
Alaskans are set to vote on ballot measure
[SPEAKER_02]: two, which would legalize possession of
small amounts of marijuana for
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational use in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado and Washington have implemented
similar legislation in the last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck have they been doing up
there?
[SPEAKER_08]: They've made it against the law to like
drink in separate counties.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was ballot initiative one,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And ballot initiative two is to maybe
legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, did you hear the ratio a minute ago
when it was like every 30 seconds an
[SPEAKER_02]: American is arrested for pot in every 4.3
minutes in- 4.3 hours in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, what a big fucking ratio.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they doing up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Arresting moose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all after the moose knuckles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moose knuckles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully they legalize possession
of small amounts of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small amounts of marijuana for
recreational use in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would give us a lot less to watch on
Alaskan state troopers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys tweet me what you think about this
lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you think about this lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more to contribute to our
conversation, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be glad to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add to it, add to the conversation,
keep the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did she screw herself by using the
language she did or did she actually help
[SPEAKER_02]: herself out by using that language?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please comment because see, I'm on the
border of I'm down with saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it, I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then all my friends who have
respectable businesses and, and
[SPEAKER_02]: respectable things would be like,
no, you really should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's usually afterwards, you know,
it's usually at this point in time where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably shouldn't have done that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times have I said that to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to strike a lot, a lot more than
my parents did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took you a lot less time to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm good after that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I say, bro, do you realize that
you're just about to put nitro and
[SPEAKER_02]: glycerin in the same container and shake
it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see that coming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you go, oh yeah, I had nitro and
glycerin in the same container.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once I warn you, you're pretty on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been guilty to fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got to fail to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many, if you try stuff and you do it
perfectly, you're like, I'm fucking good
[SPEAKER_02]: at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a dollar for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do something and you fail,
you're like, boy, I'm humbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to learn how to do this,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't learn anything the first time
you get stuff right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where'd that article go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam actually brought this article to my
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's written by Jeremy P. Meyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found this on the denverpost.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Colorado schools out millions due
to marijuana excise tax loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not, they're not out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds like they had millions in
their pockets and somebody reached in and
[SPEAKER_02]: took it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the way this went.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little misleading, but they have to
do that with headlines to get you to read
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The schools did get kind of punked a
little bit, but it wasn't a loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a business move and it wasn't aimed
at, nobody was like, let's screw the
[SPEAKER_02]: schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just what business people were
doing because it's how business was being
[SPEAKER_02]: done at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: How the law was wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says a loophole built into
Colorado's marijuana system has allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of pounds of pot to go untaxed
and has cost the state millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: that should have gone to school
construction fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2012, Colorado voters overwhelmingly
approved amendment 64, which among other
[SPEAKER_02]: things, promised that the first $40
million in excise tax revenue would be
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated every year for the state school
construction fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year only about $10 million is
expected to be raised thanks to a rule
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows marijuana retailers to avoid
paying the tax and a one-time transfer of
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesale pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had to clear my face there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely revenue will increase over time as
the industry continues to mature and fewer
[SPEAKER_02]: license holders are able to use the
one-time tax free transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they're able to do, I haven't read
far enough into the article here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what they're able to do, shops that
have medical marijuana are able to move it
[SPEAKER_02]: from their medical marijuana side to the
recreational marijuana side to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: available for everybody instead of just
medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there must be a tax paid when that
happens because the taxes are different on
[SPEAKER_02]: the medical side and the rec side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Colorado tried to protect the medical
side a little bit by doing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in my opinion, it has failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll continue into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether the excise tax revenue will ever
reach 40 million is anyone's guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: My suspicion is the amount will never be
attained as and was a pie in the sky
[SPEAKER_02]: figure meant to attract voters.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that sounds familiar, you may be
remembering the 2008 campaign for
[SPEAKER_02]: amendment 50 that promised 182 million
over five years to community colleges from
[SPEAKER_02]: the expansion of gaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, only 25.3 million has been
generated through the fiscal year,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012 to 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: After people are spending their money on
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The marijuana excise tax revenues would
certainly grow if the loophole that was
[SPEAKER_02]: created by regulators to launch the
industry was closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are still 275 license holders who
could take advantage of it according to
[SPEAKER_02]: one source.
[SPEAKER_02]: The loophole was created to make sure
enough pot would be in the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace when doors opened on January
1st, 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulators allowed medical marijuana
licensees converting to retail a one-time
[SPEAKER_02]: tax-free transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That transfer was a big difference between
Colorado and Washington, the other state
[SPEAKER_02]: that legalized retail marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had to reread that sentence
because it looked weird to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something didn't sound right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But okay, that transfer was a big
difference between Colorado, was the big
[SPEAKER_02]: difference is what it should say,
between Colorado and Washington,
[SPEAKER_02]: the other state that legalized retail
marijuana and why the Centennial state was
[SPEAKER_02]: out the door first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington had to grow its retail crop
from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado officials say 9,711 pounds of
medical pot was transferred tax-free to
[SPEAKER_02]: retail stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,724 pounds of medical marijuana was
moved to retail marijuana products and
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers and 8,576 pounds of medical
pot was transferred to retail marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: That last tranche will be subject to the
tax once it is transferred or sold to
[SPEAKER_02]: another marijuana establishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be taxes made on this,
just not that original transfer tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says, it is estimated that the
untaxed pot would have provided $3 million
[SPEAKER_02]: for the state school construction fund or
twice what the fund received in the fiscal
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy Gerpar, a member of the public
school capital construction assistance
[SPEAKER_02]: board.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of words for a board.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big title.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A board that provides grants for schools
construction and renovation knew the
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers were going to be low after seeing
February's receipts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first month we were thinking we were
going to be rolling in cash, she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the second month it was, wait a
minute, we're only getting fractions of
[SPEAKER_02]: what we thought were we were going to get
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not the voter intent,
she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone who voted for
amendment 64 thought this would happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought the money would go to school
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming at the expensive kids in
really needy school districts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the text is broken up oddly with
ads here, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The building excellent schools today or
best fund is a competitive grant program
[SPEAKER_02]: that helps districts with capital
construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is able to support projects in rural
school districts that don't have large
[SPEAKER_02]: property basis necessary for bond
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best fund over the years has received
more than $385 million in revenue,
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% from the state land trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, the best fund is helping
construction buildings in the Edson 54 JT
[SPEAKER_02]: school district and supporting projects in
dozens of school districts around the
[SPEAKER_02]: state for things like roof replacements
and boilers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana taxes are providing less than 1%
of the program's funds or $3.1 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have made a big difference,
she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether there is a tax credit on the other
side, there is somebody to whom the tax
[SPEAKER_02]: credit should have gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposition AA, which was approved by
voters in 2013, mandates a 15% excise tax
[SPEAKER_02]: imposed on unprocessed retail marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: But amendment 64 says no excise taxes can
be charged on pot cultivated as medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: A transfer logically of medically grown
pot could be taxed, which is the basis for
[SPEAKER_02]: the loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simple solution then is to discontinue
transfers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state doesn't need them anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: The retail pot industry is up and running
now and doesn't need the influx of medical
[SPEAKER_02]: pot to prop up retail stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, transfers disadvantage retail
growers who have to pay the tax when
[SPEAKER_02]: medical growers don't for that one time
swap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never our intent to manipulate the
market, said Rep Dan Pabon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a correction that needs to be made.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said also a draft bill already had been
written that would stop the transfer after
[SPEAKER_02]: January 1st, 2016, but the loophole should
be closed sooner to match the voter's
[SPEAKER_02]: intent and make good on a promise that the
revenue should be going to schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: The revenue should go to the schools,
but... Where's the other money going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did it get exempt from the schools?
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand 40 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 million sounds like a lot, but did we
not make 40 million in the first 48 hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in total sales, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they're saying is they had this
tax set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tax was supposed to go here,
and the money didn't happen because these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys found a way to not make the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read that article not that long ago
where it was $1.9 million of taxable money
[SPEAKER_02]: from this county alone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's set up to go to different
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fund, this one is the one that didn't
happen because they said this money right
[SPEAKER_02]: here specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was the one was like, yeah,
cut the kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the council was like, I got a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even aimed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of this rule was set up to
help them have enough herb for when the
[SPEAKER_02]: shops opened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was also, they said, when this
money is made, it's going to the schools,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then it just didn't get made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was really like, fuck that fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck those kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how it worked out that they
found a way around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I told you... It would be nice if they
were like, all right, we cut we were
[SPEAKER_02]: expecting maybe $100 million for the first
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the best schools anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, just take this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year's us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll divvy it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop that common core shit and get on with
your fucking lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the rest of the country that you were
the high ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree that they should change
the rule by 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the shops are doing it right,
they don't need to move herb around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're growing medical herb,
it needs to be there for the patients.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't really purposely screw the
kids out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how... Like if I told you,
if you drive around the block every day on
[SPEAKER_02]: your work, you don't have to pay the $3
toll fee, but that $3 toll fee goes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: school kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd still drive around the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't give a shit about that $3.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just drove around the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't really, they didn't go take
the three bucks and stab somebody for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just skipped paying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of this whole taking medical and
taking it recreational, I went out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: shop the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say which one, but it was for
their special.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, well, you can choose
from the recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was literally four kinds and it was
all sativa heavy, 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, who knows what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I know what shop you went
to and they've recently opened up another
[SPEAKER_02]: location north of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a friend who stopped there just
the other day and they were hopping and
[SPEAKER_02]: the place was full and had all kinds of
great shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they've done is they've taken all
their products from their Pueblo West
[SPEAKER_02]: location.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's full.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, maybe they're marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did a whole shelf of Shatterer,
whole bunch of new extracts and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all kinds of other stuff except for
Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was their special day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was in there like 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shops need to get it together in my
opinion, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that affected us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that affected us here locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That affected me locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medical patients, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why that really sucks is because as a
medical, on the medical side, the herb,
[SPEAKER_02]: is cheaper to just to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even, you know, I'm not going to
lie about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it for not strangling my wife and
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say that on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it for stress relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the medical side, it's a little bit
cheaper to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the recreational side, they charge you
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the recreational side,
they add a tax to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just move the same product from
the recreational side, from the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: side, right over to the recreational side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark it up 10 bucks an eighth more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw the medical patients at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 bucks an eighth more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's half the price more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just mark it up way high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charge an extra tax for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then don't even care about the medical
patients anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can a shop do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can a business owner do that and look
his patients, his customers in the eye?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give you priority over the rec
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means the rec patients can just sit
out there and have red card patients come
[SPEAKER_02]: in, come in, come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got, that's the only thing you
get though, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that red card priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they should take you into the red
card side and take care of you properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pablo, they won't let them open up the,
they already bought the location next to
[SPEAKER_02]: them, had it all worked out with the
owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city came in and says,
hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're doing banging business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, perfect location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, but you're nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Redden and more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 12 of them right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they put a stop to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure to the North, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to let me know, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to dinner tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a 45 minute drive from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the dankest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we please go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to wait in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 11 o'clock in the night right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: For guru crack, I'll go and I'll even
throw in 10 bucks on gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this place in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mate factor in Colorado Springs is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go there and spend money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mate factor in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most amazing veggie wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the veggie wrap with the house
dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cheese sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want something cool, get the veggie
wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want something hot, get that cheese
deluxe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what was in my coffee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I don't drink the coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it was something weird and
fancy and I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jasmine maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: The dark roast Mate is amazing if you're
going to drink something from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a nice coffee from there and it was
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just wrap up the show and we're
going to go to Manitou Springs and eat at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Mate factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good talking to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one more news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is really long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel my throat getting a little itchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do one article and then
really possibly drive to Manitou.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what our friend is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the person that introduced me
to the Monte factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you for that.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's another news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was sent to me by our good
friend, Mike, who is laid out tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike hurt his back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's a big dude to have a hurt back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you were here doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs would help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he couldn't even get in his car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably wouldn't if he hurt his back
because the lung thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he coughs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you like to cough, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys smoke cigarettes and take dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You choke so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to quit that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cigarettes are the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can smoke all the weed we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you smoking cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not your dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So prosecutors object to war on weed is
the title of this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for someone who wrote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the author?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that mine or yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Wigant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was from Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one that Mike sent us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dabbed out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping the show on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prosecutors object to war on weed by Chris
Wigant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably said that wrong, but that's how
I do stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technical glitch there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound like I cut out for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Wigant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prosecution objects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way to put it at any rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two news stories from the Pacific
Northwest today pose an interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are prosecutors beginning to get fed up
with the war on weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: The two stories are completely unrelated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is about a current prosecutor at the
local level and one is about a former
[SPEAKER_02]: federal prosecutor making a noteworthy
endorsement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither has anything to do with the other,
but both show some common sense being
[SPEAKER_02]: applied in refreshing ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too early to call it a trend,
even a regional one, but it certainly is a
[SPEAKER_02]: step in the right direction at the very
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, the local story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle's elected prosecutor said Monday
he's dropping all tickets issued for the
[SPEAKER_02]: public use of marijuana through the first
seven months of this year because most of
[SPEAKER_02]: them were issued by a single officer who
disagrees with the legal pot law.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a briefing to city council on Monday,
city attorney Pete Holmes says he is
[SPEAKER_02]: moving to dismiss approximately 100
tickets issued by the Seattle police
[SPEAKER_02]: department between January 1st and July
30th.
[SPEAKER_02]: His office also said it would be seeking a
refund for 22 people who have already paid
[SPEAKER_02]: their $27 ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one state to the south, a former
federal prosecutor for Oregon has thrown
[SPEAKER_02]: her support behind a ballot initiative to
legalize recreational marijuana for adults
[SPEAKER_02]: in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Olson, who served as Oregon's chief
federal prosecutor during the Clinton
[SPEAKER_02]: administration, made the news by joining
house member Earl Blamenhauer and a former
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon supreme court justice by publicly
supporting the ballot measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enforce our marijuana laws, but they
don't work, Olson said in a statement
[SPEAKER_02]: announcing her endorsement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Filling our courts and jails has failed to
reduce marijuana use and drug cartels are
[SPEAKER_02]: pocketing all the profits, she said,
citing federal statistics that show about
[SPEAKER_02]: one in 14 Oregon arrests is for marijuana
possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick here, you know, we're not,
the government here in Colorado is not
[SPEAKER_02]: bitching about the cartel really any much
anymore running pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're starting to look at like you
guys, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the guys who take care of patients,
they're like, hold on, they're not just,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have control over everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what it's become.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even a crime anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're starting to turn into well,
we're making tons of money, but how can we
[SPEAKER_02]: get just a little more each year,
a little more each year?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no worry of cartels anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old guys around here, a lot of the old
timers don't like to pay kind bud prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get, if you know the right people,
you can get an eighth of dank weed around
[SPEAKER_02]: here for 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, those guys used to buy
that Mexican brick weed for $25 a half
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only smoke a bowl a day, two bowls a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some kind bud would just kill them,
you know, two hits and they'd just be
[SPEAKER_02]: retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lately those guys are calling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the guys I used to talk to years ago,
they're like, hey man, can you get any
[SPEAKER_02]: decent weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they can't find any of their old
swag connects anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that shit is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cartel of Mexican import weed is
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a first story here, and this is
my interjection here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not into the article right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first story here is about a prosecutor
saying that he's going to drop tickets
[SPEAKER_02]: written by a cop because that cop's a dick
and did this out of his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have another person saying the
laws don't work and they state that they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, the drug cartels are profiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like some people are starting
to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are starting to see the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are positive reasons why we want to
legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get back into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first instance, this was nothing
short of a prosecutor using his
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecutorial discretion to avoid wasting
a lot of time in the courts and more
[SPEAKER_02]: importantly to rein in one police officer
who was obviously on a vendetta against
[SPEAKER_02]: the voters for passing a law he did not
personally approve of.
[SPEAKER_02]: One single police officer was responsible
for eight out of all 10 tickets issued in
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle for public consumption of
marijuana during the first half of this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other 20% were written by the entire
rest of the police force.
[SPEAKER_02]: To put this in another way, this officer
on one ticket wrote he considered the new
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization law silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the officer has been reassigned to
new duties, after this came to light,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a lot of folks with cases still
in the legal system as a result of his
[SPEAKER_02]: actions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a dick of a cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cops don't realize what they're doing to
you when they screw you up for having a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of weed or whatever you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them do and they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on guys, if you're a cop,
some cops are listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're a law enforcement officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to educate you about how not
dangerous cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that...
[SPEAKER_02]: Go, just listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inform yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an educated dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to educate people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to keep people safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not bad people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not just hear stoners with words
right there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smokes pot, not a bad person.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Washington state, of course,
recreational marijuana use is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The voters approved the change in state
law and the prosecutor's actions quite
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously reflect the will of the people,
but it didn't have to happen this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prosecutors in general are pretty much
tough on crime types of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this particular prosecutor has
agreed with the cop's way of thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: then all these cases would have continued
to clog the legal system all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: the bitter end, all $27 of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This prosecutor, however, objected to that
scenario and applied some common sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's even going the extra mile and trying
to refund fines already paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is truly commendable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a truly commendable action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, reflecting the will of the
voters in legal reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second news item doesn't seem to deal
with actual legal cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from a prosecutor who no longer
works for the federal department of
[SPEAKER_02]: justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, this is a stunning development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Federal prosecutors, after all,
are not bound by any state law and
[SPEAKER_02]: therefore can apply federal law,
whether marijuana is still the most
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal of all drugs, without even having
to weigh in on state politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, there are some
extremely zealous federal prosecutors all
[SPEAKER_02]: up and down the West Coast who are
fighting tooth and nail against any state
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization efforts in unprecedented and
creative ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hearing even a former prosecutor
bluntly refute the entire purpose of the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal war on weed is a welcome
development indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The language she used is a pretty strong
condemnation of federal laws she upheld
[SPEAKER_02]: while in office.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enforced our marijuana laws and they
don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prosecutors are practical people who deal
with the real end aftermath of arresting
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana users.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the argument used is not a moral one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Locking up marijuana users is wrong or one
of racial equality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black and brown people are treated
differently by the court system or even a
[SPEAKER_02]: political one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The public's mood has shifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it's a view from the front lines
of the drug war, which relies on personal
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and applying federal laws and
the relative effectiveness of carrying out
[SPEAKER_02]: this job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enforced our marijuana laws and they
don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this person, instead of just playing by
the book, basically saying, had weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had weed, go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a lot of weed, go to prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually looking at what they're
doing to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying, they're saying,
you had some weed, you're a human,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's quit smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to prison forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go get butt raped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking some compassion into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just starting to hear the other
side of the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all you, nine times out of 10,
you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're going to court and standing in
front of the judge, everybody just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: pushes you behind your lawyer or public
pretender sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say you have your day,
but a lot of times they just ask you if
[SPEAKER_02]: you understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a yes or no question is all you
really get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good that they're finally starting
to be like, what did you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of all the pro-legalization arguments,
this could perhaps be the strongest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The laws don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the intended effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The feds have been fighting the war on
weed for almost a century now with
[SPEAKER_02]: precious little to show for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, they have severe unintended
consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drug cartels are pocketing all of the
profits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, mindlessly continuing on the
same course is nothing short of madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what they call insanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, free to the prospect of ending their
career over a public statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: many are speaking out on the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their message is a simple one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prohibition didn't work and prohibition of
marijuana isn't working either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Olson is to be commended for raising
her own prosecutorial objection and for
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing her public support behind a ballot
measure in the state where she used to
[SPEAKER_02]: uphold the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: The personal connection to the state
ballot measure might convince a few
[SPEAKER_02]: voters, even tough on crime types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, let me move this page.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all scrolling on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the rest of the arguments aside,
the law needs changing because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does nothing short of waste time for
the entire judicial system for something
[SPEAKER_02]: which shouldn't even be illegal in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon ballot measure race may be
close.
[SPEAKER_02]: A year, Washington and Colorado legalized
recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon had a similar, but badly written
initiative on its ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time around, the effort is a lot more
serious, but reliable polling on the
[SPEAKER_02]: subject is notoriously hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vote might be very close in
November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you're in Oregon, when this comes
up, go vote to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pro-legalization groups will be very
closely watching the vote this year in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon and in Alaska and Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: So assumably, I'm sorry, my throat's
burning out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to go fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Assumably, they'll also be closely
watching the impact of Olson's simple,
[SPEAKER_02]: the laws don't work message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Olson's message is a powerful one because
it could reach voters not generally open
[SPEAKER_02]: to other pro-legalization arguments.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a law and order type of voter,
a former federal prosecutor's opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: should carry some weight, in other words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps more prosecutors, both state and
federal, both current and former,
[SPEAKER_02]: can be enlisted in this movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, it is far too early to call
this any sort of trend, but it certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: is a development worth taking note of.
[SPEAKER_02]: To end on the legal theme we began on,
perhaps the voters will sustain these
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecutors' objections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can follow Chris on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was written by Chris Weigant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very well written article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow him on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me read your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, people are catching on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's glad to see the people are just open
for debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and maybe like they said,
maybe now that the state hasn't melted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The older people don't want to hear from
you and me that weed is harmless,
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis is helpful, that medical
marijuana will help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're a former, if you're a former
from the Fed, then they have to listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: you because you're obviously not full of
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least they should trust you
because you're the one been feeding them
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit for the past, you know,
however many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now what do we believe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we believe all the bullshit that you
told us for many, many years, or do we
[SPEAKER_02]: believe your new bullshit?
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we start believing the new
bullshit from the person that used to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like ex-military, then we're crazy right
along with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just label us as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys heard the air
quotations, but they were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope Oregon gets it going because they
got so much talent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've only seen from social media
and stuff like that, but I've seen people
[SPEAKER_02]: up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right between two Meccas,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be the perfect blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got many respectable people up
there already under medical coma.

[SPEAKER_02]: more time with an intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get right to the interview part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we are back and we're hanging out with the
[SPEAKER_02]: winner of the Secret Cup Mountain
Regional.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our buddy from the Garden of
Weedin'.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Spencer.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just told that there's a Garden of
Weedin' song written by our boy Sloppy and
[SPEAKER_02]: it is freaking sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to our boy Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play your song at the end of
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for permission in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spencer said I can play it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him permission, so it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says Garden of Weedin' in it,
so it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for joining me on the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, it's always fun taking dabs with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hang out a lot and I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Spence is the winner of the Mountain
Region Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might not be familiar with the
Secret Cup, so let's take a little bit to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell them what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Secret Cup is actually a tour,
which they go to different places.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to two places in Cali,
if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's ever been put that
way as a tour because that would be a hell
[SPEAKER_02]: of a marketing way to put some shirts out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how I think of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tour and then there's a
championship in the middle at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they're listening and they get a
marketing idea from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, California, Seattle, here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Michigan, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arizona, Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all the, it's basically a
competition of anywhere from 30 to 40
[SPEAKER_03]: hashmakers all in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A certain amount of product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then each one of the people that enter
are considered judges because we all
[SPEAKER_03]: receive a judge pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go through them and kind of give
everything a score from smell,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, strength, smoothness,
harshness, color, flavor, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each contestant actually gets a 0.3 of
every sample, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get to taste what everybody else's
dab is or what everybody else entered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're the judge, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're the judges.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of a good thing about it
is, you know, it's not being judged by
[SPEAKER_03]: just, you know, random people or like,
you know, just, it's not a, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's technically is a blind judge because
nobody gets to see what, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what everybody's entries are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all just numbered in whatever
numbers or what you vote for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you got your judges kit,
how long did it take you to find your
[SPEAKER_02]: entry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like two minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just had a lot of taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just, you could go through the
entries and kind of just smell and I make
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of get attached, I guess you
could say to like, you know, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: yours and what is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, there was a couple that I was like,
eh, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as soon as you find it,
it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell my flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all choked up actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the secret cup for two days and
took an amazing amount of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then today I went and hung out with
some friends in Denver and my lungs and
[SPEAKER_02]: throat are burnt out from dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got to hydrate if you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: More hydration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence reaches through the water as I say
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all red-eyed and throat dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, everybody got to, I had the honor
of tasting a couple of my friends were
[SPEAKER_02]: judges and entrance contenders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell they were
called.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were judges and they entered and I
got to taste parts of their sample bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some were amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, I don't think I would take a second
dab of a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's definitely, well,
there was 38.
[SPEAKER_03]: Competitors in this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 38.3s you got to go through and you
know, it's kind of tough depending on
[SPEAKER_03]: which kind of, what kind of, like I'm a
wheat snob.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm definitely going to be an oil snob.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, and a lot of it's personal
preference, whether or not you like it
[SPEAKER_03]: this way or you like it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of, that's why it's good that
we're the judges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's at least honest opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to wait a little bit to get into
live resin, but I was worried with you
[SPEAKER_02]: entering live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were going to say it's not
stable because the popular shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: the rage is shattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the live resin is not shattery at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, it looks like it's oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then depending where it's at,
you know, it's, I think somebody said 66
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees is when it actually gets,
it'll shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your house is 66 degrees, you like your
house cold, you'll have shattery live
[SPEAKER_03]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost that in here tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting nice and cool in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperatures are changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this oil is cool right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day you gave me a little sample
of Earl and I didn't even realize that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been dabbing off of the entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been dabbing the winner here for
several days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a second, we'll talk about what's in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The event, we kind of talked about what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that enter are the judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all, everybody gets to taste the
entries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Spence was actually chosen as the
overall champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of the things I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was two location changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, you could probably count three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the venues in Denver got switched
twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to Big D
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big D was smart enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hired a professional event company.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hired the right event services group,
right event groups or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: The right group was in charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They booked and secured a location as they
got there and started to set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were told that they were not allowed
to do the event there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big D is smart enough to where he just
made another phone call and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everybody go to location number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a second spot lined up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that got shut down also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think AJ Hashman made a couple of
phone calls and a couple of emails were
[SPEAKER_02]: sent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lazy lion, sorry about the cough
again, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks to do a podcast with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it sucks to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lazy lion and the speakeasy vape
lounge volunteered to let the secret cup
[SPEAKER_02]: come have their party there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already had ship booked for that
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: They canceled it and they came and they
let us come and have a huge party there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Big D, AJ Hashman and
everybody involved with the speakeasy and
[SPEAKER_02]: the lazy lion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the vendors packed right on up
and came with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the booths were full.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the artists came.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturday was a little, a little kind of
bare, but Sunday was pretty crowded in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got crowded just depending on what time
of the day it was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The speakeasy was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to get into the speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lazy lion was actually the VIP lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't have my VIP badge so I
couldn't go in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lazy lion is, it's, they by far have
the headiest glass collection I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: ever.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Joe Peters queen bee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a huge, like I think I saw the
picture that Maddie posted of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Maddie, who was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Maddie?
[SPEAKER_03]: That piece is like 80k.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 80k.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to hit it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half the rigs are just for display.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see a bong with a goldfish swimming
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's labeled not to smoke out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, please don't smoke out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a bong with a big base and it's a
beta fish actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said goldfish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beta.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty novel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised no one's thought of that
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a shout out to the places and people
that made that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about your entry now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your entry was live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to tell the people what strain
it was or are you kind of- Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's already out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Sinz OG from Sin City Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mixed with Scotts OG from Rare
Dankness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Classy mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sinz OG was a kosher kush dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fino, I guess you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys need to know about phenotypes,
go back a few episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a real- Scotts OG was just an
awesome OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely lanky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not super tall, but it was taller than I
would usually like plants to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But super fuely and heavy indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just awesome resin production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a pretty decent yielder too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one I mixed with the Sinz,
which was a kosher dominant, which the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinz OG is blue power and kosher kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a kosher kush dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just had a way better kosher,
like burnt rubber, ishy smell,
[SPEAKER_03]: which comes out in hash as an OG smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a real, it's got a fuely funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: This hash definitely has a fuely funk to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a lot of sativas because like you
said, I'm a sativa breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a lot of the sativa or a lot of
sativa in this indica kind of dominance in
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really sits me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes my eyes droopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really nice cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's got the citrusy spice to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's adding that?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like sort of a spice to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost got a lemony citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes from the Scotts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a little bit of lemon OG,
like that OG pine-ness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes the pine can transfer over
to like a citrusy lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a good strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pheno hunt out of, I ran a pack
and I kept three or four of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was three or four of them in the
room and I got to pick which ones I wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to make the entry with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool being able to actually
go in and pick what flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the people who won were like,
thanks to this person for letting me get
[SPEAKER_03]: the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool for us because I don't have to
ask anybody for product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all comes from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: All in-house is great too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good to know, I've seen your
guys' garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to know that it's a clean safe
garden where my medicine comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of my extracts comes straight
from you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of picky about where I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are the first people I go to
when I need medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you, when you're looking in the
room, what makes you say that strain and
[SPEAKER_02]: that strain right there or that plant and
that plant right there are going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: award-winning?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's more of just, you kind of
literally go plant to plant and just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't do it in a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of takes a week or two as they're
finishing to be able to tell which flavors
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to come through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I don't even think I was going to
do, I made another batch, the green ribbon
[SPEAKER_03]: batch, but the green ribbon just didn't
carry the same like when you feel some
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, you know how they're like,
some plants are like super sticky where
[SPEAKER_03]: you touch them and then your fingers are
stuck together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some you touch and you get
like the stringiness, resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some you touch where it's
like just wet, where you don't even,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like slick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just kind of go and look for
different, you know, for me, it's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: about flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to, you know- Your hash is
always flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bunch of your shatter with me at
the secret cup and everybody I would dab
[SPEAKER_02]: out would go, Ooh, that's tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of golden goat that you made and
some cookies that you made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some cookies you did a while
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it on secret stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, shout out to Vigorlover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Vigorlover for the gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edit it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow he got to me some solventless hash
that tastes pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have to edit some of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I can leave in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This works mids though, so it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag team mids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor guy cannot get away from that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk a lot about live resin on this
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody tells me that I've always got
great hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: They compliment it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to say, I don't make hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot about making hash because
little Kev bro is my buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're my buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet tells you all about making
dabs if you want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to be educated, but I don't make
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying my best to describe live
resin to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have asked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you exhale that fucking monstrous
dab, I owe a dollar for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a dollar every time I say the F word
on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after you do, will you teach me and
our listeners a little lesson about what
[SPEAKER_02]: live resin is and how it's done?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody's heard of fresh frozen
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically where you harvest your plant,
you essentially freeze it or flash freeze
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for ice hash, you wash it in your
bags or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now instead of, as far as opening the
last thing, I know people who do it live
[SPEAKER_03]: resin, but I think it's once the closed
closed loop game came out and we figured
[SPEAKER_03]: out you could do that same process in a
closed loop at a bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It completely changes hash for the better,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it's fresh frozen closed loop
BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: If done proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, I'm going to go a little
slower on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taken plants that are ready for
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop them down, freeze them in the deep
freeze, and then put them in a closed loop
[SPEAKER_02]: butane extraction system, which we'll talk
more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Kevin and I have talked about
that, but there's open blasting and closed
[SPEAKER_02]: loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence uses a closed loop method and blast
the fresh frozen like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need to be vacuum purged after
that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, once it comes through your system,
it's really, you know, it takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the butane out before you even get to
touch the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using that closed loop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the closed loop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it pumps it out because it takes all
the liquid back out, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so then you're left with just your
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as, you know, flavors, I really
think it keeps a better turf profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It honestly, if you can, all right,
so this is going to be kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand, but it tastes like it smells
when it's growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can understand what, you know,
when you touch a plant and you smell your
[SPEAKER_03]: fingers, that crazy smell you get that it
doesn't ever smell like that once it's
[SPEAKER_03]: dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you, when you're stripping or
making hash from a fresh product,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get that fresh flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if your bud was a fruit and you
took a bite out of that fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what this hash tastes like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the turpinoid and that's the turf
profile in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just, everyone's new word now
is turps, turps, turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just feel like an asshole every time
I say turps, but the turps in that is
[SPEAKER_02]: turpy slurpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a big, it's like a bite of
candy every time you hit a dab of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally is like, it could be dessert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody needs to make some jilly bean
live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's crazy like, all right,
so blueberry sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of strings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made cookies live.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got across some tangy and some grateful
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the tangerine dog, the look on your
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangerine dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been writing down strain names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you have neat strain names,
you can feel free to tweet those to me at
[SPEAKER_02]: iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might use one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I use your strain name, I might send
you a pack of it when I make it,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I remember and if I can find your
tweet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so live resin is basically,
you know, a more fresh frozen VHL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I think it's a more flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you vacuum purging it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what I was asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, vacuum purge it after,
you know, everything I do goes into an
[SPEAKER_03]: oven after, you know, you extract it from
your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because your system takes pretty much a
good majority of it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but you still got to go through your
vacuum process to, you know, keep cleaning
[SPEAKER_03]: and removing certain gases and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know, do you do anything special to
your plants or flowers if you know you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make oil out of them for live
resin?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have done like, what was it,
48 hours of dark before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I really think with as far as
live, it's all about the product you put
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the better, you know,
the flowers that are going in,
[SPEAKER_03]: the better the oil is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no trim run in this room, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: No trim run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, like from my trim, like my
personal stuff, I still open blast it and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, I think it comes out
better than the closed loop, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: People need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're snobs over here and I'll stick
with this Nug Run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Nug Run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can almost tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can almost tell, even smoke and shatter,
I can tell the difference in Nug and Earl,
[SPEAKER_02]: Nug Run and trim run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can taste, once you start smoking
live, you can taste the difference between
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's in a closed loop and if it's not
in a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel super spoiled now that I smoke so
much live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I just, I find myself hiding my
live, like just the live resins over here
[SPEAKER_02]: and the rest of my shatter is over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can smoke this shatter all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The live resin, I'll bark at you like a
dog if you get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit more about the Secret Cup
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you're a freaking champion now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a Secret Cup winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it sunk in yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's funny is about this is I went
to, what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Secret Cup last year when they had it in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went with a couple of buddies of mine
and that was like right when I was really
[SPEAKER_03]: first getting into really making like oil,
like more than just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: every now and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember telling everybody,
I was like, dude, we're going to enter
[SPEAKER_03]: this cup next year and we're going to win
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, a year later we
fucking, oh snap, my bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying not to say fuck so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, every time I say it,
I owe a dollar to a charity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of not that I'm bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said we were going to win it and we
came out and, you know, brought,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we came real proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a lot of the differences between,
I think, us, which I don't speak for
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't, you know, I don't know
everybody that competed, but like we
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have to source our product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to actually go pick it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that made a difference as far
as flavor, being able to pick certain
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors and knowing what you want and
hash, you know, it was just easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, I would have hated to have to go
source, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just find something that's good enough to
make.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a guy that comes straight
to me for his Secret Cup material and
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, he's always like, bro, I need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need this crop at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you understand how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all about quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I grow weed first before I make
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's, it's a lot different
when you spend 10 weeks with a plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: then make hash instead of buying it off
the shelf and making hash with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's a lot more full circle,
which is important to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, as we say, it's grown by us,
processed by us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed to live resin to a cup.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't really, I don't know if it's
sink in because I wasn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly, I went in with thinking I was
going to have a top three finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how I'm just competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate losing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was cool being able to go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost thought I lost once they did all
the awards and then third second,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh no, we didn't win.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did, they did like highest CBD they
did best turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did crowd choice or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Connoisseur's choice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Connoisseur's choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they do third, second,
and then big D said, so first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said something to the equivalent of
you guys already know who it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, then it's probably
somebody that's already gotten an award is
[SPEAKER_02]: what I assumed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then he said garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as he said garden,
I think I peed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went through and did second place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the bubble, which the bubble
was fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it that, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know it was bubble that won.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the second place solvent list
bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I looked at Matty and I was like,
we might not win.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like he did the announcement,
whatever, and it was tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish I would have, I wasn't thinking
I was going to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like my speech was super like short and
to the point, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, well, it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said something about where you're
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great to be here with all these
people making hash and celebrating and
[SPEAKER_02]: winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't know you were going to win?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't know I was going to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was going to win, but it just
came through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we really just put in everything
we had into the competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it paid off for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any other samples that stood
out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was kind bails.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, you know, shout out to kind of bill
for, you know, coming up with the live
[SPEAKER_03]: resin tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that who made that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of bill who won third is actually the
dude who came up with live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you beat that guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: When he was talking in his speech,
he was like, there's some, there's some
[SPEAKER_03]: guys out here doing, you know,
my same technique that are killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to say he was regarding me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, his is, his was on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sour D deep chunk and gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was just, it was really
good, but it was just too complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like straight to the,
not straight to the point, but just
[SPEAKER_03]: there's like the glue and the sour almost
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the deep chunk is, I think a sour
diesel deep chunk or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a purple each drain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if he would have done the sour D
and the glue, it would have been a whole,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would have came out a whole lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, I think the flavors would
have pulled through just that sour with a,
[SPEAKER_03]: what was it saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla glue is gorilla glue is basically
a old school sour or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gorilla glue was a ridiculous plant,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one grown right now and you got
to tie it down and it will break the tie
[SPEAKER_02]: downs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, I literally had one that
had, I think it started with three tops
[SPEAKER_03]: and I literally just, as it would grow,
we're just super crop each top down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now it has like 18 tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to have a 10 gallon gorilla glue
that has 25 stakes in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to take a plant out of
the room or something because these two
[SPEAKER_02]: gorilla glues are taking more space than I
completely predicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read who made it the other day on the
forum.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I read the cross too, and I'm not
surprised that it's so killer now that I
[SPEAKER_03]: read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what made me think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to talk for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, but yeah, I'll give another shout
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, thanks to big D, um, Jeremy Norrie
from rigg rags, um, coming out from Cali,
[SPEAKER_03]: coming to support the Colorado movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, everybody who made the drive from
Denver to the Springs to go dab,
[SPEAKER_03]: like that is so true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not a lot of people, you know,
can say, Hey, let's go drive an hour down
[SPEAKER_03]: the street or down this beautiful damn
state we live in and go dab with every,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of our friends, even, even the people
we don't know that we're all, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody's, the best thing about our type of
events is there's no rowdiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no drunk people around getting mad
and trying to fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just people high and
kicking it, which is right down my alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too much expensive glass around to
get rowdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people don't want to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to pay for a $10,000
mothership rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that you won or actually the
award started in the, uh, the PA system
[SPEAKER_02]: was kind of shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody could hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody just moved right up to the
front.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a rig, a Toro rig sitting on a
table, a rig, a torch, and a little piece
[SPEAKER_02]: of shatter just sitting on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You left that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all walked away, left it sitting on the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it there an hour later,
just sitting there chilling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody touched it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all the shatter was still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfectly intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to know, you know, you don't
have to worry about things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good community for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, dude, you got a big old box of prizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a torch with, uh, like a cup,
like a cannabis cup looking thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a vector torch that has like
a cup trophy on it that has a gold dragon
[SPEAKER_03]: wrapped around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says like, first place and it says
secret cup on the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then inside that cup, it's filled with
like, I don't know, it looks like live.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll call it live.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's filled up with just, you know,
it looks like a bunch of oil, which it was
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I got the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a rig from monsters glass company.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if I correct me, if I'm wrong,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's a sick rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has like a little puppet flip disc in
the bottom, which it came with like a
[SPEAKER_03]: matching pendant, which the pin is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dope pendant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, matching dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did we get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was a box of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you had big Mike with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Mike was toting that box around like a
toy box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what was in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a new email in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got that from, it wasn't in the box,
but that was a part of the prize and the
[SPEAKER_03]: email rocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whoever made, made the shout out to you
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it, my other email is going to be in
the corner getting dusty now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So got a pretty sweet, uh, grassroots hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that prize box was huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was, you know, so, so much
worth, you know, giving up, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 grams alive, which is, you know,
I could keep that and smoke that for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, it comes back worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, you get to spend two
days with, you know, an awesome community
[SPEAKER_03]: with Maddie around, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like 20 days worth of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: My lady smokes so much oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy, but she has a, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like she dabs, but she doesn't get,
she gets high, but then she'll like take
[SPEAKER_03]: another dab and get on high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she wants to take another dab
because she's think she's on high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now she's high again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: She can smoke all the oil she wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, Maddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That prize box was sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so now you get to go to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, is that the semi-finals or the finals?
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegas is the finals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the top three from every place on
the tour in Denver or in Vegas,
[SPEAKER_03]: my bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to usually don't go to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think, I think when I was,
that's how popular we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you got to be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were talking about Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to think about going to
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we were looking into houses and
they today in Vegas, like every house is
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just like, it's not Pueblo where
there's only one street that has nice
[SPEAKER_03]: houses on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we, uh, so we're looking into like
getting a house for like a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I guess, I don't know how long
everybody's going to be there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if we're going to get it, we'll get it
for a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sleeps like 10 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have, every house has a pool and
backyards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll just go to, I'm not going to,
I might party like one or two nights,
[SPEAKER_03]: but otherwise I'm just going to kick it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll lose too much money in Vegas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegas is expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's where you can get a house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a six bedroom house for a week for
like 900 bucks for the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's like 75 bucks a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Gucci with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, we can afford that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Vegas is it's in December and not a
hundred percent on the dates, but
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere in December.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the weed laws like in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some stuff we're going to have to
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look like we need to get pulled over if
we're in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a Vegas jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just fly there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm flying there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go, I'm not driving to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to drive through Utah or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still New Mexico, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, just get on a plane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an hour later, you're in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I guess we're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maddie, we're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, get your tickets now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I got dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be gone for less time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you fly, you don't have to waste all
that 14 hours worth of driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got all kinds of homies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take care of your dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, all my homies want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need somebody to take care of Siroc and
Nana.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's in December.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's top three from every, you know,
spot on the tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's such a good tour, the secret cut
tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, so it's a competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the winner of that one is the champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets the gold WWF looking belt,
WCW, whatever they are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care, but I want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pro wrestling looking belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many winners have there been before?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there was Mortimer won last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mortimer says she won finals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Skipton was one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there another year?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's only been like, it ain't been
that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shout out to the previous winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Mortimer says that the, uh,
the event was gorgeous as always.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else have you won, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you've been talking about this thing
you do on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so Thursdays in Denver at the seven 10
hat pin social lounge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Off of Colfax Thursday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a top shelf Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, right now we're in the process of
a 16 person extract tournament basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's bracketed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I won my quarter finals on Thursday
before the secret cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm now into the, I'm one of four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you enter the same material?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, I did, uh, the Cindy Lapew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing it with different shit even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Cindy Lapew times freedom baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just awesome floral, just goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then I did that green ribbon,
live sugar, butter, whatever people want
[SPEAKER_03]: to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it sugar because it's not like a
butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Butter's like wet and pasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does look, it almost looks like a
bubble hash all month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm into the semis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's two more rounds into the finals
or in, uh, to make the other side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bracket.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, I think it's me and kind bill
kind bills in and me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's like four other people
that are fighting for the last two spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've won two of those and then won the
secret cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won the super bud bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won nothing like second in the super bud
bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, have you participated in any,
in any of those closet growers cup events?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I always missed the, well,
it sucks cause a lot of my stuff I grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's not timed perfectly to where I
can take stuff out of my garden,
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually don't enter, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is now I've got 10 weeks to get all
the flavors I want to do for the cup ready
[SPEAKER_03]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just enough time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's perfect because I have just the
right amount of plants that are just big
[SPEAKER_03]: enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're outgrowing their threes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're ready to go into probably like
tens or so and just finish from now to
[SPEAKER_03]: then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be able to pick what I want when
I want it and which flavors we want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoked to see what you enter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the privilege.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence calls me up and he's like,
bro, I just ran like seven batches alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need your expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to enter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go over there and they heat up the email
and Maddie passes me dabs and they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just watch my reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was definitely a good experience
being able to, you know, win something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's good for, you know, I'm not from
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like I called my parents,
like, yo, I just won this hash competition
[SPEAKER_03]: mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my mom's like, well, what does that
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good to know that my, like I'm
actually, you know, progressing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, getting further into the scene,
I guess the weed scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool being able to know that out
of what?
[SPEAKER_03]: 38 people from Colorado or came to
Colorado to enter hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the best hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not just 38 random people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it's invite only.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get like the secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like kumatay of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kumatay hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get an invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a private party.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Private party.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's, what's next for the,
the garden of Whedon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than Vegas, other than crushing Las
Vegas and taking home the belt and
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing it to Pueblo, Colorado to get it
all dusty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna have to get like a fake one,
a dummy belt to wear around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking to some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot of people that I met,
you know, traveling, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: different networking stuff this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to, we might be traveling
to a couple of different places to let
[SPEAKER_03]: people experience live and kind of,
you know, get people to show that,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's another form of hash on,
on the map that is take this to the other
[SPEAKER_02]: legal States show them what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a couple of people that I
talked to, you know, through social media
[SPEAKER_03]: and just networking that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hopefully if it works out,
it would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, who knows, you know, we're kind
of just doing our thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really, you know, especially here
in Colorado, it's such a legal scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to, you know, you've got to have
money to, you know, get a license and go
[SPEAKER_03]: that route and have a building,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just the guy that lives in this,
you know, and it just grows really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We makes good hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, one day there'll be,
you know, a business or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now we're just, you know,
we just like to grow pot and live in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better than living anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a great way to wrap up this
little interview with the champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm calling you the champion
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the champ in my mind, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to win that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got faith in you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, dude, thanks for coming to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anybody you want to give any shout
outs to or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see.

[SPEAKER_03]: Um, floppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nonnie Siroc, Harvey Bain, uh,
Indica, big Mike who's not here and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: hates his life right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, fall broke his iPhone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say on the phone, we kind of
talked about that, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Broke his brand new phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just got a week ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's really about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to everybody that supports our
genetics garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We you know, anybody that's doing
something, you know, positive shout out to
[SPEAKER_03]: y 'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to everybody that's growing
their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what else are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Gardner weeding is going to be sponsoring
an epilepsy fundraiser in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: End of November, I think, um, is when it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'll try to get some more
information about that, which it'll be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it'll be our first time actually
going to an event like this and kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, being out in a more,
not necessarily hippie crowd, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just kind of being more in the
medical side of the dad, kids,
[SPEAKER_03]: medical, get off the couch and stop diving
and kind of go, you know, hang out with
[SPEAKER_03]: these kids that, you know, this,
this stuff saves their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a kid, um, you've heard of
the, uh, was it team landing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I actually got to meet, uh,
a buddy of mine who makes all the oil for
[SPEAKER_03]: him, all the CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, his oil tested, what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 40s, 40% CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he knows that the little kid will be
like, Hey, or Landon will be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey mommy, I need my cannabis and make me
feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, which, you know, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go out there and
support, you know, the other side of being
[SPEAKER_03]: free in the cannabis industry,
you know, just being able to go actually
[SPEAKER_03]: help people, which is, you know,
cool for us giving back to people who need
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to pay it forward for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medical is what started this for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't forget them.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, the, if it wasn't for the people who
need it for medical reasons, the people
[SPEAKER_03]: who don't need it for medical reasons
wouldn't be smoking it legally,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bro.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be right about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He handed me the keys to the shop and he
said, here, you have a dispensary and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I miss the good old days,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: From that day, I pretty much had a
dispensary and we rocked that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had days over $10,000 in sales in one
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of it as the time I had the best
job ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Wild Wild West.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids coming in with quarter pounds and
backpacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boss handing you three edibles at the
beginning of your shift and asking how
[SPEAKER_01]: they tasted four minutes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to elaborate on both of those
topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would be at work just serving
customers, cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have reggae playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have my laptop on the desk playing
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a vaporizer set up at the Bud Bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be fair, we usually smoke joints
upstairs away from the customer service
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, I was reckless and just
smoking joints because there were no
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as everybody had a medical
marijuana card, we could be smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana so there weren't any
things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all in there smoking and customers
are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would show up and be like,
hey, do you want to check out this sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel that I grew?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, I sure do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they'd offer it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it to you for this much a
quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, look, you see what we sell at
Four and Eight, so you got to give me a
[SPEAKER_02]: deal on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'd get a good price together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd start selling that person's quarter
pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike would be able to grow a quarter pound
and bring it into work and put it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf and get paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every employee had something on this shelf
that they had arranged and had a little
[SPEAKER_01]: profit cut of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember mine was little infused
candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, of course, had herb on the shelf that I
was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of white rhino and cherry widow was
coming from my gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take my quarter pound that I grew
in my basement and take that to work,
[SPEAKER_02]: sell it to the boss essentially for a
specified price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then get an hourly rate to stand there and
sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To push my product that I just grew so
that it'll sell out sooner so that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: bring another quarter pound back to work
tomorrow and make a little more bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boss would come to you at the end of
the day and be like, great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want more of that from you,
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the benefits of having that job was
I got to see a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one day off every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made sure to give me ... After a
while, we hired more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got two days off a week, but I had one
day off a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would spend that one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would drive to another city and not be
the dispensary employee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go in as a customer to as many
shops as I could and just go do recon work
[SPEAKER_02]: at all these dispensaries and see what
they had to offer and see how their shops
[SPEAKER_02]: are set up, see who's working there,
see what the bud tenders know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm doing something, I want to be
really good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always go, well, let's see what the best
looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go try to see what I want to do and
also learn what I do not want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a lot of ways to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was so much shit available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some shops that you can smell
that musty hay, improperly cured and dried
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis smell in the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I just want to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already tell that this is going to
be B grade product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my feet wet of growing commercial
cannabis in one of those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: How challenging is it to go from being an
outdoor grower to being like, I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: call you a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an indoor, they call us basement
growers is what we're labeled as.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a derogatory term.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of is, but if you've got the right
basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that you can't be a really
awesome, sexy basement grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that it's still sort of a dig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like caregiver, private caregiver,
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how were your changes going from being
a caregiver in a residential grow to
[SPEAKER_02]: having a gigantic commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say on a commercial grow,
you're not growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're managing a schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of a plant management,
no fund intended, but you're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep all the wheels greased and rolling
and functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you start into a grow that didn't
have that mindset to begin with,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's quite disastrous.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you had to come in and kind of take
over for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to learn that from, I have no
college education.
[SPEAKER_02]: You learned that the hard way in the
middle of it, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trial by fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sink or swim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I got to give you credit because
the shop that you were thrown into,
[SPEAKER_02]: they did not provide the proper equipment
supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually there was one before that,
but yeah, no, that one was a joke too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you learn a lot from having to deal
with the joke at least?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, tremendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning what not to do is just as
beneficial as learning what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it helps to figure out why you
do it that way by seeing what happens when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's done wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people can only learn that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked for a few of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to stand back and let it
crash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a completely amateur mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other night I've got a gorilla glue
plant and it's growing out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sort of, it's kind of mainlining,
but not really because I'm not cleaning
[SPEAKER_02]: everything off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to pull it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I split that bitch right down the middle,
trying to pull one side too far from the
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: One piece of duct tape and a twisty dye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little clone gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I thought about it, but I just
thought, I panicked and was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just wrap this up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just quick first aid, split it and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's happy four or five days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks stronger there than she did
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they made a super new mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had something to go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was just going to say there was a
reason they called it weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows like a damn weed if you do it
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to all those dispensaries through,
I've been to shops from Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Springs, Denver, East and West of
Denver, both directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten up to Boulder or Fort
Collins to the dispensaries, but it seems
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, no shops in Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was up at a couple in Fort Collins
before they got killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time back in the bad old days
again, but they were about like you'd see
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are good and bad examples and the
good examples range the spectrum from very
[SPEAKER_01]: culturey to very medical officey and sort
of the bad ones, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the huge regulation has
changed the quality and product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it hurt and helped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the incredible growers couldn't
handle the regulation when it first came
[SPEAKER_01]: down and then quality dropped and it
stayed kind of down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to bash it too bad,
but quality dipped for a while when the
[SPEAKER_01]: best growers were all forced out of the
legal industry and it took a while for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were great at business and
great at following regulations to catch up
[SPEAKER_01]: with making a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were industry leaders for a while
and I think now solid product is more
[SPEAKER_01]: common than shady product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I'm not up at the shops as
often as I'd like to be to say this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: with more confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that kind of annoys me,
we made all these regulations to prevent
[SPEAKER_02]: shitty weed, pesticides, mildews,
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't go inspect the bud at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just pay attention to the dollars and
the sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about the products or the
safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: They check on the edibles and make sure
the edibles are the proper dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, they don't really
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a regulatory system for safety
inspections for smokeables other than
[SPEAKER_01]: through tobacco and Colorado didn't really
have that infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the food stuff, kitchen safety and
all of those rules are already in place
[SPEAKER_01]: and we saw what happened when those first
inspections came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody at the table kind of smiled and
looked at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry AJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say they've just
recently started enforcing these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw AJ at the Secret Cup over the
weekend and it's good to see him smiling
[SPEAKER_02]: back on his feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: His little Yoda rig is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up AJ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: AJ Hashman, shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a hundred people got dinged and it's
not like they were doing anything that bad
[SPEAKER_01]: or that wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just their first taste of what the
high-end food quality regulations really
[SPEAKER_01]: looked like in a medical edible production
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even Dixie got hit and they're the
ones that are like the shining example in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the regulations come down, the people
that were great at following them have to
[SPEAKER_01]: step up and figure out how to be great at
growing weed too because they haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: practicing for 20 years because they were
terrified of breaking the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're good at following them
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you can't find my product on
the shelf because they changed all those
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I think when it was all the basement
growers and the caregivers doing it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got expensive too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it did because all the cameras,
all the regulations, all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_02]: super expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big expense to start off is the
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like unless you can find a landlord
willing to give Uncle Sam his property to
[SPEAKER_01]: let you live your dream, which thanks dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that you ain't finding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to buy the property yourself
and unless you've got a million dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not owning a retail property in
Colorado sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anywhere other people live anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah well I know several people that are
on the look for property.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always that hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise his hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: From a grower's standpoint too most
business or most dispensary owners are
[SPEAKER_04]: more at this day and age are more of a
business minded person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you said know nothing about
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can be incredibly hard to work
with from a grower's point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I wish I would have learned,
I wish I would have gone to business
[SPEAKER_02]: school instead of learning to be a super
good pot grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to business school.
[SPEAKER_01]: These regulations are confusing as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it ain't the lack of schooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're better at business than most
of the people that I went to DU business
[SPEAKER_01]: school with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you dropped out of society and went on
tour while they went to college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't have a lot to do with how
well you did in business school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the life experience was priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now following the regulations is
really a question of are you willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay your lawyer?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have that capital to have that
lawyer because the weed lawyers are
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know it is from my perception kind
of from the outside because I really don't
[SPEAKER_01]: do a lot of shop shopping or not as much
as I'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the really successful shops that have
a handful of locations a reputation for
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing consistent product are the ones
that really invested in a good grower and
[SPEAKER_01]: setting up a grow that that grower can
really run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And paid the shit out of that lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kept him happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many shops died because the grower and
the business people got in a pissing
[SPEAKER_01]: contest and rather than succeed they just
peed on each other a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most popular dispensaries in
the state does not have their super
[SPEAKER_02]: popular grower and grow team anymore
because of recent political changes they
[SPEAKER_02]: chose to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't call out any names but yeah that
was a terrible breakup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of sad to see that but it did
make for some great new opportunities.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Onward and upward.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of onward and upward my mic
sounds all echoey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys hear that in the headphones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I echoey to you too?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that fix it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay it's because I got your mic turned up
real hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning how to work sound equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only took me 34 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right I may edit part of that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason that Mike actually Mike and
Jesse have been contacting me talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: me about this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This I was sleeping on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike thankfully is a super active member
of our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes to city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: He supports cannabis any way that he can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse works at a hydro shop and try and is
also a farmer a grower and tries to do
[SPEAKER_02]: what he can to stay up on politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pay attention to the local news to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just pay attention to the world and
national cannabis news and the state news.
[SPEAKER_02]: So luckily Mike brought this to my
attention and Jesse had some stuff to add
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put these guys in touch and then they
were like we got to get on the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was their idea to do a show about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for giving me material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I don't know what should I just start
telling the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of took some notes and I've got a
little opening an opening statement if you
[SPEAKER_02]: will.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says states let me try that again
without a frog in my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says city staff is attempting to draft
a new ordinance that would ban all indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make the rules that say they
want to make rules that say we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in a separate building detached from
our house and that is bullshit because of
[SPEAKER_02]: many reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that pretty accurate what I wrote
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just indoor home growing though all
home growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no greenhouse in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: No just out in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: No in your basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: No in your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: No little grow cabinet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means everything at your local hydro
store is pretty much pointless because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't use any of it unless you build a
special outbuilding just for your six
[SPEAKER_01]: personal cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of us can afford to build a
special outbuilding just for our cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have six of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hot topic in the chieftain the last
couple of weeks has been revolving around
[SPEAKER_01]: most people in this well not most people
in the city several people in the city not
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to afford trash service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electricity payments things like this and
we're talking about having people build a
[SPEAKER_01]: special airtight smellproof building so
they can grow six pot plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well technically three because you're only
allowed three in bloom at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd only have three stinky flowering
plants in that building ever at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would also affect caregivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's using a 64 as reference but it would
also affect caregivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would just be six plants outside so
you can't do it isn't that gonna make it
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to steal harder to take care of
it's gonna be another building you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have to get a building permit you're
gonna need to wire that building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well everybody in the neighborhood would
know that that's why the six people on the
[SPEAKER_01]: block or in the neighborhood or whatever
just built that special new building
[SPEAKER_01]: behind their house.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have to own your said property.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first place my mind went is it's a
huge kick to Black Hills because everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's been using a greenhouse or following
the very letter of the law and just chain
[SPEAKER_01]: linking their plants into a cage and
essentially growing them purely outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: in their backyard but in an enclosed
locked space now you've got to put them
[SPEAKER_01]: under expensive grow lights with fancy you
know air filtration equipment and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just a huge gift to Black Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you said that you had an idea of why
this ordinance was being drafted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple weeks ago and I'm the City
Council policy nerd I go attend just about
[SPEAKER_01]: every meeting I was there two weeks ago
listening to the interviews for the new
[SPEAKER_01]: City Council seat and then for the
budgetary meeting they had after that and
[SPEAKER_01]: during the budgetary meeting just sort of
offhandedly a couple of the council
[SPEAKER_01]: members referenced a complaint they had
all received the previous week from a
[SPEAKER_01]: homeowner on the south side who's an
elderly gentleman and wakes up every day
[SPEAKER_01]: to the stink of marijuana plants and now
everybody sitting at this table is like
[SPEAKER_01]: you asked why'd you say stink well it's
because that's how this old guy sees it
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how what he called City Council
about and being City Council and not
[SPEAKER_01]: having a whole lot to do other than please
your constituents and you know respond to
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like this a number of them drove out
to this guy's house and gave it a smell
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sandy Daff said it was a very strong
from the driveway she pulled up into this
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman's house so next she pulls up
next door and she can smell this guy's
[SPEAKER_01]: garden Steve Narake said that he didn't
really smell it but when he was standing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the backyard he could clearly see
several plants over the top of a privacy
[SPEAKER_01]: fence so you know it gives you an idea how
big this caregiver was doing in his
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard and it doesn't sound like he's
meeting all of the basic city code stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: because they weren't enclosed or locked
they were just in his backyard but the
[SPEAKER_01]: cops have been out at this guy's house his
neighbors are pissed like would any of you
[SPEAKER_01]: ever stink out your neighbors like this
it's a pretty easy way to bring problems
[SPEAKER_01]: on yourself like it's I would be
embarrassed if my neighbors smelled me
[SPEAKER_02]: every morning as an indoor grower I try to
be really covert my neighbors I'm certain
[SPEAKER_02]: my neighbors know what I do because
they've seen me carrying things they see
[SPEAKER_02]: my dreadlocks they know who I am they've
seen my Facebook they probably listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: the podcast one of my neighbors one of my
neighbors was a vendor I don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: he sold exactly but he brought me a large
box of lighters fresh lighters like he's
[SPEAKER_02]: like this I'm pretty sure you guys smoke
you want some lighters and that big
[SPEAKER_02]: gigantic box over there is that's all
lighters dude I'm serious so my neighbors
[SPEAKER_02]: know what's up but I still I don't I try
to keep it on they're not calling City
[SPEAKER_01]: Council on you saying you're a bad
neighbor because they don't wake up like I
[SPEAKER_01]: would be mortified like clearly my mother
did not raise whoever's growing these pot
[SPEAKER_01]: plants but you know so City Council went
out there and during the meeting the other
[SPEAKER_01]: night they mentioned sort of offhandedly
that they had all received this complaint
[SPEAKER_01]: and they all agreed that this guy should
be able to wake up in the morning and not
[SPEAKER_01]: smell his neighbor's pot plants and they
didn't really say anything else about it
[SPEAKER_01]: they kind of chuckled about the smell and
contact high got thrown around a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and they went on to they were busy
they were going over budgetary stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: the city's millions of dollars in the hole
so it got dropped pretty quick and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know being who I am and doing what I do
all day when I read the article in the
[SPEAKER_01]: chieftain today I called every City
Council member in Pueblo and three of them
[SPEAKER_01]: called me back today and discussed this
issue and all of them said that this isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they asked for or that
they're aware that any other council
[SPEAKER_01]: person asked for rather it's something the
city staff has put together based on those
[SPEAKER_01]: offhanded comments it the council meeting
the other night so this is all the
[SPEAKER_01]: brainchild of somebody in planning and
zoning who's attempting to please his
[SPEAKER_01]: bosses who might not or whom he decided
might want to weed can't smell weed in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo type ordinance the City Council
people I talked to all use the word
[SPEAKER_01]: unenforceable or all agreed that any sort
of ordinance that covered growing pot in a
[SPEAKER_01]: basement or in a garage like all of that
is unenforceable they can't send somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: to every house in Pueblo and check so
essentially if you're not being a jerk and
[SPEAKER_01]: stinking up your neighbor to begin with
there'd be no way for them to find you
[SPEAKER_01]: making this totally pointless so I don't
see it really going anywhere but
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless everybody who gives a shit
needs to show up on the 13th at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: at the city council building down on Union
and grand you're the city council guy you
[SPEAKER_02]: should be telling me don't look at me with
a question I drive I drive there without
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking at this point yeah I'm pretty
sure I will tweet the correct address Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: is saying guys we want to go on October
13th to City Council and tell them that
[SPEAKER_02]: this proposed idea is unacceptable and
that it will not work for us while you
[SPEAKER_02]: were talking I came up with an alternative
a cannabis courtesy law it's like a don't
[SPEAKER_02]: ask don't tell but if we can smell it you
got to turn it down that's a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: courtesy I'd like to see more of a public
service announcement that's like don't be
[SPEAKER_02]: a fucking asshole you can say you can say
that I'm not charging you the dollar but
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's it's a common courtesy thing I
would be mortified is the word I would use
[SPEAKER_01]: to describe it not embarrassed not ashamed
fucking mortified if my neighbor smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: me every morning yeah and if you're
growing 30 or 40 cannabis plants as a
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver you're putting yourself at risk
your patients medicine at risk just having
[SPEAKER_01]: that wafting down the alley like we
already had one kid get shot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach with an air rifle this summer
because someone's too stupid to put their
[SPEAKER_01]: shit in a fence if you throw a chain like
fence over teenagers aren't gonna bother
[SPEAKER_01]: they can barely work scissors little on
freaking wire cutters most of them are so
[SPEAKER_02]: lazy that they're not ready to steal
unless it's right in their face anyway
[SPEAKER_04]: right if you're growing in town don't
don't push the limits you know I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the thing we're getting at but
right like all of this is because one guy
[SPEAKER_01]: is being inconsiderate yes we're all gonna
get punished for that that kind of sucks
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody who would like to grow their own
cannabis plants in the city of Pueblo now
[SPEAKER_01]: has that right in jeopardy because one
jerk on the south side is stinking up his
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor's house but two jerks because
somebody had to shoot somebody also and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that contributes that's surely
not helping anybody well and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: another jerk out in this county
[SPEAKER_04]: he's the the main thing for the county
kind of doing the same thing that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: wanting to do the same thing that the
city's gonna do or try to do well the
[SPEAKER_01]: county's talking about proposed plant
limits is that right they are talking
[SPEAKER_04]: limits but regardless of caregivership or
anything like that it would be 18 plants
[SPEAKER_04]: per single-family residence 12 plants per
apartment or multifamily residence and it
[SPEAKER_04]: limits or forbids outdoor growing too so
that's you know that's ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the county the forbidding of
outdoor growing is just a silly gift to
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Hills that they don't deserve yeah
the Sun is free abundant energy and plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are meant to be outdoors and the only
reason marijuana was forced indoors to
[SPEAKER_01]: begin with was prohibition I don't know
about you guys but I love some summer
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor yeah and you say a lot of
ridiculous shit but that thing you just
[SPEAKER_02]: said about the only reason marijuana was
forced indoors was because of prohibition
[SPEAKER_02]: is one of the greatest things I've ever
heard you say every now and then a diamond
[SPEAKER_01]: falls out along with all the coal yeah
dude yeah you're kind of full of crap but
[SPEAKER_02]: once in a while you spit out a real gem
and I agree with you and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: moved to Colorado to the Pueblo area to
grow outdoors because this is an ideal
[SPEAKER_04]: climate there's the reason that uh most
the army troops that have been to
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanistan and Iraq go through Fort
Carson for training before they go there
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah they get some acclimated to the
similar environment we're up this altitude
[SPEAKER_02]: the air is thin the temperature is the
same yeah the Hindu Kush Valley does that
[SPEAKER_02]: mean that when uh when they take over and
they all come here that they're coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo shit Colorado is my favorite place
on the planet before we legalize I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's beautiful here the weather's gorgeous
the climate's wonderful the summers are
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing the food here is great believe the
sweet corn people you don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're missing the people are great in
Colorado right people are pretty chill
[SPEAKER_01]: when family comes to visit they always
comment on how nice the drivers are we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be driving up the highway and 30 people
will shift at lanes all in unison to let a
[SPEAKER_01]: semi who's slow up the on-ramp on and the
dude from New York will go what the fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: was that man what are you guys doing we're
not being dicks in unison isn't it amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't have to orchestrate or
communicate or nothing we just all weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: dicks at the same time somebody was
telling me a story about the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_02]: uh another person was in from out of state
I think New York somewhere upstate where
[SPEAKER_02]: they talked all crazy they spoke all crazy
uh but she said the friend that told me
[SPEAKER_02]: the story said he was walking up and down
the aisles going I can't believe it y'all
[SPEAKER_02]: is so nice here people is so nice and we
can smoke weed he just didn't believe how
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly and polite Colorado people are
one of the things I see on the internet a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot is uh people looking to come here and
check out our legal weed scene worried
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna be embarrassed and cause
problems or get grief from locals if they
[SPEAKER_01]: come here and get excited about legal weed
no live it the fuck up it's paradise here
[SPEAKER_02]: we kind of know we're the cool kid you
know what I mean we're like we know you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hang out come on we'll let you in
our group we're not we're not exclusive
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not celebrities we're just potheads
Jeff was with me in line on January 1st
[SPEAKER_01]: did you do my shopping the second time
yeah that was my second round did you do
[SPEAKER_04]: much were you at the shop all day on the
first no I didn't work in the front at all
[SPEAKER_01]: the first thing well I've seen it I saw
working a dispensary back in the good old
[SPEAKER_01]: days but on the first watching people make
their first legal weed purchase and do the
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got legal weed oh my god oh my god
shuffle that's just how I think of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: there walking out that it's more than a
strut it's more than a glide it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bounce kind of ticker walks like this it's
it doesn't matter if it was a gram or an
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce there's just just the feeling of
freedom yeah no one can take this away
[SPEAKER_01]: from you it's magical come enjoy it just
don't marine doubt yourself it has become
[SPEAKER_01]: a verb it's so dumb it became a verb
instantly I was uh I was actually I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know if I've said this on this show I was
the first person to buy recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis at the greener side dispensary in
Pueblo Colorado they claim that that dude
[SPEAKER_02]: in Pueblo West beat me but I don't care no
that's just where the news was they did
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing in Denver with the vet
being the first person the first person
[SPEAKER_02]: right and I walk out the door and there's
a camera crew sitting there and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like say something and being you know I've
got always got shit to say so I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: my name is Rasta Jeff and I was the first
person to buy recreational cannabis at the
[SPEAKER_02]: greener side dispensary in Pueblo Colorado
and then I screamed yeah I have no idea
[SPEAKER_02]: where that video went I'd love to see that
it's on somebody's documentary somewhere I
[SPEAKER_04]: would love to see where that went I had
some pictures on my old phone that went
[SPEAKER_02]: for a swim you sent me the great one of my
best Instagram and Twitter photos ever it
[SPEAKER_02]: came was actually taken by our friend
Jesse the one where the reporter is
[SPEAKER_02]: filming me and interviewing me and then
our buddy Walter is standing there looking
[SPEAKER_02]: like that photo was taken by you actually
that's a great shot yeah no that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool day that was a real that's a
memorable day I remember a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: from that day for sure oh I forgot a lot
of stuff from that day too so I was first
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought weed first and then I came home
and met up with my buddy that I did
[SPEAKER_02]: another podcast with back in the day and
him and I went back out there and took a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at our recording devices and went and
had a little bit of fun out there for that
[SPEAKER_02]: and by then I was already well known as
the first guy that bought pot I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: how everybody knew already it had only
been three or four hours there wasn't a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot to talk about in that line so the news
actually came to my house and filmed us
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I and another friend here hanging
out smoking and put that on the news yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little overexcited with my first
legal weed purchase as just an adult and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that was fun I'm glad that they were
way more fascinated with the dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_01]: and the dab rig than they were with the
pasty white guy in the corner I took two
[SPEAKER_02]: or three dabs when the camera crew was
here and they put the tiny shitty weak dab
[SPEAKER_02]: on the news yeah I was like oh you could
have put a real fat dab on the news if I
[SPEAKER_04]: remember right they didn't even actually
put the whole dab on either just me blown
[SPEAKER_01]: it out I think by then the camera guy was
a little late it wasn't his fault we got
[SPEAKER_01]: carried away and sort of hotbox this room
real fast there was a video camera guy and
[SPEAKER_02]: a still camera lady and the still camera
lady was talking about how she wished she
[SPEAKER_02]: could smoke but they drug test her so I
was making sure that you know they did a
[SPEAKER_02]: beat fucking street to Wendy's the
reporter lady she started off like next to
[SPEAKER_02]: me asking questions like so tell me about
this tell me about this she finished a
[SPEAKER_02]: report from the living room she was gone
and she went all she was hiding by the way
[SPEAKER_02]: out of her room yelling questions she had
the front door open getting air and shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and tell me more about cannabis it was so
fun I see her every other week at council
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings and she's always a real
sweetheart and tries to block me out of
[SPEAKER_01]: her shot of whoever's speaking just by
fate lines us up if she was if she wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to she could tip her camera up a degree
and a half and have my dumb mug in every
[SPEAKER_01]: background shot but she cuts me out and I
appreciate it you know you've been seen as
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy smoking bud here at the house you
don't need to be the guy on City Council
[SPEAKER_02]: also that'll look weird he's the one that
got this important news on the air I
[SPEAKER_01]: cleans up real good yeah this holds this
all started when a reporter from the Chief
[SPEAKER_01]: and sent me an email how he got my email I
have no earthly idea but I woke up to can
[SPEAKER_01]: you please find us someone from the
cannabis using community that wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: comment on the City Council attempting to
ban all home growing and I went wait what
[SPEAKER_01]: that's news to me and yeah it seems like
yeah the story we just told yeah a little
[SPEAKER_02]: stone so I'm kind of backtracking no
that's cool we need to remind the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that what's gonna happen is the draft will
be presented on October 15th to the City
[SPEAKER_02]: Council what we've got to do is go to the
City Council meeting on the 13th and kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of be preemptive show them look we know
this is coming we're here to influence you
[SPEAKER_02]: first come up with good reasons why it's
bullshit and if you have if you got a
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking voice if you're not scared to
speak in front of people go speak to the
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council it's a public forum explain
to them that they can't make us grow in
[SPEAKER_02]: private buildings because first that tells
the robbers right where our weed is second
[SPEAKER_02]: that tells your neighbors that you are
actually growing cannabis if they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: already know third you can't afford a damn
building no four that's gonna make more
[SPEAKER_02]: electricity for Black Hills to go wire up
that should be number one okay see all
[SPEAKER_02]: these reasons already add up second of all
what are we doing wrong there's a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of people screwing up right go make those
people correct their things don't punish
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole group for a couple of people
screw ups this does nothing to go over the
[SPEAKER_04]: actor try to attack the actual criminal
element that does happen from some home
[SPEAKER_01]: grows it's kind of nitpicking isn't it
right well the the person growing weed in
[SPEAKER_01]: their home on the black market for sale on
the black market isn't bothering to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: any of the rules and they're doing so
they're doing everything covertly because
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want to get caught and arrested
the people who are standing up following
[SPEAKER_01]: the letter of the law but being dickish
about it are just bringing a black guy to
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole community and causing everybody
problems if we legalize it if enough
[SPEAKER_01]: idiots screw up they're gonna take that
away the next president could send the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking marines like it's not that
outlandish in my head was just like
[SPEAKER_02]: because president romney will remember in
boston bomb oh that is don't ever say that
[SPEAKER_01]: your outdoor garden will get droned in
boston if we're not careful there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: manhunt for somebody after the boston
marathon bombings and they were going into
[SPEAKER_02]: every single house and searching every
single room looking for these suspects um
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine if they tried to do that here i
mean that was you know i mean no i'm being
[SPEAKER_04]: that wouldn't happen in colorado that only
will happen on the east coast we're one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most armed states there is i mean
imagine that type of shit going on they
[SPEAKER_01]: will such a bizarre state very liberal and
very gun friendly i don't know anyone who
[SPEAKER_01]: grew up here that can't like didn't grow
up shooting the guns go well with the
[SPEAKER_02]: liberalness yeah because you have to be
able to protect yourself being so liberal
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to and there's a lot of places
where you can fully get eaten by a bear
[SPEAKER_02]: still like that's a thing here 30 minutes
from here you can be eaten by several
[SPEAKER_04]: things 30 minutes from here hell they
found a moose down in the river earlier
[SPEAKER_04]: this summer that's one of the most deadly
creatures in north america and people do
[SPEAKER_02]: not respect the moose it does not have big
fangs now so they don't get afraid
[SPEAKER_01]: let's give a shout out to jesse for a
moose knuckle reference on the show that
[SPEAKER_01]: was pretty good i don't know can we
transition from moose knuckle to let me
[SPEAKER_02]: just finish it with saying i'm not too
afraid to get up get beat up by a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: moose knuckle now let's go to the part you
were going to do um as i blush and rub my
[SPEAKER_01]: face a little um i need more weed so one
of the things that just kills me i'd like
[SPEAKER_02]: to give you a dab but on the show you're
gonna choke for like 30 minutes give me
[SPEAKER_02]: the tiniest little baby girly dab start
talking while i get them ready i'll take
[SPEAKER_02]: one first and by the time you're done i'll
have a couple dabs going so uh one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that kills me about the cannabis
community is for the last 80 years or so
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been forced underground and into the
dark and then out of the way and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: sight and that's how we've survived and
that's how we've thrived but now that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: legal more of us need to stand the fuck up
and show up to city council and show up to
[SPEAKER_01]: vote and show up during budget meetings
and have our voices heard we're used to
[SPEAKER_01]: hiding and pretending like we're not part
of the system and we're against the system
[SPEAKER_01]: but we live here too it's our city too
we're we have just as much right to have
[SPEAKER_01]: our city be like we would like it as
anyone else in the city and if nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: shows up and speaks out against a ban on
all home growing that requires you to
[SPEAKER_01]: build a building city council's not gonna
care that it's ridiculous and
[SPEAKER_01]: unenforceable and a horrible idea they're
gonna go ahead and approve it because
[SPEAKER_01]: without thinking about it just on a quick
gut check it seems like you ought to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the right to wake up in the morning and
not smell marijuana and this ordinance
[SPEAKER_01]: might do that once for somebody maybe so
sure go ahead and approve it and if
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's willing to throw on some clean
clothes and show up
[SPEAKER_01]: for a minute we had a little cannabis
community group but they fell apart pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quick quite quickly like you don't need a
group though you just you just need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a citizen who's willing to show up monday
night at seven so here's something that
[SPEAKER_02]: i've kind of tossed around in my head uh
when when mike and i had a shop together
[SPEAKER_02]: it was owned by somebody else but you know
we ran that place there were a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: times we had to go to court for a couple
of things and uh to support a member of
[SPEAKER_02]: our group that had a court trial also we
went to a couple of city council things to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to speak up i look like your tip i i
know it i look like a cliche freaking
[SPEAKER_02]: pothead that's cool it's an email on a mic
card no problem just a little plastic it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not the first it's not the first time
that's happened to tell you the truth i
[SPEAKER_02]: had to learn how to take dabs with a mic
in front of me also so i'm talking about i
[SPEAKER_02]: used to go to those uh city council
meetings and then i'm saying i'm six foot
[SPEAKER_02]: five with dreadlocks to my ass dude my
dreadlocks go past my ass now i've got
[SPEAKER_02]: four foot ropes hanging off of my head he
does people not kidding yeah and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: nowhere to hide them and even if i put on
a collared shirt and i look good i've
[SPEAKER_02]: still got these rasta man dreadlocks dr
carl hart feels your pain sir i feel uh
[SPEAKER_02]: there's i'm almost a detriment to the
community when i go to city council
[SPEAKER_02]: meetings and show like look here's rasta
man here i feel like i'm a weight on the
[SPEAKER_02]: community when i show up i kind of hide
because of that i would say that you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: self-employed successful citizen of our
beautiful city and have as much of a right
[SPEAKER_01]: to stand up and claim your piece of it is
the best dressed cleanest shaved
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucker in here i was just gonna say
fuck yeah all right like you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: change who you are to stand up and be part
of city government everybody gets a vote
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody gets a say period the rules of
this the city council meetings anyone who
[SPEAKER_01]: comes and signs up um to speak before the
meeting i they usually limit it to six but
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been allowing more than six people
to speak at the beginning of most meetings
[SPEAKER_01]: lately because of uh all the hubbub and
the recall stuff but if you show up to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak you can you get your five minutes as
long as you're not cussing or throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: things you can say whatever you want and
there's these old crotchety people that
[SPEAKER_01]: show up and bitch about whatever their
passion issue is every two weeks at every
[SPEAKER_01]: single meeting they take five minutes at
the beginning of the meeting to stand up
[SPEAKER_01]: and say i don't like any of you i hate
what you're doing i need all of you to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop right now it's illegal i hate you but
he takes five minutes to do that at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of every meeting and he sits
down and his crotchety friend gets up and
[SPEAKER_01]: does the same thing and they're not any
more valid or legitimate than you with
[SPEAKER_01]: your dreadlocks or jesse with his beard or
me with my earrings just because i clean
[SPEAKER_01]: up a little better than y'all as far as
the cops are concerned doesn't mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: deserve less or more space in city council
than i take the only reason they talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: me is because i show up all the time and
i'm familiar face most people leave
[SPEAKER_01]: halfway through the meeting and then it's
just the people that are stuck there
[SPEAKER_01]: playing a role in going through the
pageantry of city government and because
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm willing to hang out for that last hour
i can call city council on at two o'clock
[SPEAKER_01]: in the afternoon and by eight o'clock i've
talked to the three of them personally for
[SPEAKER_01]: like 15 minutes each i'm a fucking stoner
too like i'm just willing to stand up and
[SPEAKER_02]: claim my little spot of the table i like
it my other question is am i gonna attract
[SPEAKER_02]: unwanted attention to myself like i'm not
doing anything i shouldn't be but am i
[SPEAKER_02]: going and speaking out as a weed head
looking like a weed head not bringing weed
[SPEAKER_01]: head trouble to myself the the cops are
too busy to especially give a shit yeah um
[SPEAKER_01]: a friend of mine likes to tell a story a
girlfriend got mad at him and called the
[SPEAKER_01]: cops and said my boyfriend's growing too
much weed and the cop went weed and hung
[SPEAKER_01]: up the phone we've got heroin falling off
the truck here we've got a teen pregnancy
[SPEAKER_01]: rate that rivals most counties high school
graduation rates like cops are busy the
[SPEAKER_01]: kids that's going to city council with
dreadlocks and standing up saying i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like this ordinance please don't vote for
it is not someone they need to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: now if you show up and throw a rock at
sandy daf they're probably gonna pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to who you are and follow you
out of the building and give you a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems but if you stand up and act like
a citizen they will treat you like a
[SPEAKER_01]: citizen because doing so anything else is
technically a crime can i wear a hat in
[SPEAKER_01]: the courtroom yep nice just tuck my dreads
up in there people show up in pajamas um
[SPEAKER_01]: the trash haulers are down there a lot a
lot of them come straight from work um
[SPEAKER_01]: amina rocky works full time is a mail
carrier and more often than not is in her
[SPEAKER_01]: work uniform like um even montoya shows up
in a t-shirt nine meetings out of ten um i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean if someone on the council is in a
t-shirt you should feel fine in a
[SPEAKER_01]: grassroots hat keeping your dreadlocks out
of your face like that's a lot of us he's
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to you guys it's really boring
it's it's city government it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people mumbling about really hyper
specific rules and it's sort of bore
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself to tears dull but it affects your
life on a number of in a number of ways
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly and right now they're looking to
kill countless small businesses and every
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver in the in the city limits with a
dumb rule trying to kill smells we just
[SPEAKER_04]: wrote them a pretty nice little sales tax
check for a first quarter business right
[SPEAKER_02]: for uh which business uh how often are you
at high growing or growing supplies uh a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more lately cool so more frequently
not to derail mike's subject here but guys
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people want to talk to jesse
about growing stuff from the show uh catch
[SPEAKER_02]: him at high growing or growing supplies
distract him so that he can't get his work
[SPEAKER_02]: done it's much more fun to stand there and
help you guys out than it is to stack shit
[SPEAKER_04]: up all day if you bring tabs down that's a
good way to distract me
[SPEAKER_02]: it's such a good thing you're the boss no
no i'm not well we've got to say that you
[SPEAKER_02]: are if you're taking tabs while you're
working i'm just above the law so guys
[SPEAKER_02]: come to city if you live in pueblo
colorado uh is it just city or does the
[SPEAKER_01]: county count if you're part of the county
come out to all of this stuff affects you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys if if the city bans all home growing
the county is going to experience a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive mass exodus of cannabis caregivers
into the county and with the fit
[SPEAKER_02]: folks show up and say my grow to build
another building would cause me to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: leave this town which would put five
people that i'm responsible for in some
[SPEAKER_02]: deep shit with their cannabis needs yeah i
would and where are they going to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's not there aren't going to
be any other caregivers to take my spot
[SPEAKER_02]: because they can't grow in their indoor
environment like not everybody's got a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding facility somewhere else to work
with some of us have to right some of us
[SPEAKER_04]: have to stick to the basement shit not to
mention i mean just the the loss of
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue um i i think amendment 64 is even
with pueblo um every corner they've been
[SPEAKER_04]: able to stopping having retail stores and
grows uh in city limits pueblo still
[SPEAKER_04]: prospered from amendment 64 you know and
in in small ways but you know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary employment that has come from 64
pueblo still enjoying all the electricians
[SPEAKER_01]: the plumbers the caregivers you know the
growth store people moving here makes a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of money from us yeah yeah i mean i
can't lie jesse just said they wrote a
[SPEAKER_04]: nice tax check i wish there was a higher
profit margin on it through the last
[SPEAKER_01]: depression the one growth store on fourth
street sprung up what three new locations
[SPEAKER_01]: and two new competitors bloomed yeah the
public ain't that big folks and we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: four now there are five or six hydroshocks
with the driving distance of here right
[SPEAKER_01]: right and they're all surviving just fine
because there's a lot of employment
[SPEAKER_02]: bleeding off this industry yeah i'm gonna
do a shameless plug right here i've been
[SPEAKER_02]: to all of the hydro shops in this town
that's no doubt at all all of them several
[SPEAKER_02]: times and there's a reason why i've chosen
one specific shop to be my sponsor yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: nice i was almost out there today just by
happenstance i needed something and that
[SPEAKER_02]: was what dawned on me is the place to go
yeah we're gonna have to work out some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of coupon code or something for the
agricultural listeners i've been thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: that too yeah if right now just off the
top if you mentioned that you listen to
[SPEAKER_04]: this show and you're buying something tell
us you know and we'll take care of you
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll probably come up with something
official it'll probably only work at the
[SPEAKER_04]: pueblo location because uh jesse's not in
denver yeah but um tell him anyways um and
[SPEAKER_04]: uh we'll get something worked out in
denver nice you guys hear that we're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: get a coupon code or some sort of deal for
you guys for listening i'm also going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do some giveaways i just haven't decided
how to do it uh i've got a couple of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: items possibly some titanium and possibly
a t-shirt and maybe a couple of hat pins
[SPEAKER_02]: that need to be given away to listeners i
just need good ideas on how to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: instagram and facebook giveaways feel
cheesy if you give them to me i'll hand
[SPEAKER_01]: them out to anybody who talks not retarded
at council i was gonna say i'll take one
[SPEAKER_02]: to sandy daft give her an irie genetics
pin yep give me an irie give me irie
[SPEAKER_01]: shirts for all of them
[SPEAKER_04]: um there was uh back on the subject of the
proposed ordinance um they mentioned
[SPEAKER_04]: something about uh landlords in there and
i kind of thought that was bs too um i
[SPEAKER_04]: know a couple local landlords uh one of
them has over 30 properties and the other
[SPEAKER_04]: one has 18 properties and some of those
are big duplexes or apartment buildings um
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't care they actually tell their
tenants they don't care that um you know
[SPEAKER_04]: i'm sorry i can't name them but um they
don't care golden information in this
[SPEAKER_04]: state you see almost all of their tenants
grow almost all of their tenants pay rent
[SPEAKER_04]: on time they take care of their houses uh
they love them um they you know so i don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know where they came up with landlords are
pissed about this but they it's because no
[SPEAKER_01]: one in the industry stands up if you're on
city council or if you're the police chief
[SPEAKER_01]: or the fire chief you don't meet
caregivers like you two you meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver who set his fucking house on
fire you meet the caregiver who got to or
[SPEAKER_01]: got drunk at the bar and backed into the
somebody's car with three pounds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trunk and like they're just blasting ash
in the backyard right yeah somebody blew
[SPEAKER_01]: their garage apart open blasting and
smoking a cigarette at the same time it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a good point um and because you guys are
good at what you do and you've never blown
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself up or set
[SPEAKER_04]: your house on fire they've never met you
they've never heard of you they've
[SPEAKER_02]: never seen this if you guys want pictures
check out uh i read genetics on instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: also check out jesse grows on instagram
lots of great pot pictures yes while
[SPEAKER_02]: you're at it download instagram while
you're at it follow our friend garden of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed in on instagram if you want high high
quality cannabis pictures if you like pot
[SPEAKER_04]: porn do what he just said yeah no porn
there's a reason he uh just want a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: little uh secret cup there man who's good
to look up uh i was dabbing i looked up
[SPEAKER_02]: and suddenly jesse was at the secret cup i
had no idea you were coming i thought that
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty sweet yeah it just flew up real
quick and then i blinked and he was gone i
[SPEAKER_04]: was literally repotting plants i was like
fuck it i'm gonna go nice i think uh it
[SPEAKER_02]: was about 45 minutes to get there i think
your travel time was more than what you
[SPEAKER_04]: spent there yeah probably so yeah yeah but
it uh best uh drive time ever you know it
[SPEAKER_04]: was so like exciting watching him but it
was just so cool yeah once again big shout
[SPEAKER_02]: out to our buddy spence for uh taking home
the first place at the secret cup mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: region i keep wishing him the best of luck
in vegas but i'm pretty sure he's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it home for us oh yeah you put this
little town on the map bro yeah and see i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean for something so positive too we're
always on the map for some psychotically
[SPEAKER_01]: horrid shit yeah it's so nice when it's
positive you know um another thing i just
[SPEAKER_04]: want to say is most caregivers basements
i've seen that that's just a general term
[SPEAKER_04]: for where their girl is um most of them
are way cleaner than most dispensaries uh
[SPEAKER_04]: girls i've seen that's just the honest
truth nine days out of ten i'd be happy
[SPEAKER_02]: eating off jeff's grill room floor i'm
kind of i've got a little bit of ocd and
[SPEAKER_02]: that plays very well being a pot farmer it
does it plays and you'll notice my front
[SPEAKER_02]: yard is clean my backyard is clean the
sides of my house are clean i asked my
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors neighbors to remove some debris
they had over there they had a trailer
[SPEAKER_02]: with like old wood they had chopped down
and they didn't take it away for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time i was like i need to be a particular
but could you possibly take away that wood
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you need some more reasons why i'll
let you know why it's bugging me they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like i'm sorry we'll get rid of it and
they took because it's bugs dude i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need every little board uh my weeds are
pulled all the time my garden my backyard
[SPEAKER_02]: garden is clean uh because i can't afford
the bugs that that will bring that will
[SPEAKER_02]: bring more problems and it also makes your
house look like shit and being a pot
[SPEAKER_02]: grower i want to be a good citizen and not
make my house look like shit i mean that's
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the thing no one sees this no one
sees how well most of the industry does it
[SPEAKER_01]: they uh most of city council hasn't
bothered to go out and visit any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal marijuana stores in town some of
which have been open for like seven eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years now i mean how long has marisol been
open and they can't make that drive i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not exactly the best example i could
have thrown out but like it's been there
[SPEAKER_02]: the longest and that's the first
dispensary we got in pueblo we got to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them credit it's the first and i mean you
can't go out there and check if if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's so scary and should be
fought like shouldn't you understand your
[SPEAKER_01]: opponent to kill it or at least some
nonsense like that and go see it once some
[SPEAKER_01]: jedi shit right there bro but it's so
scary if they see it from the parking lot
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll have to go in and inject some
marijuana's if you're growing indoors walk
[SPEAKER_02]: into your grow room and close your eyes
and breathe and if it smells like wet or
[SPEAKER_02]: smells like plants you're doing it wrong
you need more ventilation you need more
[SPEAKER_02]: air out and more fresh air in you don't
want to be able to smell that shit in your
[SPEAKER_02]: own grow room you shouldn't be able to
smell it in there this random grow tip has
[SPEAKER_01]: been brought to you by originetics i'm
just thinking about filtration and shit if
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna grow indoors yeah i gotta
order a couple carbon filters by the way
[SPEAKER_02]: if we're gonna be growing indoors and
doing it right that's that's how you know
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not putting humidity and mildew
problems into the house and that's how you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you're filtering it to your neighbors
aren't gonna complain i blew a guy's mind
[SPEAKER_04]: the other day uh sold him an intake a
carbon filter for the intake that's so
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet when i first told him about it he
was like sounds like a waste of money and
[SPEAKER_04]: within 45 seconds he was like oh oh oh wow
yeah it's like dude it even like it makes
[SPEAKER_04]: your light bulbs last longer i mean
everything it's just it's better yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon filters guys uh carbon scrubbers if
you're not using it to just uh pull the
[SPEAKER_02]: air out of the room that you're growing in
put a filter with a blower in there just
[SPEAKER_02]: right in the middle of the room either on
the floor or hanging in the ceiling to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the air clean and keep air moving you
can't have too much airflow in your grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room you really can't random tips from
some pros today and we have really good
[SPEAKER_01]: air here too so had everyone in town
taking that advice at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer we would not be here recording this
episode i'm a really you know i'm an
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor grower um it's hard to keep that
stink away i i don't have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestion at the same time have you ever
had a neighbor no but where where i i've
[SPEAKER_01]: been in many back door or backyard gardens
back jesus understand i've been in many
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard gardens something weird on your
mind that kind of and uh i haven't seen a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of pissed off neighbors on either side
generally because unless you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: in large quantities or you're really good
at it you're not gonna produce a level of
[SPEAKER_01]: stink that's there for more than two weeks
at any sort of obnoxious level i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not talking more than like the dog
shit from the guy next door who hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: raked it up in a couple of weeks or the
compost pile that's baking in the sun type
[SPEAKER_01]: odor here it's not that strong it's just
peculiar and unless you're a real dick
[SPEAKER_01]: your neighbor's not gonna call the cops
and every member of city council instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of you they're also they're also those
people that claim just the smell of pot
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me sick i get a headache and i think
that's bullshit because i've smelled some
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of shit and no smells have ever
really given me a headache uh just
[SPEAKER_02]: smelling something probably that's but
there are some people that love to cling
[SPEAKER_02]: to a problem or a well they're like right
now there's a lot of people looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about marijuana to gripe about
which we're seeing a lot of out in pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: west right now and these folks that are
sneaking out their neighbors are really
[SPEAKER_01]: you're hurting the cause man we we
succeeded and we got full legalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: now we've got people looking to throw
anchors at us and it sucks good job on the
[SPEAKER_04]: stink but man turn it down my in-laws live
in pueblo west every sunday we go out
[SPEAKER_04]: there and eat dinner with them i grew up
out there so or well i went to high school
[SPEAKER_04]: out there i drive around and stuff like
that uh take different roads every single
[SPEAKER_04]: time i can find two or three plants
sticking above the fence uh there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: place out there uh his hoop houses he have
in his backyard kind of remind me of what
[SPEAKER_04]: greener side looks like you know i mean
they're they're they're pushing it they're
[SPEAKER_04]: pushing the limits they're being assholes
um and that sucks i thought about go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the mountains i thought about doing some
plants in my backyard i was gonna buy one
[SPEAKER_02]: of those 10 by 10 dog runs and a little
greenhouse and put the greenhouse inside
[SPEAKER_02]: the dog run but uh like seven out of ten
growers that have grown some outdoor pot
[SPEAKER_02]: this year have either had caterpillars or
thieves in this neighborhood and i'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna pass on the outdoor one of the
things most people don't take into account
[SPEAKER_01]: for the outdoor is you're giving up like
90 of your control so that you can also
[SPEAKER_01]: give up 90 of your energy costs and 99
percent of your control well yeah 95 yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you would be much more qualified to
speak on this and environmentally yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: weather and you can do weather and bugs
are gonna kick your ass all summer long i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean i just grew a bunch of veggies
outdoor this year in the weather and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs pretty much killed me but i still got
a massive harvest that did use old pot
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt to grow veggies i know a bunch of
growers that gave me two truck fulls of
[SPEAKER_04]: old pot dirt mix it with sand so it holds
water a little better i mixed it with that
[SPEAKER_01]: clay crap pablo was built on yeah work
like a charm folks i got zucchinis the
[SPEAKER_02]: size of jeff he brought me some some
jalapenos some tomatoes i got a nice bag
[SPEAKER_02]: of produce one night that was pretty nice
yeah it's nice being the hippie kid in the
[SPEAKER_02]: in the group because all my farmer friends
jesse was bringing me killer tomatoes i
[SPEAKER_02]: can't even eat a damn tomato any now any
any way now after eating the stuff that he
[SPEAKER_04]: gave me why sure tomatoes are just woman
my uh shit to fucking it uh it totally uh
[SPEAKER_04]: got a second leg her second wind yeah
that's crazy i rarely eat eggs because uh
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of a dietary decision but also
because eggs are disgusting uh but then
[SPEAKER_02]: jesse brought me a few eggs and i was like
let's give it a try and i cracked them
[SPEAKER_02]: open and the yolk on the inside it looked
healthy they smelled good uh and those
[SPEAKER_02]: eggs were tasty i fried them up and made
some my egg and i forgot what i even did
[SPEAKER_02]: but those were so good and not
store-bought processed gmo shit uh those
[SPEAKER_02]: real eggs and that real vegetables you
brought me so good garden fresh man grow
[SPEAKER_04]: your own you guys grow your own extra
links and expense to ensure non-gmo food

back and clap when someone says something
[SPEAKER_01]: you like you know just unless you're going
crazy they're not even going to notice you
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to thank you for speaking
and i mean even if you're there yelling at
[SPEAKER_01]: them and telling which i've done before
you can fully pull a video of me berating
[SPEAKER_04]: city council for dragging their feet
online nice um if we had like 80 people
[SPEAKER_04]: show up do you think they would ever bring
up a pot ordinance again if we had 80
[SPEAKER_01]: people show up they would do whatever we
asked if we had five people show up this
[SPEAKER_01]: ordinance would never see the light of day
the public meeting that we're asking you
[SPEAKER_01]: to attend is on the 13th it's officially
being the ordinance is officially being
[SPEAKER_01]: presented to city council on the 15th if
half a dozen of us show up on the 13th and
[SPEAKER_01]: three or four of us stand up and speak and
say we think this is a terrible ordinance
[SPEAKER_01]: it's unenforceable it's really bad for
pueblo there's no point don't do it and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not psychotic about it when they
present it on the 15th it'll get killed
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately and it will never make it onto
the official agenda it will never be voted
[SPEAKER_01]: on by city council it'll die quickly if 30
or 40 of us show up we'll have the city
[SPEAKER_01]: overlay for the retail stores shaken out
of this planning and zoning commission
[SPEAKER_01]: months earlier than we would otherwise
right now no one shows up no one stands up
[SPEAKER_01]: no one's called city council to bitch
about not seeing this yet and so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: dragging their feet and we're not going to
see it till after the elections in
[SPEAKER_01]: november yep so if you're listening to

[SPEAKER_02]: twitter monster um i usually end the show
and then uh come back and wrap it up but
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm just gonna do it now because uh we've
got it going on guys i want to ask my my
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners for one thing i need a theme
song um i've been playing other artists
[SPEAKER_02]: songs and i've been playing that one
reggae song you hear is a theme that i
[SPEAKER_02]: made on itunes it's not acceptable or on
garage band sorry that's not acceptable if
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody would make me a super cool theme
about two minutes long maybe uh say a few
[SPEAKER_02]: key phrases i grow culture podcast hosted
by rasta jeff brought to you by i read
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics you know uh i would make it up to
you in some sort of way depending on what
[SPEAKER_02]: state you live in and how old you are we
could work on a little compensation but
[SPEAKER_02]: there would definitely be some pay in
there i'm not begging i just need a theme
[SPEAKER_02]: song i'm tired of listening to that cheesy
reggae tune i made and i've been putting
[SPEAKER_02]: the show on you on youtube and youtube
gets mad at me for using all those other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's songs i've got their written
permission all the artists that i use i've
[SPEAKER_02]: got permission proving that to google's
tricky exactly they don't even care if you
[SPEAKER_02]: do prove it they're like that email
doesn't mean shit to us we need a written
[SPEAKER_02]: letter from a record label with notary and
yeah sorry dude have bono call us yeah and
[SPEAKER_02]: the artists i'm using are actually my
friends it's like mystic roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: taskrock and i've been like hey can i use
your music and like yeah of course bro so
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like you know they've said yes but
that's as far as we've gotten yeah you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't play google that voicemail that's
right so somebody if you want to write i
[SPEAKER_02]: like reggae obviously if you wanted to
write a couple of them that'd be badass
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe one for the start of the show one
for the end of the show maybe a short
[SPEAKER_02]: piece for like between segments uh
something with a real aggressive dance
[SPEAKER_02]: hall reggae beat would be pretty smooth i
don't know i'm just begging at this point
[SPEAKER_02]: i could use a theme song that's what i'm
trying to get at he also likes death metal
[SPEAKER_01]: like so he's a big slayer fan so anything
with there's nothing like getting real
[SPEAKER_02]: high and just listening to a thousand
beats per minute in your head right please
[SPEAKER_02]: don't do that don't waste your energy
we'll play when jesse comes on we like and
[SPEAKER_02]: jesse don't do that don't do that i like
reggae i like some funky shit i'm a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: fish grateful dead kind of guy so you know
i grow culture podcast needs a theme song

another if you're in colorado i'll get

[SPEAKER_02]: guys i'm back after a couple of tremendous
dabs forgot to do a couple things i want
[SPEAKER_02]: to give a huge shout out to joey and also
my good friend Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint and I went up to Denver to the
Denver Improv on Thursday night,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we saw Joey Coco Diaz do an amazing
set of comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey's one of my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: He freaking crushed the Denver Improv,
and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the show, he took a few minutes to
hang out with Clint and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he hung out with everybody,
but then Clint said something to him that
[SPEAKER_02]: got his attention, so he hung out with
Clint and I for quite a while and
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshitted one on one.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he was walking away, he patted me on
the shoulder, and he said, Ross the Jeff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I love you, right, cocksucker?
[SPEAKER_02]: And for Joey Diaz to call you a cocksucker
is actually an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great, and I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the great and amazing show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out with me for an hour
after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Clint, thanks for going with me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to go to more comedy shows
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also make sure you check out the Wild
Cousins.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Clint's comedy group that he is a
part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are a listener, a regular
listener, you remember that around episode
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, I said that I would start paying a
dollar every time I say the F word because
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to not say the F word on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need somebody to go back and listen from
episode 30 to 34 and let me know how many
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars I owe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sick child in need, and I had a
conversation with one of his parents,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was his uncle, and I said that
I would help them out when the time came
[SPEAKER_02]: up, and so this is my obligation to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's only a dollar, but what I'm
going to do now, starting on episode 35,
[SPEAKER_02]: every time I say the F word, it costs me
$5.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will donate $5 to this sick kid,
the sick child, and try to help out their
[SPEAKER_02]: life a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'll need though is I need somebody
to tweet me or email me or let me know
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way you can do that, you can tweet
me at iGrowCulture, you can email me
[SPEAKER_02]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com, you can
Facebook me, it's just iGrowCulture,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just let me know how many times I'm
saying the F word.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from 30 to 34, it's $1.
[SPEAKER_02]: From 35 on, it's going to be $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does not count to the guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guests can come and they can say
whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody start tallying it up for me
and send me a bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to contact these people once
I've got a total, and then I will let them
[SPEAKER_02]: know that I want to do this, and if they
accept the donation, I'll send it to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also if they are willing or if they
want me to reveal their identity,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will, and that way you guys can see who
I'm helping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I got one more ad to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is brought to you by our
friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treethugger.com, live music lifestyle
magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: For concert, festival, news, and reviews,
check out treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to send a personal shout out to
Ryan from Treethugger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I see what you're doing with
yourself, and I'm proud of you,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I am still looking for that
theme song.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody has made a theme song for me,
please shoot it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send it to me at iGrowCulture at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just want to send an instrumental,
I can do all the voiceovers and say the
[SPEAKER_02]: name of the show and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would appreciate it, and I'd definitely
make it worth your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm going to take a couple more
dabs, and when I get back, we'll do a
[SPEAKER_02]: lesson on drying and curing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got a text message, and it's Jesse,
and he says he will be here in five
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang on, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what's up, ladies and
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess who finally decided to show up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our good buddy, Jesse Grose, is back.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing tonight, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fashionably late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fashionably late.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a lot of fashion in you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just chilling out, putting together
a really nice episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people have been asking for the dry
and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they will be proud of what we
bring them today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse actually said that he could use a
little, what is it, a primer lesson?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it's called, on how to cure
some herbs?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been real happy with any of my
cure jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told they're great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel I have a lot of room for
improvement there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your standards on your own product are
always higher than everybody else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your own expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never satisfied with my herb or
anything, and everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when I play music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that could have been better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, no, dude, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, that was sloppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can feel the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snowboarding as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me on a snowboard, it's like trying to put
a telephone pole on a snowboard,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's just a lot of me rolling down a
hill on my face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, I thought you snowboarded
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, but I spend more time on the lift
and on my ass than I do on the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: board.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The left knee disagrees with the snowboard
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like my left knee wants to fly
out of the socket the entire time I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: strapped in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't ski for a similar reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me to move to skis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it wouldn't hurt as bad if I
skied.
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll try that this winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Case to case.
[SPEAKER_02]: My snowboard friends have moved away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're here to talk about curing herb,
not talking about curing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I guess curing herb will cure
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking into a circle because I'm
really dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We burned out the e-nail, I think,
and had to switch over to the regular rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: The e-nail couldn't keep up with the
puddles we were putting on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it took a shit today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hey, giddy up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember what you're telling me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to giddy up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran into giddy on Chatroulette.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said something about sending me a
G-nail, homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't forget it, because my nail just
took a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be great timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to cure some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why everybody's listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You doing good, Rob, by the way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of skipped right over and
introduced you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having a good day?
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you're working hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take some dabs, take a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll record.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to cure some weed,
you're going to need a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have a dehumidifier,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have an air conditioner,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You for sure need fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need what I call a hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a thermometer with a humidity
reading on it also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're going to need some kind of
jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer glass mason jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going a little bigger,
there's a company, I think it's called
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick Vac.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little suction vac lid jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them at most of the head shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are pretty chill to cure your weed
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't like them because
those are plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they leave any taste or
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going bigger, I like to buy
those Rubbermaid 32 quart containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big container.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a two-handed container.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fit a lot of herb in one of those
to cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to need something to cure
it in and a room to get it started to cure
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed Rosenthal actually taught me that
curing begins at the start of harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how much I subscribe to Ed's
teaching, but in a sense, that is
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute you cut down that plant,
you're starting the curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need that herb to dry uniformly,
not too fast, not too slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it in a hot room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it in a cool room.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our lessons before, we talked about
harvest and drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended drying as when where the sticks
on your buds snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much where we decided we
were entering cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've done everything right,
you've got all your leaves off,
[SPEAKER_02]: your buds have dried evenly in a nice room
that was temperature controlled,
[SPEAKER_02]: not too fast, not too cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the sticks are snapping and the buds
are a little bit damp, a little bit juicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you squeeze them, they kind of stick to
your fingers, but they kind of spring back
[SPEAKER_02]: to life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't crush them when you squeeze
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want them to have a little spring left
into them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't be deceived by the crunchy
layer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes there's a lot more leaf on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get tricked either way by
letting it over dry and also by thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: it's dry too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed dries from the outside or from
the outside in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though the outside leaves are
crispy and dry, the inside could be really
[SPEAKER_02]: juicy still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little buds are going to dry quicker than
the big buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to cut, when I grow a big bud,
actually cut that all down into the little
[SPEAKER_02]: golf ball size nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're one of my patients, you usually
get a bag full of golf balls is what I
[SPEAKER_02]: give you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do when I'm doing like the final trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes when they're hanging,
the bigger buds are a little harder to
[SPEAKER_04]: break down sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing to do with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to put them on a rack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to let them hang.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right before we're going to cure,
this is when the sticks will pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything's all trimmed up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any leaves left.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're manicured the way you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you grab one of the buds,
you pick it up and you bend the stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to bend like a straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to actually break,
pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to leave it until it like
explodes and breaks because then you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: little too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too dry or too wet of cannabis will not
cure properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're too dry, you've already missed
your point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get stale buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to put it in the jar and
waste time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're too wet and you try to cure it,
you're actually going to promote mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want it about right where those
sticks snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you're going to start the
curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read you what I wrote of what
curing actually is and what the purpose of
[SPEAKER_02]: curing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just what I wrote down to give an
actual reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Curing is used to remove excess moisture
to convert complex carbs back into sugars
[SPEAKER_02]: while removing chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorophyll is green pigment and
chlorophyll makes your buds taste harsh
[SPEAKER_02]: and smell bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also makes your buds burn partly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys ever smoked herb that kind of
maybe tastes like you just stuck your
[SPEAKER_02]: tongue in a light socket and you just want
to scrape your tongue off or you need a
[SPEAKER_02]: drink real bad, that stuff was not dried
and cured properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not flushed properly either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, as THC dries, the THC dries in your
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it dries more slowly, the more slower
it loses its water moisture, the more
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive it will become.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the water comes out of that THC,
that's when it's ripe and nice and prime
[SPEAKER_02]: for you to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by curing it, you slowly let that
happen and you don't destroy the THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't destroy your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, curing allows aerobic
bacteria to consume the chlorophyll in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorophyll is what we want to remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aerobic bacteria sounds like a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a good thing in this
instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aerobic bacteria is made from air,
light, and moisture being sealed inside of
[SPEAKER_02]: that jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do, I actually take my buds that
snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fill my mason jar about 90% of the way
full.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to squish them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to lightly set them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I seal that jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as that jar is sealed,
the aerobic bacteria begins to form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that aerobic bacteria will start
eating away the chlorophyll in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you open that jar, that's when the
reaction will restart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you want to do, what I do,
is I put the buds in the jar, I seal it
[SPEAKER_02]: up, and then I wait about two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go open the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that first time I'll pour the buds out
onto my little tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to feel the buds and make sure
they're not, they haven't gotten really
[SPEAKER_02]: moist or they haven't, if you can see
sweat inside the jar, get them out of
[SPEAKER_02]: there immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them out of there right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take them out of the jar and I start
squeezing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to feel a little bit of
moisture at the edge, because it's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the middle on the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want them to be damp and
sticky, or I'm afraid they're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll leave them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This first time, I dump them out and check
them all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I leave them sitting out for a couple of
minutes if I feel like they need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll put them back in the jar and
seal that jar up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're properly dry, like I'm hoping
they are at this point, I'll leave it
[SPEAKER_02]: closed for four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, and I know this sounds tedious,
but this is where, this is what separates
[SPEAKER_02]: the pros from the regular growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you get that super high
grade cured cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff you're getting at the
dispensary that tastes kind of hay-like,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't mean to call out the shops,
but they don't have time or space or
[SPEAKER_02]: manpower or the patience to cure herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your caregiver or your private grower or
you are the only way you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: good cured herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dispensary is not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes, you can taste the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste whatever other plant it was
growing next to or hanging next to in the
[SPEAKER_02]: dry room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste that in these dispensary
buds, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are very few shops that are actually
curing their herb, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't work there, so I can't tell you
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were going to say there's
very few shops flushing their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to let me know when
we... That's where we'll go there and get
[SPEAKER_02]: some herbal in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you got to put your buds back in the
jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seal the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wait four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I open it again, and then I
want to check the buds and make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not getting too much moisture is
not coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I feel like it's really humid inside of
the jar, I say humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not too humid inside of the jar,
I'll put them back in there, seal it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and let them sit for like six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much increase the time just by a
couple of hours until I get to about 12
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once you're checking them twice a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'll do six hours, and then I'll do
like 10 hours, and then I'll wait till
[SPEAKER_02]: about 12 hours, and then I'll usually open
them like every morning when I wake up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then right before I go to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about 12 hours usually in my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you pop open the jar, make sure it's
not too moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it sit open for just like 10 or 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to exchange the air and then
seal it back up and let it sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've got it to a point where you
know it's not going to get any mold in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when I like to just seal it up and
leave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't open it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should burn really nicely at this
point, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: It should burn nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys have ever had
perfectly cured herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know that herb you can smell down
the block?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going, oh man, that stuff was
slowly dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: It let all of the chlorophyll sneak out,
and it let all of the flavor that should
[SPEAKER_02]: have been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the chlorophyll disappears,
that's when the other colors, the reds and
[SPEAKER_02]: the purples start popping up, and you can
start seeing those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what gives you really pretty
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when the THC is allowed to dry
slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when it becomes more
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not completely sure about the
terpenoids, but it sounds like we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: give these terpenoids a little bit of time
to cure in there also, so they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting destroyed or taken out along with
the chlorophyll or with the moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we let it go slowly, I think we're
making it smell better because we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: something to the terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I know about them,
they seem very fragile too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is, you know, mild or moderate
temperatures in darkness, I think,
[SPEAKER_04]: are all very key to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I read that terpenoids evaporate
at approximately 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We read on another episode about 106
degrees was I think where we said,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I think it's right around 100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of your guys' drying and curing
rooms are getting that hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, I need a sip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, all those dabs got me all dried up
and thirsty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we took some monster dabs before the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to keep opening those jars
until you're confident that it's not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to mold up in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a little bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kyle likes his buds a little more
moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Adam will take a nicely dried
and cured bud that I've given him and
[SPEAKER_02]: he'll set that shit out all day until it's
crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he grinds it up in the grinder to
where it's dust and takes heroic sized
[SPEAKER_02]: bong hits out of it because that's what he
likes to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you want to do is I like to get
it to where it's not fluffy, but it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: some squishy to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a nice hard dense snug,
you want to be able to give it a squeeze
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just pops back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to crush it and you don't
want dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that dry dusty buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you try to store your
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it gets stored for up to nine
months, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my patients, I can give them their
whole year supply at once and they're fine
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my other patients ask me to hold
onto it for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of them want indoor bud
throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all a balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last couple of years, my stuff that's
gone out in nine, 10 months, I just,
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wasn't happy with it by the time
it was that age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's work on curing a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet that those buds will store
longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I messed up in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do pretty much what you do for the two
hour, pull it out of the jar and the four
[SPEAKER_04]: hour, but then it normally, it'll go 24
hours, 18 hours before I mess with it
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to set some alarms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my iPhone full of alarms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just ridiculous beeps.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think I'm doing something crazy
because every two hours I got to run away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be back, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to go somewhere and go pop
open a bunch of jars and then go back and
[SPEAKER_02]: get them.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using larger batches,
I guess I should have covered this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like to do is get one of those big,
they're like purple Tupperware containers,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rubbermaid containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill that up with your, you can leave it
on the sticks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer it off the stick for this curing
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill those containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I actually flip them upside down
and take the container off the lid instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of taking the lid off the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you leave a more exposed area and then
just pop that container back onto the lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try not to squish any buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop it open, lift the container off the
lid, sit in there like a tray full of
[SPEAKER_02]: buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gets a lot of airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to use those, uh, actually the same
ones that are same, similar size,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, but they're like the size of a brownie
pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, those work for a short term
storage pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, I talked about we should
have a dehumidifier, an AC unit,
[SPEAKER_02]: fans, a hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to back up and talk a little bit
about how Ed Rosenthal says curing starts
[SPEAKER_02]: at harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you pack your jar.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to overpack it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am learning, but I think there's a
lot of validity to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, uh, I think when you overpack it,
you create, you know, possible different
[SPEAKER_04]: little micro climates in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you almost prevent the aerobic acid
from being able to form in there when you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have enough oxygen.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what creates aerobic acid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think I said before was oxygen,
light and moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need plenty of that air in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about giving it light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys a little bit of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get it started, it's going,
I'm fixing the echoes in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in a really small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real echoey today.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fan that we're fighting with,
but I'm going to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got it just there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, Ed Rosenthal says that
curing starts from pretty much when you
[SPEAKER_02]: cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your buds have gotten too dry,
they're not going to cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to crumble.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your buds are too moist, you still have
a chance, but hopefully they didn't dry
[SPEAKER_02]: too quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you got to cut down the plant and get
all those leaves off and let it dry nice
[SPEAKER_02]: and slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're talking about a room with
a dehumidifier with an air conditioner and
[SPEAKER_02]: some fans and a hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep your plants between 60
and 75 degrees at about 50% humidity until
[SPEAKER_02]: you put them in this jar, until they reach
that stick snap in period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, that's how you keep them from
not drying too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a guy that, uh, a long time ago,
I used to have to buy some herb and this
[SPEAKER_02]: guy usually had the greatest bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was bugging him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, you got any more of that
LA confidential?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any more of that LA
confidential?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kept telling me, I harvested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was getting eager.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, I asked him and he's like,
sure, man, I'll bring it to you tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he brought it to me and it was,
it was a really weird texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like a pine cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was hard, but it was also squeezy,
but the outside was really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he broke it open and the middle
was soft and it was kind of fluffy on the
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I immediately called him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the hell happened,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that he dried it by opening
the oven and setting it next to the oven
[SPEAKER_02]: so that it would dry it out all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a prime example of what not to
do to dry your herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could taste it and smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made the weed smell like spaghetti
sauce, like it smelled like marinara for
[SPEAKER_02]: some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first thing that came to
mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to kill all the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sort of tomato-y paste or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to get that herb dried properly
and slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to dry it up too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything to add to curing,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we went over that really super
quickly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just really stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to project a lot of my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need crayons?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the dehumidifier, the AC unit,
the fans, the hygrometer, you need that
[SPEAKER_04]: regardless of where you're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to keep, you need a proper room
for drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of guys are just throwing it in
their closet or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a good area for drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep the air moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason for a dehumidifier,
what we're trying to do is we are pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: water out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That water ends up in the atmosphere
around your plants and then it has nowhere
[SPEAKER_02]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to suck that water out of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dehumidifier is a perfect place for
that water to go and you can reuse that
[SPEAKER_02]: water to water your plants later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some good water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do know if you're, if say
you're drying of not a lot of plants in a
[SPEAKER_04]: large room in the Southwest, you might
actually want a humidifier to help slow
[SPEAKER_04]: things down.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to, you know, kind of help out
people regionally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of talking about Colorado,
but as long as you need to keep it about
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 to 75 degrees that cool, actually I
think will make your buds dry a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it hardens them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I got to mention dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that dry room dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drying and curing should happen in mostly
a dark area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like literally a room, exact two
same climates, one that's dark and one
[SPEAKER_04]: that's light.
[SPEAKER_04]: The room with lights going to,
the plants are going to dry faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of, yeah, just kind of
experience I have with my dry room and
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping a window open sometimes and not,
and I know nothing else changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys, it is going to take a little bit
of practice to get your drying and curing
[SPEAKER_02]: method down, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to ruin a jar or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seal that jar up, go to sleep,
open it the next day and you open it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it smells like ammonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might've just kind of killed that
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not moldy, if you don't see any
mold, break it open as small as you can
[SPEAKER_02]: get those buds, pour it out on a tray,
let it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste it, give it a smoke, see if it
tastes all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be smokable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you left it in there too long and it
molded up, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember what you did, fix it next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that same shit again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always start with clean jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time today cleaning jars
and thinking, man, this really sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't, you know, but it's,
you know, every little thing counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anybody tried to cut off their feet
and stick cloning gel on their ankles so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can clean ourselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we need to make more growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to be a good grower sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is so much, like you got to do the
growing work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to do life and then you got to
clean up after yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always the part that gets
skipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got to go start by cleaning
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys keep your grow rooms clean
because it builds up quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got to clone yourself because
you just can't keep everything going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could, two of me would crush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a lot of money and you have no
shame and you want to clean pots and scrub
[SPEAKER_04]: floors and all that and come to Colorado
and learn how to grow weed, get in contact
[SPEAKER_04]: with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just make, did you just offer an
apprenticeship almost?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but they got to pay to start the
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to pay to start it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going to be the employee
that carries buckets and sweeps floors and
[SPEAKER_02]: mops up the shit for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And someday they'll be the bombest
dispensary owner there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll teach them how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to pass on these skills to people
because one day I'm going to be not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say get hit by a truck or
something, but I didn't want to chase
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day I'm going to get hit by a bus,
you know, and I'm not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bus just flies through the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that a line in a sublime song or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't remember most things off the top
of your head anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but I'm the second biggest
sublime fan in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second, the second.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't try to take number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, I feel like we've covered
curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else to add to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to mess up some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes practice and patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get it right the first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can do is go, you can open it too
often.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaving it closed too long will screw you
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go in there and open it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think maybe I need to open it,
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you have another jar next to
it, don't open that one and just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: compare, take notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way to become a good
grower and a good curer and dryer is to
[SPEAKER_02]: practice it and take notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thoughts on rehydrating dry
weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not a, I'm not sponsored by
this company, but the humidipacks,
[SPEAKER_02]: the humidipacks work great for rehydrating
your buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been wondering what they'd be like
for long term storage as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of people throw their herb
in a sea vault, which doesn't sponsor me
[SPEAKER_02]: either with a couple of humidipacks and
leave it for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the dried out herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put lettuce or orange peels in your
bags, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what I was getting at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make your stuff not taste right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't add flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will, but not the flavor you want
added.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be funky flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else was I, curing herb that you've
possibly purchased from someone,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just trying to help out
listeners here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've gotten herb that you don't
feel is dry enough, if you've got some
[SPEAKER_02]: patience, you can cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's sticky, you can leave it in the
jar and let it, let it kind of dry real
[SPEAKER_02]: slowly in the jar, leave it in there
overnight, open it up, check on it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning and leave it open for like 15
minutes and just repeat that every day
[SPEAKER_02]: until it's good or open it every six hours
and check on it if you're impatient.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brown paper sack, possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown paper sacks are great because they
kind of, I did this when I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think that they kind of make a
little bit of a flavor in my buds now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've also lost a nice amount of weed,
a whole brown paper sandwich bag to mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it sped up the mold process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of feel like they may absorb oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can time it right, it's a great
step between the hanging process and the
[SPEAKER_02]: jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that one, if you have to leave it out
for, if you've got to be away at work all
[SPEAKER_02]: day, but you know it should be in the jar,
but it's not dry enough for the jar,
[SPEAKER_02]: that bag is probably going to work for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a company ideal for someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come up with a brown paper sack that
doesn't have all those issues we just
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a canvas bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those vitamin cottage, the old vitamin
cottage shopping bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've cured urban nose before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it done in a five gallon bucket
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done and seen that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just prefer, I prefer the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it doesn't give me any flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're doing five gallon buckets,
try to find the good lids that have the
[SPEAKER_04]: rubber seals in them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And black buckets from the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your weed came in a turkey bag,
it was not dried and cured probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was possibly dried and stacked in a
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all of the others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before it got shipped off to wherever it's
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned this at the beginning of
the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I'm going to say that we've covered
the dry and curing for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any more questions,
specific questions, please send me those
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a listener that this episode was
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if she wants her name said on
the air, but she just recently emailed me
[SPEAKER_02]: saying she was excited because I told her
it was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said she was excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I missed anything for you, please let
me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, I want to make this work for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody needs to be a good dryer and
cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I skipped a whole bunch of grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing grow lessons on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got all the way through veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in like mid veg phase just before we
were going to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've jumped all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've harvested, we've done outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get back to the lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been trying to do what's current
and what's relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not trying to mess you up, throw you
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get back to the lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning of the show, I mentioned
that the city council meeting has been
[SPEAKER_02]: moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: City council first planned the meeting for
Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew it was a holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still wanted to meet, but they
changed their mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting will now be Tuesday at seven o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's city hall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at one city hall plaza.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said at the beginning of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, it's on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I better make sure, but go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, are you going to be there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm committing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little posse coming with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a posse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesdays are actually much better for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday was kind of hard or Monday was
kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tuesday was way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one city hall place, Tuesday at 7
PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to speak, you have to be there
about 630.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sign up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, if you're going to speak,
try to have some education about what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go in there and cuss them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give them the finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people yell at city council
before, trying to prove a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in there and try to be, if you've got a
suit and a jacket, wear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make some notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do it right, nobody will have to
speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do it right, a lot of us will show
up and we've got a spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know who I would rather have speak for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, get there first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go every week, get there, sign up,
speak our part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike knows exactly what to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we need a spokesperson, he'll sign
up and he definitely will speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully after he speaks, they just deny
the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're looking for hasn't even been
submitted to, or what they're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about hasn't been shown to them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to preempt this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll be like, oh shit, then maybe we
shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to mess with all 60 of us
sitting there at the city council meeting,
[SPEAKER_02]: telling them why it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just go, okay, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, sometimes, especially on a
Tuesday after a holiday, no one's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in the mood to sit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys come out, please come out and
support us at the city council.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado,

I.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

but I mean, that's some incentive.

[SPEAKER_02]: You can talk to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give me show ideas.

[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'm just too damn high for my
own good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See I'm too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even say appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you guys for listening
to the Cure Lesson.

please let us know because we're as dabbed
[SPEAKER_02]: out as you and we may have gone over
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of experienced and sometimes we
forget the small details.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still furiously trying to think of
something that we skipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they'll email me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Twitter will light up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be like, you missed this part,

[SPEAKER_02]: Also don't forget, I need somebody to go
and count how many times I said the F
[SPEAKER_02]: word.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I said it at all in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're making progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guests can say whatever they want
because I like you to be yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I got to be a good host and be a good
little boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that coupon code again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I?

hands plural.

[SPEAKER_02]: The popcorn is popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give it just a few weeks here and I'll
refill them and everybody will be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, join the forum at

[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to say iregeneticscolorado.com,
but the cotton mouth made my face stick
[SPEAKER_02]: together so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what even came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll just do this rap part of the
show while Jesse's sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I play some music and come back
and end it, but there's no reason to take
[SPEAKER_02]: a break because we're on a roll.

YouTube.

the better.
