[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Cowboy
Kush Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of H-A-O-G and Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
earthy, fuel, and leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spoken about this concentrate on the
show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly agree with those flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the buzz from the Cowboy Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell I'm trying to catch my
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dabs I took kind of took my breath
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also made me nice and chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just chilling in the chair right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are a little bit droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got terrible posture right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some concentrates make you nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one makes me super stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the container, it says that
this contains 64.88% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really enjoying the buzz, the flavor,
the aroma, and this concentrate was
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious and potent
[SPEAKER_00]: Cowboy Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
in this episode, I'm going to read a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of the folks who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still in a quarantine lockdown
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these joints, all of these bong
rips, all of these dabs are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: digital and virtual, and we will follow
safe social distancing guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get started by rolling up a big
fat joint and passing that digital joint
[SPEAKER_00]: over to my friend Country Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pack up a big giant digital bong
load for my buddy Ryan M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to roll a big fat cyber joint for
my buddy Adam Sloan.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we pack up a big fresh bowl of
JPEGs for my buddy Flava Maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big digital dab over to my
buddy Carlos B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we pack up a big fresh bowl of
MP3s and fire them up for my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're getting crazy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to have fun during a quarantine
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with me, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the fun going by rolling up a
big fat joint of JPEGs and MP3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put some gifts on the outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll sprinkle some Keef down the
middle of it just to get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fire that fucker up and
pass it over to my buddy Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a giant digital dab for my
buddy Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's roll up a big fat joint of MP3s,
sprinkle a couple of GIF files on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of that, and then let's pass that
fucker over to the hardest working man in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send that over to my buddy James
Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to take a big fat bong rip of
digital downloads and send that fucker
[SPEAKER_00]: over to my buddy Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then last but certainly not least,
how about a big digital hug, a high five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a giant giant dab for my buddy
Woodside1.
[SPEAKER_00]: 9-5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks, big shout out, big digital
dabs, big hypothetical social distance
[SPEAKER_00]: hugs to all of my friends and family who
continue to support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not supporting the show and you
would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and in the video description
[SPEAKER_00]: for my stoned friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, before we get to the
email portion of the show, I've got one
[SPEAKER_00]: more thing I'd like to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant congratulations to
all of my friends at the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows show recently hit their
1000th podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to have been on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to be friends with the whole
Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to be part of the Dude Grows
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows gang, the Dude Grows Army,
the Iry Army, the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast crew, and the Dude Grows crew is
all one gang in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be a part of that club,
a part of that gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all of my friends in
the Dude Grows crew and big
[SPEAKER_00]: congratulations, big high five,
big dabs, big joints to my friends at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows show for the 1000th episode
milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it means a lot when all of the
Dude Grows crew says congrats on a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand, but I'm a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fellow podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's like to get guests
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's like just trying to get a
co-host together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows crew does a very
professionally done show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got three dudes on the show that
are there most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least two of the three show up
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very hard to get that many stoners,
that many people with jobs and lives in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends from one
podcaster to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to get to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by the time I do that,
they will probably be around 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 1500 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so big shout out to my boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude, Scotty, Guru, everybody behind
the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the show and I'll be back up in
Fort Collins to be on the show as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: this quarantine stuff has ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'll get myself up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a four hour drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go up and see the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty, the Dude, Guru, I look forward to
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the point of the show where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to read listener generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a cannabis culture,
a cannabis cultivation question,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get your question on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have messaged me and they
said, dude, I've emailed you a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why hasn't my email been read?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be amazed and or overwhelmed at
the amount of emails I get every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some of your questions are
very urgent and very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm trying to get to all of them in a
timely manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to give each message the
time and energy and respect which it
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys rely on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just breezing through them,
I try to give a good answer for each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes me a minute, but I will get to
the messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus on a lot of emails for
the next few shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on the pile of emails in
today's episode goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I want to thank you for all of
the time and effort you put into the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast between the Dude,
Grow Show and Your Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gifted a tremendous amount of
education and I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude, Grow's crew and myself,
we are honored and we are excited to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great to hear that you have
gotten, you've been gifted a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad somebody realizes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for mentioning it and I
appreciate hearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have some, I read genetics
golden goat coming in the mail any day now
[SPEAKER_00]: and I couldn't be more excited to run your
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite strains and I've never
been able to grow it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for you to get that golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this message quite a while ago,
so you've probably got those seeds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick ass with the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is a golden goat podcast
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, anyway, my mind is
adrift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a fish lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question, I grew Holy Grail Kush
feminized seeds, which hermed on me in
[SPEAKER_00]: turn, which pollinated our neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapple chunk, which was also a
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Holy Grail Kush feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had pineapple chunk,
feminized seeds in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Holy Grail Kush in this room is
suspected of showing intersex traits or
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming a hermaphrodite and pollinating
the rest of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to assume you've got a room
filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says question number one,
will some of the seeds be feminized?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing no on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are probably correct, but I cannot
tell you for sure until you grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the pollen donor was a
hermaphroditic plant, that trait is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be at least 50% existent in your future
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds carry a hermaphroditic trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a good chance they will be
herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a good chance they will be
fems, but it is more likely you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow them out and you see any male
flowers come out of them, it's very likely
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got hermaphroditic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question is, so I've made an
accidental cross, I think, but will it be
[SPEAKER_00]: worth growing out the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the seeds from the Holy Grail,
which was so loaded with seeds I just made
[SPEAKER_00]: it into edibles, or grow out the pineapple
chunk seeds crossed to the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure this is even considered a
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like an accidental pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing you would want to give away
or share with anybody until you grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a hundred of those seeds each,
each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow the Holy Grail,
Holy Grail Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow the Holy Grail pineapple
chunk seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow all of them and see what
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them like you would any other plants,
but pay very close attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good notes on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good notes on the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay very close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any intersex traits or any
problems, get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have made gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have also made a bunch of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, since one of the
parents was a hermaphrodite, the future
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny is probably a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may, however, find a couple of real
gems in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't intend on selling them,
if you don't intend on profiting from
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you have some fun seeds to play
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow a few, see if they're worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the first few don't impress you,
you can abandon the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to keep it going,
but do not spread those shitty seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The responsibility as a cannabis breeder
is to improve the lines that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, not to make it shittier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to say, oh, I got these two plants
and I'm going to put them together and the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome will be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make it shittier, you're moving
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're time traveling backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making the whole race of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making it dumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got room, time and space,
grow a few of them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if they're worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them to the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several options that you could
do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can eat them if you're comfortable
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good hemp seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm going to grow them out for fun
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is what you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown these strains without ever
having a problem before, but I was
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering genetically, are they just going
to herm again or at least very likely?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened in that grow room this time
that was different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a light leak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you overwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you overfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you underwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you stress these plants out in
multiple ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: What went wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you know you've got a problem,
you need to investigate and diagnose that
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and figure out what caused that
plant to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it one in the corner that's near a
light leak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it one by a vent that's getting a
little bit light coming in from one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vents or the ducts or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to figure out why that plant
hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's got that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's in the genetic code.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just know that something unlocked it
and we don't know what that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as it was not unlocked again by
a light leak or something, you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would only do it one more time if it
herms again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it fucks up next time, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it one more chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gives you shit, it's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Kush genetics are prone to being
hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that is known in the old
school growing community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Kush stuff is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be just a really sensitive
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have done something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blaming you, but you could have
done something very easily with the feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the nutrients, with the spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being in there, you could have pissed
that plant off and just triggered that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to show its intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been growing it consistently
for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have everything dialed in, which
includes these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the herm was just a fluke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something caused it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fluke herm out of three years is not a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something caused that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a reaction to a cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you again for all that you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you around our beautiful
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will for sure say hello if I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: With love from Red Heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Red Heights, it sounds like you're a
Colorado person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to bump into each other as
soon as this quarantine situation is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can smoke a joint more than digitally.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, a big shout out to my friend
Red Heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you figure out what is causing that
Holy Grail Kush to go herm on you because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a great cross from some great
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to take a quick drink
and then we're going to move right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I would pause for a
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to hear it happen right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrate with me, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another email right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, oh, I don't think
they want their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says deep in prohibition land,
so let's not even say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are doing well, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am great so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for checking in on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not contributed to the podcast yet,
but I plan on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's all right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect everybody to contribute to
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I mention and talk about the
Patreon quite often, at least once,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe twice every episode, but I still
love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want you to be my friend and I
still want you to listen even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are able to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will help out for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot, keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is be the best grower
that you can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I ask of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that every time you walk into
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that whenever you walk out of
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that when you're sharing grow
knowledge and grow advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the best grower you can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never give bad advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never give untested, unsound advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never do stupid shit in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never be lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have a good attitude when you're in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never go in your garden thinking about,
this is going to yield two pounds and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make this much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never think about your wallet when you're
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having a hard time with
somebody, maybe if you're fighting with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody at work, maybe your boss yelled
at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're having a hard time with your
girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you had to discipline your kids and
you got some weird weight on your
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders or a weird feeling in your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take that into the grow room with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave that right outside the grow room
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in the grow room and let that be your
place of bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share that with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really important thing to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that for me and you don't have to
contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a good positive attitude in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a good positive attitude fucking
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let it start right there in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it grow right along with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then walk out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carry that cool vibe with you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it's all free also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't fucking cost anything and it's
very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused because I'm getting
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I did, however, order three packs
of iry genetic seeds recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes orangegasm, Raphael,
and my Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a great mix that is going to be
very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm growing in a three by three
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the timber grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not familiar, but I can read about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With four Vero 29S and my first grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with two regular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a three by three tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of fancy lights or four of one
kind of light and one fancy light in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first tent with two regular
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I will be using radical bags,
which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of folks that support the
radical bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the five gallon side with ocean forest
and nectar of the gods, nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use bamboo sticks in my first grow,
which worked well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may try a Scrog moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on moving the plants around,
use the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can live with having the plants
stuck in place, if you can get around that
[SPEAKER_00]: three by three tent to water very well,
if you can reach every pot, I recommend a
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Scrog will be much easier,
much more uniform and much safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the three by three, all you have to
do is strap it up to the corners in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to be watering,
feeding, defoliating, working time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can almost unwrap all of the tent
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the good tents are made where they
really unzip really far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got access to most,
probably three of the four sides of that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one sides up against the wall
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can usually access three full sides
in the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right, I would recommend the
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sticks are great, but they get
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll poke yourself in the eye with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break one of those bamboo sticks open one
time and see how much mold and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: much shit is inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be grossed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use sticks,
I recommend you throw them away after
[SPEAKER_00]: every grow or use the plastic coated metal
type garden sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more expensive,
but they are safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an investment upfront, but you don't
have to throw them away and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: cause problems in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should keep myself on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at this part using bamboo sticks in
my first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question about the number of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should try to grow in a three by three,
as I know your plants will grow with hyper
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious if I should start growing
one plant and give her some room or go for
[SPEAKER_00]: two and have them bump elbows,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only issues I had with my first grow
was heat, but I did go with the gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent this time and I have a nine foot
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think things will be slightly cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have a carbon filter with a six
inch infinity fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of cool things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that even if you've got a
carbon filter in the fan, wherever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dumping that heat, if it's going right
into the same bedroom, it will end up back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a recent episode on grow tent
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you check that one out also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've already heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the main question here is how many
five gallon pots should I run in a three
[SPEAKER_00]: by three tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got a couple of options and a
couple of things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were going to Scrog it,
I recommend somewhere between two and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe four five gallon pots in that small
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would use a Scrog net really close
to the plants to spread them out really
[SPEAKER_00]: wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them really wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're nice and spread out,
I would put another net above them and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them grow into that net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would work that net to fill the
entire canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the entire canopy was filled with a
nice, nice bushy hedge of branches and
[SPEAKER_00]: tops, that's when I would put a third net
above that and flip into flower and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them grow into that third net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would have three layers of net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have a spreader, then you would
have a Scrog stretcher, then you would
[SPEAKER_00]: have the support net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do somewhere between two and four
five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go deeper into some of those
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do one, it is going to take quite
some time to veg that one plant out long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to fill that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do two, you start filling the space
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to wait as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fill the space twice as
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do three, obviously you're reducing
veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do four, obviously you've cut down
veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tremendously, we can fill this space much
more quickly with more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are things to consider when it
comes to these plant numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants are you allowed to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can only have two, stay legal,
grow two, wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we start watering these five
gallon pots, we are introducing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: water into a three by three room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running five gallon radical bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many gallons of water does it take to
fully saturate a five gallon radical bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess you can pour a solid
gallon, maybe two gallons of water into
[SPEAKER_00]: that radical bag every two to three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you've got four of those in that
room, that is going to be approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: eight gallons of water poured into your
radical bags in a three by three growth
[SPEAKER_00]: center every two to three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to create a tremendous
amount of humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you've got the water you've already
poured into the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light in the room is going to heat up
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to create evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the water that is already in the
pots, then the plants are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: letting out water already on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to create more humidity in
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have to vent that room
and pay very close attention to your VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to defoliate heavily to slow
down that release of water and also to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent any kind of bud rot or powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a lot of moisture in
the air and that causes a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get the air out of that
room, I would do four pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't control the air and the
moisture, maybe reduce it to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can be patient and let it veg
really slowly, go for two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really worried about moisture,
which you shouldn't be, I'm making you
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoid, one or two plants will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three will be kind of pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, you're going to have to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get that air out of the bedroom
or whatever room you've got your tent in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, if you're just ducting
the air out of the tent into a spare
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom, it is going to go right back into
the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to adjust that climate somehow
with the equipment or cycle it through
[SPEAKER_00]: another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that air blend with room for another
bedroom, from the main part of the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the central air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get that humidity,
that old stagnant air balanced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we need air exchange to get fresh
CO2 to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I would recommend one plant if
you want to be really patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: two plants if you want to fill that scrog
up, three plants if you want to go at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and four plants if you really want to
fucking kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you can fit them in there and you
haven't already bought the pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe consider two seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're going to have a lot of
water and a lot of moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my thought process, almost
recommended reducing the pot size so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get a faster wet and dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still think we're going to be
pouring a lot of water into that room just
[SPEAKER_00]: more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is something you can consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have smaller pots, that is less
water, but you're going to have to water
[SPEAKER_00]: every day or every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pros and cons to the bigger pots
and the smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I like to water every
other day because I like a custom tailored
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to add boosts and do different
things every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a lot of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger pots, you only get to water them
once or twice a week, so you can only
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust your feed that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a problem, you want to make a
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watered Monday, you've probably got
to wait until Thursday to make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that change doesn't work,
you're probably waiting until Monday for
[SPEAKER_00]: your next water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm running smaller pots of cocoa,
I get to water every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say, oh, I should increase nitrogen,
that means tomorrow I get to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to wait until Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something I like, something to
think about, something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me derail your entire project
with crazy ideas and crazy grower talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your strategy is going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would probably do two or three five
gallon pots or two seven gallon pots if
[SPEAKER_00]: they would fit in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a lot of work and you want to
kind of struggle and make it a challenge,
[SPEAKER_00]: do four five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll keep you on your toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I just wanted to pick your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the nectar of the gods line does
have a six bottle sample pack they send
[SPEAKER_00]: out for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and he offered me a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have room to test a sample pack
right now, but maybe in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am stocked up on veg bloom and new mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a nice system and I'm afraid
to change it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says I've listened to a probably
100 plus of your podcast as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to my friends at
the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says from this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just call you deep right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, by the way, I don't think I
can make it to the DGC Cup this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I hope to meet you somewhere down the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you have found success in what you
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I look forward to meeting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a whole new opportunity of
meeting because the DGC Cup has been
[SPEAKER_00]: delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been postponed because of this
covid 19 bullshit that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are going to put it together and
make it happen as soon as we are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: congregate and have fun and smoke without
worry of getting each other sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me that you notice that I have found
success in what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the life that I've built for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing and thank you
for being excited that I have found the
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any cannabis
culture or cultivation questions again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to get that on the show as
soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
in a few weeks, I am going to be doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, 420 is slowly creeping up on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not feel like it because of this
social distancing, because of this virus
[SPEAKER_00]: lockdown and quarantine situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to celebrate 420 this
year with the quarantine situation with
[SPEAKER_00]: the lockdown environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to send me a message that
says you're going to ignore the rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke down and just have a party anyway,
don't bother messaging me because I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a positive response for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please practice safe social distancing
guidelines at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't like getting sick and
watching people around me die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our responsibility right now to take
care of ourselves and everyone else around
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be courteous, be polite, be thoughtful,
be mindful, protect yourself, protect
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough of a rant about the COVID-19
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to know is what are you going
to do to celebrate 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we gather at some event,
we gather in a park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go to a show of some sort,
be around other cannabis consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: like-minded folks, get stoned,
do the chatter thing, be social.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do something online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to skip it altogether?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just going to hang out by
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your special 420 plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know what you're doing for 420
and it better be social distance approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I may have a negative response you've
been warned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
that is all I've got for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening.
