[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of honey
banana full spectrum extract from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of banana OG and honey boo
boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
frosted banana pastry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first cracked the jar open,
the first aroma to hit my nose made me
[SPEAKER_00]: think of a banana liqueur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I've ever had a banana
liqueur, but that's what it smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost maybe a banana's foster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like it may have some ice cream
or something sweet to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I dab it, that liqueur
flavor, some of the sweetness goes away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that banana pastry is dominant in the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff made me sit down and chill the
fuck out for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 73.07% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the honey banana full
spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to focus on
Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of wonderful questions from

[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of wonderful messages from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first message today comes from our
friend Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Tonto?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have become good friends lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message says, Hey, feel free to call
me Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope this message finds you and
your heart in good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling pretty good today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can make it cooler somehow,
that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I got nothing to complain
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I was hoping to get your input on
how I should go about cleaning my flower
[SPEAKER_00]: area after pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a four by four organic soil living
bed with eight plants flowering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My veg mom cloning tent is a two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a lot going on, but I work
with the space my wife has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not a lot going on,
but I work with the space my wife has
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have much room to work with
currently, but I'm making it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's what growing is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also what being married is all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making it work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not frustrating the wife too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not denying you complete access to
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what being a good grower and being
a good spouse is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing exactly what you need to do,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, if you need a
picture, see my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shameless plug here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow our friend at Tonto's underscore
garden on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out his grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what he's got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I am just about
finished going through my first round
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in crossing or keeping for
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I read that as a weird rhythm,
but it says I'm just about finished going
[SPEAKER_00]: through my first round of seeds and
strains that I'm interested in crossing or
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, I was thinking
about reversing them one by one to
[SPEAKER_00]: self-pollinate and then also pollinate the
other strains I have in with it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: flower tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tonto basically wants to reverse a
plant and make some seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, how would you recommend I
clean my flowering area after to be sure
[SPEAKER_00]: no pollen is left over from the previous
run before starting the next cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does pollen go bad after a certain time if
left in an open environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of my growing journey that is
brand new, but it won't be starting until
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signs it with, thanks for all you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are greatly appreciated in the
cannabis community and source of joy to
[SPEAKER_00]: many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a source of joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people tell me that I'm
appreciated in the community, but to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: source of joy is a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure there's no more to read
and then we will take care from Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Tonto, let's talk about pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you are going to use
multiple males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to reverse a plant, make some
pollen, put that pollen on some females,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend having multiple males
in one run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do multiple, I would do different
runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be male A, do a crop with him,
finish it, clean up, harvest, then do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that may be your strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know how to get rid of the
pollen, how to ensure that the pollen will
[SPEAKER_00]: not stick around for future runs and cross
pollinate, cross contaminate the other
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, water will destroy pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have harvested, take down the
plants, empty out the room, just spray
[SPEAKER_00]: everything down with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put another cleaning product in
there if you choose to just clean the room
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of a sanitation product,
a sterilization product, maybe some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put hydrogen peroxide in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a product I'm really trying to
think of and it will not come to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of my head right now, but you can put that
Fizan 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I was trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put some Fizan 20 in there,
sterilize the room, clean up the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically water will deactivate the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've harvested the seeds,
you've got the room clean, there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in there, just go crazy with the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to spray everything, even the
equipment that probably shouldn't get that
[SPEAKER_00]: wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still mist it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unplug everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my mister as fine as it will go,
so I put just super mist everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mist it and then I'll do that just
every couple of days when the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put new plants in there, I'll just go
spray them with the foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm hitting them with the
foliar, I'll also just get the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the humidity real high,
get water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just want to destroy the pollen,
get it wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to clean the room
enough between crops, just in your basic
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting in there and scrubbing
things down, wiping everything down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably going to get rid of the
pollen just in that general cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often miss cleaning the tops of the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got square shaped lights,
if you don't have some lights around and
[SPEAKER_00]: they aren't shaped the right way to gather
stuff at the top, but some lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've got a Magnum XXL eight inch
fucking reflector, you've got a big bench
[SPEAKER_00]: up there, a big seating area for pollen
just to land up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you wipe all that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to look above your head,
wipe all that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any surface that may get dusty,
that dust is probably containing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is going to be what gets rid of
the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water will help you make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got other plants in the area
and you're pollinating plants over here
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are plants over here,
you don't want to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're going to be jostling
pollen around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the plants on the other side with
water and their pistols are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: deactivated when the water comes or when
the pollen comes, the pollen will hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants won't get pregnant on this
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate the plants on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on that as your only fail safe,
but that is another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's a little, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Birth control for your plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is the main way to deactivate
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water, water, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can just keep spraying water when
you're full of your feeding things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spray the room also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pesticide feeding or spraying,
spray the room also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put more water on the walls,
on the gear, then wipe everything down,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen usually, if it's left in that room
with all the temperature swings,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity spikes, all the activity,
all the light, all the darkness,
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen will probably deactivate
itself in 60 to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could survive longer if the conditions
are right, but you're getting light and
[SPEAKER_00]: cold or light and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting hot and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the temperatures are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen that's free and loose is going
to degrade and deactivate quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tonto, I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rambled on quite a bit about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is the key to deactivating pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've got another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call themselves Max, Scrim,
and Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a joke in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get, but what up Max, Scrim,
and Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes, hey man, new Patreon
member here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, first off, I love the show and I
have talked to you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Max, Scrim, and Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you can refer to us as Max,
Scrim, and Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question for you is the herbs
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just purchased one and I want to know
what you think about using that as the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing part of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't work this hard for months to
create good product and then ruin it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the final steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for what you do for the
community, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love from your homie, Max,
Scrim, and Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so what this listener is asking
about is a product called The Herbs Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a drying and curing rack that is for
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it advertised in a couple of
grow magazines and grow geared outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is kind of modeled after a food
dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing looks just like a food
dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a setting on the front that you
set it to the setting you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that it comes pre-programmed to
dry your herb to 15% moisture within 96
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the math on that, 96 divided by
24, that's four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that your herb will be dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like it dry that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that it is the perfect
temperature and the perfect humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see some herb that came
from that and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a nice, slow dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, if I hang my plants,
they can be dry in about five to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: days, but I do things to make them dry
more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think during the drying and curing
process, a lot of chemical reactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very important for quality buds happen
in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get too far into that,
but I think that a longer, slower dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: cure makes for a better finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing seems like a fast track to
speeding things up, and that doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: like the way to go for drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the science behind the device,
just the way that they designed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the science, the theory, in theory,
it looks like it would really work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen one in person,
but I feel skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to come on my show where a
lot of people listen and say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing doesn't look like it would do
what you're thinking it's going to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it could, it could not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am scared of it because I want my buds
to dry more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I did think about is if
you're in like Florida or somewhere where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's real sticky and you've got a lot of
humidity, a lot of moisture, and it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: too long for your buds to dry,
this may be a good device for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to slow down the drying of my
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want five or seven, maybe 10,
maybe even 12 days of drying time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing says 96 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb that I've had that dried too fast,
too quickly, never tasted the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wished it would taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herb that took a little bit longer
always tasted better in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without having touched the product,
without having smoked any of the product
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out of this device, I can't give
you like a real definite answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it could go either way to
tell you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it is the product for me,
but I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you're in a high humidity
environment, if you're if you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that product dried and cured out of
there, that may be the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been not hitting your dry and
cure goals, if you're not getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in properly, this may help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're completely ruining your product
at the end and you're not happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: this could be the rescuer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already sucking, this may
improve it, but I think old school drying
[SPEAKER_00]: and curing is basically free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to buy too much equipment
for a small grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a humidifier and a
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying that much gear,
that may be when it comes to looking into
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without seeing it, without touching
it, I can't give you a real honest
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I did have more info for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you bought one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run it, see what it does, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry some of your herb the way you used to,
and then dry some of your herb in this
[SPEAKER_00]: machine and compare, see what you like
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then give me some feedback and we can
talk about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving because I do have a
nice stack of Patreon messages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says CBD trichome question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I took a screenshot of this one
because when I tried to print the message,
[SPEAKER_00]: it did not print.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to scroll through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Papa Z and
it says, what up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, your show has helped me and
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure beyond words.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it is an honor to have a black
belt grower such as yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I consider you my mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, I am eternally grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am all of your mentor and I appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support and the kind
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I get back way more than I give
through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you give and that is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to contribute to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the show out for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is greatly appreciated that you
contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, I'm also a fellow
drummer of 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your wrists feel okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been drumming for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knees are starting to hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wrists feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's from bashing on shit for way
too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep keeping time, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the message goes on to say cannabis,
drums and family are my loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we get along, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing a critical mass one to one
auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a, it's got a one to one ratio
of CBD to THC is what was advertised on
[SPEAKER_00]: the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't tested the product because it is
still growing, but that is what is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: expected from the phenotype based on
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says August 5th will be eight weeks
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just started flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got an eight or nine week plant,
maybe a nine or 10 week plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just begun the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, does the 30% amber trichome
guideline apply the same to CBD rich
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as straight THC plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much love from Papa Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, what would I have to do to
get a grow from your heart sticker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no grow from your heart podcast
stickers available yet, but it is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: time for me to place an order with my
sticker maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may include the GFYH logo in that
sticker print.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that one goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I make stickers, I'll keep you
posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you a sticker because you support me
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get that one to one CBD
to THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a CBD expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know me, I want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think going up makes me feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD makes me feel I lose dexterity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were playing, I don't play video
games.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't play guitar, but if I were to try
to play guitar, I do kind of fiddle on a
[SPEAKER_00]: guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my thing, but I've got one and I
dick around on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I smoke a CBD product and try to
dick around on the guitar, my fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't as dexterous as they would be had I
not consumed this CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little rubbery, a little
Gumby-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have the full control like I
feel like I normally would had I not
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not a CBD expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't breed CBD, but I would like to
assume that you're still going to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: amber trichome, 30% amber trichome
guideline, because we still want ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're ripe when they're that
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which cannabinoid they are
ripe with, but it feels like that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want fruits when they're ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can identify when they're ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still want our cannabis ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that trichome color is
still the way to determine that even
[SPEAKER_00]: though we're going after the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had better input for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sending your thinking of different
ways to think of this, but I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go by those trichomes just like you
normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink and we're
going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even thought about it while I was
drinking and I want you to continue by
[SPEAKER_00]: following that 30% amber trichome rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are any CBD farmers out there
who have better guidance for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll feed you back with that info
as it comes into me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Papa Z, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to getting replies
from my audience to help you out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Willie's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name pop up a lot on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you a shout out a lot at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really cool, unique name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad to get your message on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, a message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hello Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally made it back to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're here, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys don't ever sweat or stress
that you can't help out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of people that do help
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I pitch Patreon a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like you can't listen or that I
don't like you as much because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat everyone as equals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon does help get your emails to the
top of the list, but I do read other
[SPEAKER_00]: messages that don't come from Patreon,
but I promise these people to get read as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next recording session from the time I
get your Patreon question, I try to put
[SPEAKER_00]: you on the next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry if you can't support Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want you to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people out there that are
supporting it to keep it going,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do is you can grow the best
cannabis you know how to grow when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pays me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your grow the best you can make me
proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means more than money to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow your best herb you can make me
proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get back into this message
because that honey banana got me fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message says, I just recently started
your veg bloom and new millennium nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen back a few episodes,
a lot of episodes, I do a full description
[SPEAKER_00]: of my nutrient mix and I use new
millennium bottled nutrients and veg bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: powder nutrients in different facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use one as a base and different
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the other in some facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mixing them and making a turbo
nutrient mix here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy goes on to say, Willie's armpit
goes on to say, I'm four weeks into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have never seen my plants healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure my friends at veg bloom and my
friends at new millennium hearing love
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my garden has never looked so
happy as it does now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hooked on Bodhi seeds for years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi makes a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Bodhi, but I'm definitely switching
to iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's no need to switch up to iry
if Bodhi is making you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're loving what's coming out of your
garden, when you're growing Bodhi seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep growing Bodhi seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi is a great dude, a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: No reason to switch it up unless that is
something you're choosing to do on your
[SPEAKER_00]: own, just to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I promote Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi is a great dude, breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, nothing wrong with growing
Bodhi's gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wonderful strains come out of Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, I can show my love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, now I can show my love and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has ever done for my garden what
you have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could pledge more to Patreon
because you are definitely worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Willy's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hearing how ecstatic and delighted
you are with your garden from my advice is
[SPEAKER_00]: payment enough, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress that you can't help me out
more on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were doing what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just told me that your garden looks
better from the time I put in behind this
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I had to do was come here and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes a little bit of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some toys, got some technology
happening, some prep work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, I sat here and spoke into
this microphone and your garden looks
[SPEAKER_00]: better because you took that info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means enough to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to give me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep kicking ass in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep growing the best product you can grow
and you'll pay me back every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Willy's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm glad your garden looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions about the
veg bloom and new millennium mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one did not come from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I told you that I read messages that
don't only come from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by the end of this episode and the
next one, I'll be caught up on Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: messages unless we get a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I wanted to run a question across you to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you had any ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am the guy to answer this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have a 10 pack of seeds from a
breeder back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say the seeds or the
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep that out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is I started three and rapid rooters
like I always do and a tray with dome and
[SPEAKER_00]: a tray with the dome under T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature is 76 and the humidity is
62%.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple of days, the seeds
developed fuzz on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cleaned them off and put them in soil
so far after a week on sprouting and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in soil so far after a week of
sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say that we're supposed to
say of sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person started off some seeds,
10 of them, and they put them in rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooters the way that they normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put them in a tray with a dome under
T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like a dome for my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the dome for clones to keep the
humidity in there because they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to feed from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings, they don't need as much
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it makes them weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to take them off the dome and
introduce them to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever give them a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't start off being babied and
pampered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it gives them a little bit of a
boost, a little bit more strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you're doing it, if it works for
you, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying I don't do the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says temperature 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go a little bit warmer, but they're
going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is 62.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple of days, the seeds
developed fuzz on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a couple of things,
but I want to keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had this problem before with
this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen that some people use Dr. Zymes
before putting seeds into the router.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this help or are the seeds just bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use this question on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for everything you do and
dropping free knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've done this before and
you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But possibly, I'm not blaming you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly that rapid router, that moist
rapid router, that seed, that dome,
[SPEAKER_00]: that heat, that environment, that could
have caused a little bit of that cobweb,
[SPEAKER_00]: spiderweb looking white mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have caused that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blaming you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just listing options.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been the moisture in the
rapid router being stuck in the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have set up the perfect
environment for that mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other option is maybe, and this is why
I didn't say the breeder of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible that those seeds came from
plants that had powdery mildew in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just had mildew on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there was some sort of a pathogen in
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when those seeds were harvested,
maybe they were not allowed to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: properly before they were put into a
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were still moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were put into a package.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of mildew developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you seal up moisture and you give
it a little bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to give you mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three ways that that mildew
could have happened in your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have gotten it in the rapid
router.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have happened in the plants while
they were growing, or it could have
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a grower, when you breed seeds,
it's a lot like having a wet herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have a bunch of wet herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it dry enough to take the seeds
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds still have moisture in them and
on them sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a big hurry, you're just a
commercial producer trying to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe, you package them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't give them enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still a little bit moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what happened,
but those are the three things that come
[SPEAKER_00]: to my mind when I try to think about why
your little seedlings may have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you ask, people use Dr. Zymes before
putting the seeds into the router.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that help?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have helped depending on what
that pathogen was on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, possibly, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen people put a little bit of
hydrogen peroxide in the water to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have been an option for you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we spoke a little bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've already found a solution
for your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I solved your problem or at least
gave you a little bit of insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you want your name set on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not include it here in the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name pop up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you in the Instagram feed all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Yo, Rasta Jeff,
I love the show and the in-depth answers
[SPEAKER_00]: you give to each question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't like the in-depth
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rambly a little bit, but I'm glad
you enjoy the in-depth answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it really shows how much
preparation goes into each response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down a few notes on each email and
then I try to keep it spontaneous and go
[SPEAKER_00]: from the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode, a couple of shows back
where I took way too many notes and it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't feel natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the show's flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to just make a couple of bullet
points and keep it going, keep it flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally, keep it conversational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather talk with you than to you or at
you, I think is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me continue because I'm doing that
thing where I ramble again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I'm watching a short video on
terpenes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me think of your comment on a
recent episode about limonene coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have your lights closer to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have said before that I believe we
can bring out the limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lemon flavored plant and
you want it to be even more lemony,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it a little bit too close to the light
late in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what it does,
but the plant goes, shit, it's way too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to create this thing and it
makes limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the plant thinks it's
going to do, but it does that and it
[SPEAKER_00]: creates limonene and we harvest those
plants and they taste fucking lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a sour diesel plant that grew way
too close to the light and it tastes like
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what made me start thinking
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I noticed those plants that got too
close to the light always have that sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeter sort of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get back into this
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, this video is saying that the
plant can put out different terpenes at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top where it is more prone to insects,
including limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom, it may put out more bitter
terpenes to keep grazing mammals away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows that you are onto something
with your theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about like grazing animals,
anything from like a chicken to a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: pig or a cow, anything that would come
around and eat the bottom of a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes it taste bitter so that that cow
goes chomp, chomp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it walks away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up at the top, you're going to get
completely different attackers,
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be up there at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes that limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the spider mites go up there,
they go, this is sour, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that you gave me some feedback
and I love that I've got some scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: support here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, keep putting out that
great content from the Smokin' Cascogin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, PS, the video is
Terpenes in Marijuana Explained with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake Felice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody else out there would like
some supplemental terpene education,
[SPEAKER_00]: check out Terpenes in Marijuana Explained
by Dr. Jake Felice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I may be watching that
video when I'm done recording here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Smokin' Cascogin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that somebody out there
supported some of my wild cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going for a minute, but I've got
one more message that I want to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, what's happened in Rasta
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to reach out and give you a
follow-up to a question you read on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast regarding an M.
[SPEAKER_00]: dog hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did chop her down at week six and you
were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was loaded with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember saying that if you can see a
few seeds on the outside of that bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is probably loaded up on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was loaded with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also seeded a swamp boys shocky
plant I had near her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a rough sentence, but we got
through it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run that M.
[SPEAKER_00]: dog perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I wanted to discuss this
with you is I feel that I have experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a podcast about genetic drift
and briefly, no, that's not what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can explain genetic drift again,
but that is not what genetic drift is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know you've discussed this in a
couple of episodes and I feel I have
[SPEAKER_00]: explained this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stated the M.
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, I started the M.
[SPEAKER_00]: dog back in April of 2019 and I've been
cloning her before I sent her into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not cloning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're cutting a clone, letting it veg,
cutting clones from that, then putting
[SPEAKER_00]: that big plant into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically how we keep a plan
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to doing a mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just flower out that mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so she's running for a little
over a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had that one hermy that I sent you
the question on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the following two plants also hermed
on the same spots, the lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run organics and I didn't have any light
leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking this was genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough data on your grow to
have a solid opinion, but I think that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has always been a herm and you are
just now giving it the proper conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: to express that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that is my assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't tend to just become herm that
doesn't, and I don't think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're just now giving it the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The situation, whatever, there's something
that is triggering it to herm that it
[SPEAKER_00]: never had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is different now that wasn't
different before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the soil a little bit hotter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the soil weaker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your feed more rich?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the room more humid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be any number of factors
deciding, making this plant decide that
[SPEAKER_00]: now I want to be a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, do you think cloning over and
over again for a year caused her to just
[SPEAKER_00]: say, fuck this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really curious to see what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Patreon as Buzzards Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Buzzards Bay, thank you for the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't have a definitive answer
other than I think that you just finally
[SPEAKER_00]: gave this plant the environment to
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been running it for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many crops you've had
before that, but I'm going to assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time you ran it, it's like a
first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you go out, first time you
ran this plant, first time you took this
[SPEAKER_00]: girl out, you were real polite,
real gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You followed the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You read all the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did the cool guy, kind guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polite guy move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did all that shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant was happy with you and it put
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time you got cocky,
you're like, it put out the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch me this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were kind of a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you're a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying this is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got too comfortable with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't open the car door right after
dinner when you're walking that plant out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the car after you ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time you opened the car door,
made sure she was in there comfortably,
[SPEAKER_00]: made sure that her dress wasn't hanging
out of the car door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tucked her dress in, closed the door
nice and gently, farted while you were out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the car, ran around the car,
got to your door, made sure the fart smell
[SPEAKER_00]: was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time you went on the date,
you guys, after dinner, you just fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: opened your own car door and jumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You farted in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens to guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go real careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We follow the book the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second time we get kind of cocky and
we forget that there's a lot of steps and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that maybe the first time
you were real, real careful with this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, she's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes this long to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to learn her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to figure her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time you may have taken it for
granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said she put out real well the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back for more of that the second
time, but you didn't take all the steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get it to put out the way you expected
it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the most crass description
I've ever given on a podcast, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you understood exactly what the fuck I
meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that that plant was
probably a hermaphrodite the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were just now giving it the
opportunity to show you that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buzzards Bay.
