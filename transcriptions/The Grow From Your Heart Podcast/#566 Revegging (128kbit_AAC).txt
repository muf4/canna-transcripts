[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 566 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, let's send a big thank you
shout out to my friend, Jostafari,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the awesome intro track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that reggae air horn fits the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beautifully, great way to kick off the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I start the podcast off by talking
about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of banana
fosters, full spectrum extract from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Banana OG and Paris Larry on the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as banana,
sugar, and oatmeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really enjoy this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only bad thing about this concentrate
is I've only got one fat dab left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull this little crystal here out
of the container and show you this fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only dab that I've got left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saving this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably going to be a special
occasion dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the occasion may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 710 on Friday, something weird like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only dab I've got left of
the bananas fosters, full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been loving this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously got me nice and rambly,
nice and stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says it
does contain 84.43% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Green Dot Labs for the
delicious and herpy and potent bananas
[SPEAKER_00]: foster, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I caught my rhythm for this
podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's jump into the main topic
of today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say when you grow a plant for the
first time, make sure you take a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes you grow that plant and
you realize it is the best shit you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever grown and you really wish you could
grow it again, but you don't have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always say take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you fall in love with that
seedling?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you fall in love with that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are, seeds are, they show
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's phenotypical variation in a
package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chances of getting the exact same
phenotype again from a seed, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding, could be rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a huge outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be like that was the most potent or
the most medicinal or most relieving
[SPEAKER_00]: strain I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't take a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones died.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cat ate the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clone dough melted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something weird went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You roasted the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is our next solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always take a clone in flower if
you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too late for that, there's one
more option and that is re-veggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a plant that I didn't think I
wanted to run anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now guess what I am doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been re-veggied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is spitting out re-veg shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll catch you up with where I am in that
project here in the end of the episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's talk about re-vegging our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose is to preserve these
genetics, to rejuvenate this plant so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can rerun this plant and put it back in
our arsenal, our stable, our library to
[SPEAKER_00]: have this plant around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we flowered it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to re-veggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's how the re-veggie happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I re-veggie, it happens at
the end of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in control of the flowering
phase of this garden, you are now also in
[SPEAKER_00]: control of early re-veggie process.
[SPEAKER_00]: During flush time, I usually do this about
10 days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I'm running an awkward
light schedule at the end of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase anyway, but I'm going to talk about
that very briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will turn my lights to 18-6 for the last
10 or 14 days of flowering, and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up the flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get bigger, fatter, bulkier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two weeks flush time,
my lights are on 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're getting more energy,
but I'm going to cut them down before they
[SPEAKER_00]: show me any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I do not cut them down and I leave
them on that 18-6 light cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I let them go for more than two weeks,
I will start to see signs of re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking to re-veg the plants,
about 10 days before harvest, about flush
[SPEAKER_00]: time, put that light back on 18-6 or 24
hours of full light.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18-6 will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours will work even more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got 10 days before harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn the light cycle on 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's flush as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just be feeding water to the
plants, just nothing but water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flush time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to clean out the whole root
area, get it nice and clean, make those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants taste nice and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to flush like normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add any thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say this, flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to harvest these plants,
but we're going to do a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different technique than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to harvest most of the up top
parts of the plants toward the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave a couple of little
buds, just thumb size nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got the main stock of the branch,
main stock of the plant coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It branches off a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to cut off the main tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottoms, the bottom thumb size buds
leave four or five maybe six of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are going to become our new
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be the new shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what is going to re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have harvested and we've left
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I've got to clear the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've harvested and we've left a few
little nuggets on the bottom that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be our new vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are going to continue to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave the lights on 18-6 or
24.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got those little tiny nuggets there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest has been removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being harvested, dried, cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked and enjoyed, processed just like
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we've got this pot, your three or
five gallon, seven, whatever size pot
[SPEAKER_00]: you've used with just this little Charlie
Brown Christmas tree looking piece of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: plant sticking out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really sad, but it's been in a
re-veg state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been being told, Hey, I need you to
re-veg for 10 to 14 days by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's already going, Hey, that light's
been on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what we need to do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm supposed to flower
anymore because that's what I do when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm supposed to do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts thinking, maybe I'll go back
into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing the tops of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get new little growth coming out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: New, fresh little growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually that growth will turn into new
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to make new tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will happen slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I mentioned pot sizes a moment ago,
I realized I should talk about one more
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have been in these pots for
at least 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess you've got a nine week
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably had them in there for at
least four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And veg in these pots, maybe two,
if you're really thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in there for 11 weeks,
maybe 12 weeks or longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need to be up potted into a
larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can carefully and methodically
repot these pots, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you may cause more harm than
good, don't do it, but they're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opening up that root zone, giving them
some room to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let them know my shoes aren't too
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will continue to re-veg, but that's
not a major issue if you think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to fuck the plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big root zone is going to sustain
that small plant very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll focus more on the energy up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can up pot it, do that,
but don't, don't put yourself at risk
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the plant's going to start making
these little tiny, just nuggety type
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots coming out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, they're going to look
like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look really ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost look like dill or some sort of
spice or something that you would find
[SPEAKER_00]: floating on the top of a fancy soup that
you're not supposed to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there for flavor and decoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like cannabis for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take probably 25 to 45 days,
depending on the genetics, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights, depending on the nutrients,
depending on the environment, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many things, the root boundness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's even a word of that plant,
a lot of things will determine how quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant turns around.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is based on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got multiple plants in one room that
are being re-veged and I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: different behaviors from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can really tell you is that
the age and size of the plant will heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the way it re-veges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody gave me a bud from a flowering
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I want you to rescue this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought me a bud from a flowering
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really tiny one re-veged much more
quickly than a couple of bigger plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I pulled out of a flower room and
thought, shit, I don't have a happy clone
[SPEAKER_00]: of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't need to flower them this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pull those out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm re-vegging those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also re-vegging one that was damn near
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing a lot of different results from
plants that are in different phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're re-vegging at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the smaller ones going quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that was only into flower for
about two weeks before I decided to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another trick that happened to
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a plant in flower for 18 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it produced enough pistols to be
pollinated, I pollinated it and then I put
[SPEAKER_00]: it back in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got that plant re-vegging with
seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only took me 18 days to pollinate that
plant and I've got seeds out of that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled a couple of seeds out of it the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you what the cross
was, but that was my new experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I vegged it until it was about probably
12, 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flowered for 18 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit it with pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I knew the pollination was
successful, I pulled that plant out,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it back into a bedroom because I don't
have a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got that plant back in veg and it
has now crossed to a rise in seed form and
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds have been pulled out of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some of the weird shit that I'm
pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant re-vegged quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as quickly as the other one,
but then the one that is nine weeks into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and I decided to re-veg that,
that one took a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They re-veg at different stages,
at different phases based on where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to catch up on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a quick glance at the notes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start making leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are going to look ugly and
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, those leaves, more growth will
start coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will start getting actual shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, those shoots will quit
spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, they're going to spin and
they're going to look like claws and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to look like weird twisty
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to freak out for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not supposed to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this happened, if the plant survived
this long outside, it would just die and
[SPEAKER_00]: fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature would destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have hermed out by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have made a bunch of seeds,
but don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to hermit by doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nature thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to coil up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to spin around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, those leaves will begin to
look like normal leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, hey, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top will come out and it'll peak out
and those leaves won't look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, oh, it's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it plenty of time for those shoots to
stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those to get, I like them about
eight inches long with really good,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy looking leaves at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may take, like I said, 25 to 45 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it take 60 days on some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those shoots to come out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually they will correct and they'll
start looking like you're growing clones
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the top of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look, you've got those branches
coming up with five little thumb size
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets, maybe six thumb size nuggets out
of the top of that is a branch or a little
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot with perfect leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little palm tree,
a perfect little clone growing out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it and you'll be very proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you're going to want to
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brand new shoot that's growing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to wait until I can see three or
four of those happening and I will take
[SPEAKER_00]: half of them and I will clone half of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I take half of them, I'm mostly
confident that my clones are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: root, but obviously I've got a revenge for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably fucked up the clones the first
time or didn't think about it or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to clone half of them and I'm
going to let that plant keep growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: let the other half keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got more backup clones over
there in case shit happens again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't get it that next time,
then you're just shit out of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were not meant to have that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to take the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow those clones out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let them root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let them get big enough to
take, to take clones from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to flower out these plants
that were revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a clone off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to make shoots and make more
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a clone off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that one be my new flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by then the genetics and everybody
are way back to normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's in any shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It forgot all about that and it's just
making plants like before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to make funky looking
twisted leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll make normal shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to clone those normal shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that clone, pot it, let it grow until
it is big enough to take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take clones from that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is now your new donor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take clones from that and flower out those
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way I think you should do a
revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that is a very simplified method of
revenge, but I have taught myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many steps causes too many problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many moving parts causes too many
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the main keys, one of the main
tricks to speeding this up is to turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights back to 18.6 before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really speed this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot do that, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you harvest, cut down those
plants, clean up the room, get the part
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need out of there, get the part
you're going to harvest out, go trim it
[SPEAKER_00]: up, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put that plant back on 18.6,
put that room back on 24 hours a day if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, then get those plants back under
a veg cycle, start feeding them microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: and a good strong veg diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give them a lot of nitrogen and
a lot of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will get them going back in a good
vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to start shooting out
those shoots, get those clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: then just let them, let the clones veg,
then take clones of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a long, timely process,
but it is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something I really wanted to
talk about in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently reveged a plant that was fully
flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a plant that was filled with
seeds and I decided to revege that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shooting fresh tops off of the main
top and a couple of fresh tops off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of freshies coming up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is that top cola is
getting more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going, I'll revege like a
motherfucker up here where the light's
[SPEAKER_00]: super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super bright down a little lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting as much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not reveging as quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make another note because there's
something else I want to touch on that I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even write down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are vegging the top really
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and took a clone from that main
top piece that was growing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few backups down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I kill this one up top, I know we
got like four or five more clones down at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I topped, I chopped that first clone
out of the top, put it in the cloner and
[SPEAKER_00]: waited a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep checking for roots every few
days because I've got that grower OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I keep looking at the plants
where I took the clones from every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm noticing that since I took that
clone out of that reveged plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: those lower fresh growth tops have started
taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have effectively done the same thing
that we do when we top a plant before we
[SPEAKER_00]: flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken out its main apical dominant
top and the plant is going, Hey guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a top now somebody else gets
to be the new king.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to reallocate all those
hormones to the subsequent tops to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them the new dominant top, but they're all
about the same height in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all growing evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really sped up the growth of the
clones that I left behind in that revege
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're struggling, if you can't get
a couple of clones to pop up off of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as, and don't go too early because
that'll fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as you got one that's like
eight inches long, six or eight inches
[SPEAKER_00]: long, you can get a good, solid clone off
of it, take that main top one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the others will really start
going more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that is what I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a clone off of that plant that
is filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take the main top off of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now put that in a bin and let it dry so
that we can make seeds out of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will let the lower part of that
plant continue to veg and it's reveging
[SPEAKER_00]: and giving me more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll definitely have that genetic
secured, kind of regret letting that one
[SPEAKER_00]: almost slip away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I've secured a freshy clone of
that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to let you guys know what
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's probably typing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cross was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do this with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want to know what the one
that I veged and then fly, I veged to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we flowered it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this big and not everybody's
watching on a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've flowered it out at 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it go for 18 days, pollinated that
bad bitch, let it rest for a day in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room, then put it back into a veg
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reverted to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a plant with seeds on the bottom and
fresh growth on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people are going to get to
see something like that in their lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have one more note that I
want to talk about when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed, this is just in my
experience, that the plants underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs were slower to revege than the plants
underneath an HPS light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, this is a but, the growth that came
off of the LED lights looked healthier a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reveged more quickly and more
heartily under the LEDs or under the HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, totally let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they looked a little pale and a little
spindly and a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones under the LEDs took longer to
show the progress of revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they did it, they looked happier
and less stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just another thing that I
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened more quickly under the HPS,
but they looked less angry about it
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just in my experience,
that is what I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, this was a short,
sweet episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is already starting to burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to apologize for coughing and
fucking clearing my throat through this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's blame that on the bananas foster
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long day, but I enjoy coming

[SPEAKER_00]: I take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get pretty blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually cut me off after an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time they let me go for two full
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out, I answer cannabis cultivation
questions, cannabis culture questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple of dabs, you never know
what could happen because people type
[SPEAKER_00]: things in randomly in the live chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just field questions in the chat,
do my best to answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a stump the grower or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do my best to answer all the
questions on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no preparation.
