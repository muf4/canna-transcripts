[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all the official business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one more thing I do have to remind
you guys of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an update is what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: On episode number 126, we're talking about
the organization that was passing out
[SPEAKER_00]: joints to people who collected trash in
the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made a comment about how it was not
cool that they were giving out joints in
[SPEAKER_00]: the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been corrected, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Lindsey and Chris for
correcting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were listening to the podcast and
they were like, hey dude, they did not
[SPEAKER_00]: give the joints out in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did an article where people collect
the trash in the park and they cleaned up
[SPEAKER_00]: the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after they picked up the trash,
they got a free joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was under my assumption they got the
joint at the park because the news kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: made it look that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that they got a coupon and they
had to take the coupon to the Smoke Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Smoke Club then gave them a joint
when they presented proper ID and that
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a correction had to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not give the joints out at the
park.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it correctly, so shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also shout out to my friends for
correcting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I hope everybody had a great
week because I am recording on a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I record on a Thursday,
but this week was chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week on Thursday, I had a medical
marijuana doctor at 930 in the morning in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I worked all day and then I went to
the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secret sesh was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost forgot part of my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got up, I drove to Colorado Springs and
then I got stuck in a fucking elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've never been stuck in an elevator
before, but Thursday morning it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stuck in an elevator with two
strings of strangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't in there for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit freaky, but I didn't
panic or anything because I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just in an elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: People know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to get me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the people in the elevator was a
couple and the older dude was getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit pissed off that he was stuck in
an elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for him to be mad,
but I think just the simple idea that he
[SPEAKER_00]: was stuck pissed him off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to the medical marijuana
doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no stairs at this building,
oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got in the elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I held the door for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit floor three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went, and then it stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the dude and I was like,
I don't know that I want to be in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I think we're stuck in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, if it stops, and then it stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first instinct was trying to pull the
door open just to see where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far up did we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far down did we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the fuck we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried to pull the door open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good and stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little alarm button on the
elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a button that says call for
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple seconds later, a young lady
answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, did I just call the front desk
or what the fuck just happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, I'm stuck in the
elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked if I was at the address where I
was and I confirmed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, okay, hang tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll send someone to get you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, that's kind of just
basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask if we're okay or some shit.
Jeez.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat in the elevator for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another person, I kept hitting the
little alarm button.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just go jingle, jingle,
jingle so that somebody would know I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another person came and they're like,
hey, are you stuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yes, we're stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just started pushing buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which button because I wasn't
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she pushed the button, I could feel
the elevator shift a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I saw through the crack in the door,
I could see that we were only six or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: inches up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd only moved half a foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, keep doing that because we
were going down every time she did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I saw the little threshold piece
where the elevator would fit into the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want her to squish my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stuck my fingers in there and I totally
just pulled the door open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to slide the door open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once she got it a little bit lower,
we were a little bit late for our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana doctor appointment, but what can
you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I called them and I said, hey,
I'm stuck in the elevator, so please don't
[SPEAKER_00]: screw up my appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my medical marijuana
doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I should say his name on the
air because he's crowded already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know my medical marijuana doctor,
you give him a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a quick, easy appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got everything handled the way that I
needed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out of the elevator and went to the
doctor, saw the doctor, went and took care
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gardens all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to John Randall's Jr. Big
shout out to Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a huge shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody kicked ass in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you guys, I got to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I went to the dispensary and bought a
bunch of TURPEX shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to TURPEX.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new packaging is dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Lemon G, I might've grown that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Lemon G live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was fire, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I went and got some hash and then
I headed up to Denver where I went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: secret sesh and I met up with our buddy,
John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I want to give a shout out
to everybody that I got to dab with at the
[SPEAKER_00]: secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed with so many people that I'm not
even going to say one name because I will
[SPEAKER_00]: forget somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were at secret sesh and we took
a dab, much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dabbing and Adam Mills said,
I'm higher than everybody here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of pretty sure that I was
higher than him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, no, you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he saw me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, Ross and Jeff, I see you shaking
your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called me up to the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: His buddy Tim gave me, and that was at
least a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I took a gram and a half dab on
the stage at the secret sesh in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody and did not choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we brought up a couple of people
on the stage and dabbed them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a pretty good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I was lit up because I would
give people like a two gram dab and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they couldn't take, I would
finish it for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes it was most of a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to dab somebody a two gram dab and
they start choking and they look at you
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would just grab it and finish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pretty lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a little break and went and sat in
the green room and I ate a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheetos, drank some Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't eat a bunch of crap,
but I needed some crap in my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ate a bunch of junk and got my shit
back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was sitting in the green room,
chilling out, our good friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsey, the traveling stoner,
showed up and she had her beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, Molly, with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Lindsey and Molly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They encouraged me to have another bag of
chips and get my shit together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get back to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lindsey and our new friend,
Molly and I went and cruised around the
[SPEAKER_00]: secret sesh and shout out to our friend at
TNT Extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude gave me a donut that got me
wrecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to whoever made the strawberry
lemonade or the pink lemonade cupcakes
[SPEAKER_00]: with the chocolate or the peppermint bark
on top of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my brain still may be fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were 250 or 300 milligrams
each and I ate two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was pineapple and strawberries and
some other random fruit that was chopped
[SPEAKER_00]: up that had medicated chocolate ganache
that was hot on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the secret sesh, I got stupid lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walked up and tried to talk to me
and I was kind of non-responsive,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had eaten about 850 to a thousand
milligrams of edibles and I had smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: about four or five grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in no condition to be
conversational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to everyone at the secret
sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to our friends at TNT
Extractions and Schumet Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dudes gave me a 1000 milligram
edible and I ate that 1000 milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: edible yesterday on my way to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I got to work,
it felt like somebody had replaced my
[SPEAKER_00]: blood with sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body was so dry and heavy that I just
wanted to curl up in a corner and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not been that ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I wasted probably a day and a
half because the entire day I was useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then half of today, it took me half of
today to get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a thousand milligrams will fuck you up
if that's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oh my God, I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a shamanic journey,
but I had to go and live my day doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go to work and I had to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that unless you can lay around
and just be lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you can make it to the next
Secret Sesh, you need to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Adam Mill and all those
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try to list names because
I will forget mad people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I want to get into some
iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't read the iTunes comments in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are one or two more that we
haven't read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pulling up iTunes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting to the comments section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like it if you guys would go to
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the amount of stars that you feel
I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me know what you think about the
show because I really do appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I am here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the new comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our new comment comes from our friend
Tarantula Hawk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left this comment May 18th,
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, this is hands down the best
informational cannabis grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff doesn't overload you with
endless advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Informative, free, and entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to Jeff and the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like it, review it and donate a few
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up, it's that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a hell of a good comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I noticed when I used to
listen to another cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would ask a grow question and
instead of giving solid grow advice,
[SPEAKER_00]: the host of that show would sell you a
product and it wouldn't solve your
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would temporarily solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would mask your problem is what it
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd have to keep buying that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is if you have a problem
in your grow, if you say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have spider mites, I like to help you
figure out how you're getting spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, teach you how to correct that so
that you don't ever get mites again,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of having to buy some product that
is sponsoring me over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate that you noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free and entertaining and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things I aim to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to me and the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will share the love with the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're all listening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, this dude Tarantula Ha gave
us mad love and then give your mom a hug
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do that and then review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you guys review the podcast,
go to iTunes and leave a review,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like this guy says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also donate a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, PayPal did not like me
having a cannabis related podcast linked
[SPEAKER_00]: to their PayPal service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PayPal has shut me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a way to receive donations,
but if you'd like to make a contribution
[SPEAKER_00]: to the show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will figure out how to receive your
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so big shout out to Tarantula
Ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave us a five star rating and wrote a
super, super sweet comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next comment comes from 100% Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that's Clint that's
been on the show or if that's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: listener, but they gave us a five star
review and they left a comment on May 20th
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it simply says, give your mom a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time I see my mom, I owe her two
hugs and I want you guys to do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you see your mom, just give her
a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell her Rasta Jeff says, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows who I am, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that was the iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody that sent a
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go to iTunes,
like I said, and post a little comment,
[SPEAKER_00]: post a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something you'd like to say
and you don't want to do it on the iTunes
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, you can always send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I am on all of the social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Facebook, I'm on Instagram,
I'm on Twitter, I'm on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me, support all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of social media, a couple of
days ago I saw a post from my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole West, big shout out to Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole is, she's well established in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She posted something to Facebook that I
thought I would share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, dear people applying for jobs in
the cannabis industry, just a few tips and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can support everything she says here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tip number one, please do not make the
first sentence of your intro email be,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pass a drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be self-explanatory,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, if you failed at attaching the
correct document or attaching the document
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly the first three times,
I don't think the fourth time is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get you your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, when you're going to attach,
when you send in your resume to work at a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, you need to include a copy of
your badge and probably a copy of your ID
[SPEAKER_00]: and there will probably be more documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attach that shit, don't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attach your resume, don't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you guys, I heard a friend talking
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine got an email that was
addressed to the wrong person.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend's name is Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email said, hey Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates to me and Lee that this
email was a mass email sent to multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: people and all the person was doing was
going and changing the name as who the
[SPEAKER_00]: letter was addressed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make sure you change that shit if
you're sending an application or a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say dear live well when you're
trying to work for the clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get that shit correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number three, do not ask me to how to
get a badge in your intro email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're applying for a job, do not ask
the person giving you the job how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a whole episode on how to get
your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and listen to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll truly help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, please do not spend the
entire interview talking about how shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: the last dispensary you worked for treated
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you worked for another dispensary and
you're trying to work for ours,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want to hear about the problems
at the old place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you're dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you're going to bring some
bullshit to our place that we simply do
[SPEAKER_00]: not need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your drama at home, especially
during an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, know basic weights and
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're coming to work at a dispensary,
know what an eighth weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what a quarter weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what a half ounce weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what an ounce weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start understanding weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to eyeball an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to throw an eighth on
the scale just by grabbing it and tossing
[SPEAKER_00]: it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get good at that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, 3.5 grams is an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 28.35 grams in an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That .35 does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people skip the 28.35.
[SPEAKER_00]: 28.35 is a true ounce you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your math from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then number six, regardless of the job
you're applying for, always dress
[SPEAKER_00]: professional at interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're coming in to be a tremor,
even if you're coming in just to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: entry level person at a dispensary,
look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to look presentable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be around products that people
are going to buy and consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want scuzzy people hovering
over their cake or their baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want scuzzy people hovering over
the medicine that you're going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in a medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need clean people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a clean environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, those were a few tips that my
friend Nicole posted to Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be really helpful to
share this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a smart ass stab at people
trying to get a job, but it's so real that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was worth sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she meant to post something smart ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it seriously because some people
need some help with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Nicole West,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is getting dry as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the point in the show where I'm
going to press pause, take a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs, take a drink, and I will be right
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm back and I am dabbed the fuck
out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to give a huge shout out to my
friends at Elevate Glass at 517 South
[SPEAKER_00]: Tejon in beautiful downtown Colorado
Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a new rig, if you need a new
nail, if you need some smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: accessories, I highly recommend Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also one more important thing I need to
mention, you guys, I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to remind you again politely,
kindly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at you, but I cannot ship
anybody any seeds at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not send seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for seeds, I can
recommend that you search the internet for
[SPEAKER_00]: thedankteam.com, the D-A-N-K team,
dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be able to help you out,
but I certainly cannot get you any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's enough
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to an email that I received.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Seb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Rasta Seb down there in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being the coolest Facebook
troll ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we're bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we've sat around and smoked
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met the dude in person,
but he is family now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Seb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow Rasta Seb on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him know that you found out about him
through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes some really funny memes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I act like I don't see them
because I don't even know what the fuck to
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he sent me a long Facebook message with
several questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go through a couple of them
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, he says, how can a humble,
simple, ganja farmer folk avoid buying an
[SPEAKER_00]: RO and get rid of chloramides?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's asking how he can get rid of the
chlorine and whatever else the water
[SPEAKER_00]: company is putting in your water without
buying a reverse osmosis machine because
[SPEAKER_00]: those are quite expensive and sometimes
people can't afford that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you don't have anywhere to put
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can a simple ganja farmer get rid
of the chlorine and the stuff that the
[SPEAKER_00]: city is putting in our municipal water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite simply, you can put it in a giant
jug and set it in the sun and the sun will
[SPEAKER_00]: help evaporate off any of those
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend putting, if you need to
do it indoors, if you have to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, most of us have to, put the
water, put the tap water in a reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever size you're using, and put a lot
of air stones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put air stones in there and make it bubble
real heavily because then you'll move all
[SPEAKER_00]: that water around in surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for clearing my throat over and
over again, but surface area is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wanna bring some of that water from
the bottom up to the top and help move
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that chlorine that's trapped in
there up to the top and then it can
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the easiest way is just to put your
water in a big container and put air
[SPEAKER_00]: stones in it and bubble the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a nice air bubbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: An air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get yourself a nice powerful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make one that's got like eight air
things coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put all eight of them in like a 30 gallon
trash can and fill that sucker with water
[SPEAKER_00]: and just pump the shit out of the air into
there and that'll get rid of the chlorine
[SPEAKER_00]: or the chloramide or whatever you're
worried about in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get rid of most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, before you give that
to your plants, make sure you adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the pH of that, adjust it before you
feed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the plant's age, their pH,
they will want different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you can get rid of that
stuff and it's free and it doesn't take
[SPEAKER_00]: much but time and a little bit of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go buy yourself an air
pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question Seb asked is,
thoughts on mycorrhizae and trichoderma
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria beneficials do you use and how
much?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wants to know which of these
beneficials I use and how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several brands out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mostly the same, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several brands that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Great White Shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I like OG BioWar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chunkier white ones seem to work the
best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my clones come out of the cloner and
they're going into a cup of soil or a
[SPEAKER_00]: small pot of soil, I like to sprinkle a
little bit of the Great White Shark around
[SPEAKER_00]: the base area where the roots are gonna
hit and then put, or also, I can't forget
[SPEAKER_00]: this one, Dragonfly Earth Medicine,
they make a Lush Roots is also a great
[SPEAKER_00]: product for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust the roots in there or put a little
right where the roots are gonna go and
[SPEAKER_00]: then bury the plant into that and then
when I, I let the roots grow in that cup
[SPEAKER_00]: or small container for a long time until
it's almost too much and then I transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the next container and as I do,
I'll coat right where I'm gonna put the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll coat that area with just a sprinkle
of whatever powdered root inoculant sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing that I'm gonna use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's Great White Shark, if it's OG
BioWar, whichever brand you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a whole bunch of different
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mostly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Great White Shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affordable, it's cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG BioWar is affordable, it's
cost-effective, it's worth its weight in
[SPEAKER_00]: gold in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those would be the two I'd recommend,
the Great White Shark or the OG BioWar and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't use too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it when you go from the cloner into
the cup and then when you go from the cup
[SPEAKER_00]: into the pot and then if you go into
another pot, do it again every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right where you're putting those roots,
the fresh roots, just put some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: into the dirt right where those roots are
gonna touch and then I like to fill a
[SPEAKER_00]: container with clean water and then I just
mix the powdered solution into the water
[SPEAKER_00]: with my nutrients and feed it to the
plants just like a water feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I feed all my other nutrients
and I feel that that helps soak it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got some that was in there
with the roots when I put it in there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt, it's already touching it,
the roots are eating it and then I feed
[SPEAKER_00]: some in kind of like a tea so that it can
get more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to give it that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it all, give it, excuse me,
once again, give it these things all
[SPEAKER_00]: through the veg phase like maybe once
every other week through the veg phase and
[SPEAKER_00]: then do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first three weeks in flower would not
be a bad idea at all because you wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: build those roots and keep those roots
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that answers your question,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which beneficials do I recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question, you said my thoughts
on LED lights, the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking better tricone production
maybe if used in conjunction with HBS,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to mention energy savings 10 to one
for similar lumens output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of great shit come from
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any experience with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, they're expensive and I'm afraid
to invest in a light that's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make my plants perform the way that they
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the right situation, if you're in a
small area and you can't run a big light,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If what you're able to do is run an LED,
run an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Amanda has an LED and I've seen
pictures of her cannabis plants and they
[SPEAKER_00]: look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't argue with the LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Nancy Budwell, I don't know if
she listens to this podcast, but shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Nancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She grows with a lush LED and her plants
look fucking stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her plants look really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of great stuff from LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have any experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are totally accurate with the cost
effectiveness of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do keep electricity costs
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights themselves don't pull as much
power, which means they don't make as much
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, which means you don't need as much
air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the right LEDs, I'm sure that
there are some cheap China-made ones out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that you wouldn't want to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are some great
American-made LEDs that would work very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just do your research if you're going
to buy an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's the best I could say on
their tricone production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to help you out with
tricone production because you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more types of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make the plants grow a
little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's going to change the,
gosh, I'm sorry, you guys, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: choking up over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change the nutritive cycle
of that plant a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to speed it up a little bit,
I feel like, because it's getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: different light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to probably need to feed a
little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be adjustments to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you shift from an HPS to an LED or if
you add an LED to your HPS room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see different shit
happening that you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Subcool hang a Lush LED in his HPS
room and the plant underneath it hated it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's just because it wasn't
Subcool's grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to adjust some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that answered your question about
LEDs in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one is why, I want to ask why
more commercial grows don't get solar to
[SPEAKER_00]: offset massive power costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, at the amount of electricity
we're using, I don't know that solar would
[SPEAKER_00]: even be a viable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know enough about solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I would have to research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, we pull, we've got 85 1000
watt lights in one room and 25 1000 watt
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electricity bill is high, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also got shit, tons,
tons and tons of air conditioning on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of that building that just keep us cool
all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really warm today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not really warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fairly warm today outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get way hotter, but it was
fairly warm and the building was nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably 74 degrees in the whole
building and we've got a nice office
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a trim area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a shit ton of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, wow, that motorcycle was so
loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys heard that because it kind
of scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that we could get enough
electricity through solar to run all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am not an electrical engineer
or anywhere educated in any means of solar
[SPEAKER_00]: power, but that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would guess, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he asked me question number five,
Seb said, how do you keep so cool under
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure when the cop pulled you over?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also said, being responsible
for so much medicine and patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it keep you awake at night worrying
about timers and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any tips on how to relax and not freak out
like I tend to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well shit, bro, I didn't worry about
timers and stuff until you just pointed it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm having a damn panic attack and I
want to check the cameras on my phone and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if everything at the grow is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just totally joking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I keep my cool under pressure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when that cop pulled me over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a grown ass adult and that cop's
just a grown ass man with a job to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have anything to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess being a white dude with a nice
car probably helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't feel like I was worried about
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause I mean, we know I'm not even
kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a different race, it could have
been a totally different outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not accusing this cop of anything,
but we know how things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being a spoiled white dude helps me out
for sure in that case, keeping my cool
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just well-educated and I speak
well and I'm very sociable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't worry about cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just people with a job to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not doing anything stupid
and hiding anything, most of the time you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be cool, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just, I hoped for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's how I stayed cool with the
cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm not intimidated by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the person next to me is Rasta Seb,
if the person next to me is white Mike,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the person sitting next to me is
Lindsay, or if the person sitting next to
[SPEAKER_00]: me is the president, or if the person
sitting next to me is whoever,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all fart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have to go pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to eat food to live life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all just people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, people don't make me nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all just people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like rock stars are just people that play
guitars real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get nervous around people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I keep cool in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part about being responsible for so
much medicine and patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it keep me awake at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because I wouldn't be in the position
if the people that put me, that let me
[SPEAKER_00]: have this position didn't have full trust
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would not, I wouldn't even do it if
I didn't have faith in myself that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say straight up like, Hey,
this is not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't handle this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I've got good backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my, I do run that grow by myself for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I need help, I can call hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunt will come help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can call Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach will come help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a trimmer that's there trimming
eight days a week now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can have him help me if there is
trouble in the grow that I need help with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I am responsible for it,
but it doesn't keep me awake at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the building really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every timer in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what time everything clicks on,
what time everything clicks off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the temperature is in each
room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't worry too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said, does it keep you awake
at night worrying about timers and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one time, dude, it was late,
it was midnight and I was laying down to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I should check the cameras
at the grow just to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an hour away from my house in
good weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at the camera and I can see that
this one pump has broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it on the camera that a tank
that should have been fed to these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: was totally full and the pump had not
pumped in several hours, probably six good
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if these plants didn't get a drink of
water within the next three or four hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: it probably were going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was midnight and I was getting
ready to go to bed and I saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did the only thing I could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on my shoes and I got in my car and
I drove the hour there and I fixed the
[SPEAKER_00]: pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it took me maybe five minutes to
fix that pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got back in the car and my car had
broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get my car fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tow it home that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really funny because it was five
in the morning by the time I got home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can check and see if anything goes
really wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, I've been there long
enough to where I know, like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, I know every timer in that
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every breaker in the breaker box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every, if a leaf moves in that
room, I know which plant it was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how well I know that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't stress me out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't keep me up at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, if you smoked as much hash,
as I did and smoked as many edibles as I
[SPEAKER_00]: did, you'd have no problem sleeping at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just have faith in myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I've been doing this for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a confident dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I write notes on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got billions of little post-it notes
all over the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That honestly helps me keep my cool
because just all the shit that I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I figure finish a couple of
tasks, I cross them off the list and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: the post-it note away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give me something that I need to
remember, I just write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep posted notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really helps me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that really helps me keep
my shit together is notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I talk notes into my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I tell Siri, hey Siri, make a note
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Siri will remind me later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any tips on how to relax and not freak out
like you tend to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chill out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you so fucking worried about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you, chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're doing, be confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably gonna fuck up,
but that's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do, fix it and you'll be
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I run a big ass grow and I was
talking to a guy, we're opening a new
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and I was talking to a guy and
he's like, so what's the first thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: do when you get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, honestly, the first thing you
do every morning when you walk into a big
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is find the surprise because I'm
gonna say twice a week, I walk into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and there's a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day, a breaker had flipped and a
cloner filled with clones that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breaker flipped and that cloner,
all those clones died because the breaker
[SPEAKER_00]: went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, the building next door to mine,
all of their power went out because of a
[SPEAKER_00]: breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with me, but I mean,
there's always weird shit like that going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always gonna be surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how hard you do it,
you're gonna get some kind of surprise and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's how you deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be ready to deal with some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out and have faith in
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got this far and you're gonna fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how old you are, no matter how
much you've done it, you're gonna make
[SPEAKER_00]: some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's gonna laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we are, but laugh at yourself too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you overflow a reservoir,
get the squeegee and push that water down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the drain and then mop up the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next time, don't overflow that
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kill a plant, remember what you
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't kill a plant again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I stay, that's how I don't
freak out about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at this a long time and I've
dealt with a lot of mistakes and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I'm prepared to deal with
almost anything you can throw at me in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I haven't dealt with it yet,
I'm ready to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I don't freak out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stay confident and know that I got
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are gonna die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reservoirs are gonna overflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights are gonna fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen lights just completely fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen tables fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just confident that I can deal with it
when it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that is cause I got a little bit
of faith in me and some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes me confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I wanna give a huge shout
out to my buddy Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seb, thank you for five, what'd you send
me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were more questions in that message,
but I've been going for 33 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like most people only stick
around for 36 minutes is what the
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics show when I look at my stats
for my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you guys like a 36 minute
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting close to that,
which means I should start wrapping this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks everybody who listened for this
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more emails with more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am getting to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sent me a message, if you sent me
an email, I will answer your questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get emails and messages on a lot of
different platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to find all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really cool of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can send your questions and
comments to me through the email,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will check that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the podcast stuff will be
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just look at it and be like,
oh look, there's Bill's email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I could just read it and it'll be
so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool if you wanna send them on
Facebook and all that, but sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: lose them and I forget where they are and
then I gotta go searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to take screenshots on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when I have your email and I
wanna use it, I screenshot it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, send me questions via email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to our friends at
Elevate Glass, 517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have said the wrong address in a
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevate, I'm sorry, smoke a lot of dabs
and you gave me a cool rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give a huge shout out to my
friend, Chris, also known as Bobo Blaster
[SPEAKER_00]: Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna send it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big virtual hug to your brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait till you get back from your
little trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope things are well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, earlier I was talking about the
secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Lindsey for hanging out with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Molly for hanging out with me
and keeping me alive because I may have
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a nap in that damn chair if you
ladies did not rescue me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, this is the end of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be really cool if you went to iTunes
and do what those other folks did at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to iTunes, find the iTunes store,
go to the review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in a find the grow from your heart
podcast, find the review section,
[SPEAKER_00]: type in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in some stars, just click on some
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say give me five, but that's kind
of begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think I only deserve three,
throw me three stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go there, leave a comment, throw me
some stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what would be even cooler is if you
told like three or five of your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: about the podcast, you're like,
dude, you should hear this guy's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to it on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to it on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can even hear it on Tok Radio,
tokradio.com on Wednesdays at 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can even go to his website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ireageneticscolorado.com and go to
the podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can listen to all the episodes
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell your friends about that shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you tell like three to five people,
maybe one or two of them will start
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's just how shit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone's gonna listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tell a lot of people, and then a
couple few people will listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more people are gonna learn how
to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more people are gonna learn about
freeing the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people are gonna learn about the
healing properties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, you know what's gonna
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to legalize cannabis
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to be a sponsor of the
podcast or if you've got a product you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like me to review, all you've gotta do is
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's growfromyourheartathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get you all of the
information that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's all I've got for this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in seven days with another
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a lot of time working on the
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me.
Here, try my margarine spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that counts, but as of late,
friends eat what's on my plate so I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: make ends meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I hear is, can I get you back next
week?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, get me that check, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says I nickel and dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't make it rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: A slight trickle is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if I were a rich man, then I'd play a
little whittled fiddle on the roof,
[SPEAKER_02]: sipping some wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We raise the stakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We force the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make a killing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So put your hands to the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your rupees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your shekels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your dollar currency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your foreign...
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, partner with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you don't need a bank
account.
You don't need a bank account.
You don't need a bank account.
