[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of show notes and video
descriptions and links.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did add a Canadian vendor to the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right on the website, I read
genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added an official Canadian vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the website, I read genetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either click on the vendor tab or
scroll down to the vendors and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: show you a Canadian flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an official Canadian vendor of I
read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is official.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do endorse and support that vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you shop with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in Canada, that will help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to all my Canadian friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my friend in Canada for helping
me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I read genetics.com for the I
read genetics Canadian vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a new vendor being added.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be up there by the end of this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully by the time this episode comes
out, make sure you check out the list of
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the vendors do have different
inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them sold out of some things
earlier than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some still have some stuff in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some just got fresh drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to stay updated is to go to
the website and join the newsletter at I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spot to type in your email
address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to send out a newsletter
approximately the first of every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a little bit after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to get caught up, get some updates,
get some things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get it out around the first of
the first Monday of every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let you know where there are new seed
drops, new coupon codes, new merchandise,
[SPEAKER_00]: new deals, maybe new events happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do join the newsletter on I read
genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to keep me focused today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor season is wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of podcasts already
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discussing it, but keep an eye out for bud
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are experiencing bud rot
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an outdoor crop and you've
not already taken it down, it may be time
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into hurry up mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurry up and get that shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we can't make the plants ripen any
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can feed it a few products,
but we can't get it to go much more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, but pay attention for that bud
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would rather cut down a little bit
early than not get to smoke it at all
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's got bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do experience bud rot, don't try to
just cut around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just cut it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw that shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't blast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from your mistakes and do better
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not get anybody sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supposed to be medical marijuana,
not get you sick marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another, another thing I'm not even going
to edit that big stutter there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your plants may be done at the top
and not at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your big buds may be getting
ripened and finished up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're afraid of those getting any
sort of bud rot or mold here at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: because at the end is when the plants are
very susceptible to most issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to prevent a lot of that,
you can take the tops of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger, more ripened parts of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take those and leave the lower
parts of the plants to ripen further.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few advantages of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main advantages is that you get
your product indoors earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get the option for bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get the option for thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get the option to maybe have
somebody else find your crop if it's in an
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal area or on somebody else's
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know there are some people out there
doing their thing, old school style.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can take those top buds off,
get them in, get them cleaned up,
[SPEAKER_00]: start drying those, start getting them
ready for the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can trim those, move them out of
the way and cut down the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're not overwhelmed with one
gigantic harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can let those bottom buds finish
if that's how it works out on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time they do finish from the
top down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get those bigger buds at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll let the bottoms ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're getting all that big bud out
of the way of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get more sunlight down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get more airflow to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, prevent your mold,
your mildew issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so what did you learn this year
in your outdoor garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do differently to
have a better outcome this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you crushed it this year,
but what are we going to do better next
[SPEAKER_00]: year?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something you can do better no
matter how good you did, no matter how fat
[SPEAKER_00]: your harvest was, no matter how turpy that
shit was, no matter how successful you
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you are, the best way to
be a good grower is to figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to improve upon that next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your drying cure method needs work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your trimming needs work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your timing needs work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm going to do better next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will plant ahead better next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize I would have outdoor
space until kind of the last day to put
[SPEAKER_00]: plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, they're going into flower
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, if we think about other
people's plants and look at theirs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make larger plants to go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, I couldn't do that because
I didn't have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make better selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did good at selecting plants for
outdoors, but I learned that a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: things take way too long to even go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one plant in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you hear this, they've been
chopped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one plant out there that is not
finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not make pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get very many seeds because it
was very late to go into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very late to go into the state
where it can take pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant is still flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else is cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bad bitch is still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't run that one outdoors ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned my lesson there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that a couple of them went into
flower really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finished really early and they banged
out a ton of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them didn't give me as many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot of lessons on plant
selection for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some issues and some things and I
saw which plants experienced issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: which plants didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will prep and prepare for issues better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what to expect in a new
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to prepare for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to treat for things that are
coming because I know what is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know when to harvest also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have any idea when my seeds
would be ready when we put the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we would be going until
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not even go until the middle of
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were cutting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle of September we started
chopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's October 1st now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they got done much earlier than I
had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned a lot within that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant selection and timing is mainly what
I learned outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had people growing doing a lot of the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were other people doing a lot of the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I should say is that I
could probably train the crew a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching, listening,
you did exactly what I said to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were things I probably could have
explained better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have said when, how, where and why
with a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that next year you're kind of able to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could have trained the folks that
were working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't even working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the work and it was a good
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I guided them well,
but I could have done better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a minute since I've been in a
big commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to running big grows with a lot
of people and COVID kind of slowed me
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was working with friends and I
didn't want to go in there and act like I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in a commercial grow, telling my
friends what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a dynamic for me to learn
there, but I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all still friends and the harvest is
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing with friends,
a lot of times the grow with friends will
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin fucking relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told my buddy going in, I was like,
dude, I don't care about the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: the money as much as when the end of this
comes out, we still have to be fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: friends no matter how this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to give you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to give me space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be your friend in the end of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can't fuck up our relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that went well, but I could probably
work on training my crew a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a good job, but some of the
things we could have done better if I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about things a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I was learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my first inaugural outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of in the process of processing
the outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are excited for those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a minute, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking, it's a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me and there's a lot of plants,
a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit's got to dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get the seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to get the seeds sorted, counted,
packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to order more packaging because
I look like I might be getting low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going more quickly than I
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for buying seeds,
but give me a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my point is I hope you,
the first point, I hope you learned a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors and I hope you took notes and I
hope you made notes on what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared with you what I learned and what
I will try to improve next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next point is that those
seeds will be ready very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to save.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I was intending to save some of
them and use most of them for the Indo
[SPEAKER_00]: Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I honestly have no idea if
the Indo Expo is happening, if it still
[SPEAKER_00]: exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full disclosure, since they won't even
respond to me, I'll tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I know about the Indo Expo,
the owner of the Indo Expo passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that they were going to have a
meeting and figure out what would happen
[SPEAKER_00]: with the future of Indo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every email I've sent to every email
address that exists that I know of for
[SPEAKER_00]: Indo Expo, either the employees have
replied and said, we don't work there
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fired us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that ends in endo at endoexpo.com
comes back undeliverable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That email address does not exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, it does not look good for
Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an official statement from
anybody but Rasta Jeff of iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any faith in that event
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds that I was making that were
intended to go out there, they may come
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may come out sooner than anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may get to play with them before
we expect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may work out to your benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure out what happens with Indo
Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may just let them out early just
because we'll call it the pre-release or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good and stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's keep myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good ganja waiting for me
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gotta say Rasta Jeff is coming to
this city.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody will probably some cops
will come arrest me in some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most countries, in most places,
somebody will find me and have some good
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that rabble shit I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a good Patreon message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they want to be addressed?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be known as Colin,
CEO and Cultivation Director of Sacred
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree Organic Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, big up to my buddy Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a few, we've been corresponding,
I think is the way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good dude, great message, good vibe,
and I'm happy to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check us out on IG at Sacred Tree Organic
Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, do check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says we are a Colorado-based,
we are Colorado-based, but headed to
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia to open our first dispensaries as
licensing opens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do an Instagram live show every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday at 7-10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mountain time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 7-10 my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw out my iPad on the computer desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a couple of dabs and hang out with
the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to join us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get a notification,
so you've got to follow me and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: 7-10 my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top and see if there's a red
dot that shows I'm live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, go to my profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's like 7-15 because Instagram
doesn't let me log in and do the live
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away, it makes me fucking jump
through hoops sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm doing here is I am inviting you
to the Instagram live, but what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say is there's a lot of people
from Virginia in the live lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining, but where did you
guys all come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cool to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to all my new Virginia friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people popping into the
Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you came from,
but I'm glad that you are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big up to the new legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to the Virginia crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is moving to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wants to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the first dispensaries and licensing
opens, that is such a way to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get there right as it starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in there as everything is developing
around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know everybody in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know who to deal with and who not
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be involved in making regulations,
making rules, setting standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to get in at the ground level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, we are back as a patron
and we want to shout you out for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: help and professional support you give to
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you not only for the Patreon
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the funding and the support that
way, but the compliments and noticing that
[SPEAKER_00]: professional support for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means as much as the Patreon funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, do not stop the Patreon funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a question for you and
hopefully it will give you enough to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, with the mood I'm in and whatever I
smoked, I think just about anything would
[SPEAKER_00]: get me talking for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what past issues of Colorado's
legal cannabis program expanding would you
[SPEAKER_00]: like to see other states avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like our friend is moving to
Virginia to get going and he'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: find some advice on some pitfalls that he
can avoid in the newly emerging,
[SPEAKER_00]: newly developing legal market in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we set a good framework here,
we've been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got just a regular industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it just seems like something that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a fancy industry or a fancy
place to go anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a good framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seen the good and bad and the
things to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other states should avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I wrote down and it's very
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, I believe that we use too
much packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with having a safe product that is
tamper-free and kind of child-resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but child-proofing comes from parenting
and that happens at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We waste too much plastic and too much
shit in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of instances, if you buy an
edible, if one is to buy an edible,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will come in a multi-layered cardboard
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that you have to push two pieces down
on one end and pull a tab on the other to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull one cardboard sleeve out of another
cardboard sleeve to slide out another
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard sleeve, which will contain a
plastic, like a shell casing, which then
[SPEAKER_00]: will probably have a plastic film over it,
which underneath that will then have your
[SPEAKER_00]: small tiny chocolate product inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a product, the packaging is bigger
than an iPhone for a product that is
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than a KitKat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, that's a lot of fucking
plastic, a lot of paper, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging to go into a landfill to give
the idea of child-proofing
[SPEAKER_00]: child-resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it a moment ago, child-proofing is
something that happens at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whiskey bottles, all it takes to open
a whiskey bottle is a good turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to do a bunch of crazy shit
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids could definitely cause more harm
with the whiskey bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different argument, but I think
we waste too much fucking packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I really think is
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a huge problem, but it's something,
if you're developing the rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't make us put a gram of
concentrates in a container, in a box,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a bag, in a box, with a seal,
with a fucking another lock box on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: it with a combination code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make us do so many steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit gets ridiculous and it's very
wasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw away a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, limits on purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that there are reasonable
limits, but I think that some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: limits that Colorado and other places have
been trying to enforce on us are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it a moment ago, I compared it to
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can buy all the whiskey we want,
pour it down our head, and if we die,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's our own fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I buy enough cannabis to smoke
myself into a stupor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't kill myself with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke until I'm hungry and need a
nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, I'm going to wake up and be like,
damn, I smoked all my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the biggest problem I've ever
really caused, smoking too much weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat everything in the refrigerator,
everything in the cupboards, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good because of that, but I've never
had a mean hangover and been violent from
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limits are kind of silly a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand some limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why shouldn't you be able to buy a pound?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go to the dispensary and
buy a pound, maybe get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that's for redistribution
purposes, but if cannabis was legal
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere and there was a dispensary
everywhere, nobody would be
[SPEAKER_00]: redistributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so some of the limits I do
think are a little bit silly, although I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the reason, but other rules
make those reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I would really would like to
have seen, and I think I'm doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said issues that we could have
avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of talking about things like just
small details, but something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: skipped ourselves on is a safe place to
consume our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of viewing my city.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I cruise around, if I come from the
interstate, I pass one, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I keep going that way, there's one,
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's apothecary farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two out that I could probably
drive to 10 or 12 dispensaries within
[SPEAKER_00]: seven or eight minutes, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's nowhere around here to smoke
any of the product that I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two really cool parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a state park.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a skate park.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's illegal to smoke at those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot consume cannabis at the city
park.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the state park, at the skate park.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really cool if we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say we don't, but you're not
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get caught there, it's like an
actual crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually can get in trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the city, most of the time they'll
say, hey, you can't fucking smoke here,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like at the city park, the skate park,
shit like that, they will definitely be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no safe place to consume
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to come home or I've got to go
somewhere else and kind of hide and smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: in the car, which if you're a tourist,
that's not cool because what if you're new
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't smoke like I can and you go
buy some dabs and you go park somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and you hit a dab pin and now you're
sitting in your car just fucking roasted
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't know what to do,
where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only safe place is that car right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at the park, you can fucking
roll around in the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go down the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way more safe than just being stuck
in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no driving to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at the park, you could drive the
bench and you're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed the ducks and you'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a place to come and consume
would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke freely here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there were a place where I could go
socialize and consume cannabis with my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends freely and openly, I'd go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do the podcast from there
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have groups of people there,
like just do shows there, have irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics parties there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be just way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have all those kind of drinking
establishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we have cannabis consumption
establishments?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep comparing this to cannabis,
but in Colorado, we did do the regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis like alcohol model, and we're
still not following that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treat it way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before, I can buy all the whiskey
that I can fucking load into the car at
[SPEAKER_00]: the liquor store, but I can't buy all the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some silly rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I wrote down is delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two thousand twenty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything gets delivered now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My food comes to my front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: My all my Amazon stuff comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I want just comes to the front
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely have to leave the house to go buy
any products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get my groceries delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can rely on all that stuff to show up
except my cannabis in California and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just call a service and they will
deliver your product to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that delivery would be a great
option, especially for a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some people can't get on the bus,
can't get an Uber, can't get a cab to go
[SPEAKER_00]: buy their ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just help them out just to get
that stuff delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I already basically know
what I want from the dispensary that I
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which brand I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what type of product I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically just need to see what's on the
list and see what's available in those
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters and pick the strain or the
flavor or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know because I've been to that
dispensary so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my favorite product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can online shop the shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allowed eight grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just click two of these, two of these,
four of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty percent tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty percent whatever they give me the
option for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably check mark boxes in the
app that I built in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like Grubhub, but it's
Dabhub or something, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dubhub.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just bring you some dubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just fucking click it up and they show
up just like Grubhub.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They check your ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the person that fucking paid for
it is the one showing ID and they go,
[SPEAKER_00]: high five Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, here's fucking 20 bucks for a
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful out there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or bring them in and give them a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that sounds really creepy because
after you give people a dab, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think delivery would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing that we are really
lacking here in Colorado, and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to think I'm crazy when I say this because
I act like we're the most progressive
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis state, one of the most
progressive cannabis states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the rules and all that stuff,
but we lack heavily in education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is lacking in the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is lacking heavily in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is lacking heavily in
legislature and council and people that
[SPEAKER_00]: make the rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge lack of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of the people that are
in the role of making the rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding the future of legal and
recreational cannabis are not involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand the growing,
but they're making the rules of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand the distribution or
consumption, but they're making the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: for how it's distributed and who can buy
it, how it's sold, what increments,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know what they're doing and
they're fucking up the profitability,
[SPEAKER_00]: the viability, the longevity, the
enjoyability of the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually asked for something to
avoid, but I think this is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you definitely should try to see if you
can include or something as some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or include people that you know are good
growers, good speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it'd be ideal to find a guy like
myself to go talk to city council with you
[SPEAKER_00]: or be involved with the rulemaking
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the committee is called,
whoever has developed the your state,
[SPEAKER_00]: enter your state's name here, the Southern
Colorado Cannabis Law Invention and
[SPEAKER_00]: Establishment Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be part of that committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever state you're in, get a grower
like myself to be on the GROW committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a spokesperson like Mike to be on the
rule committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to building a team,
we've got to do our best to get people
[SPEAKER_00]: that understand our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to get real quality
products to the people that desire them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're medical consumers, if they're
recreational consumers, our goal is to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a high quality product to those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have somebody on our team
helping make the rules, make the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, helping make the guidelines,
it will really help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get quality products easily accessible to
people that need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think education is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to educate people and then try to put
educated people in the correct positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you end up with shit like we got
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had things like an ex sheriff and an
old PTA teacher and a retired city council
[SPEAKER_00]: person making rules on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess how many of those people smoke
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess how many people thought cannabis was
the fucking devil?
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are those people making rules on
something they don't understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get people that understand, that know what
they're talking about in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike did his best to help, but sometimes
Mike wasn't officially city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was just a citizen speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they gave him the cold
shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking ignored Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Mike for doing everything you
did for Colorado cannabis, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize what you did,
especially for Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you tried to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That struggle was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get somebody like Mike and I on your
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm the white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of stayed back and just spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told Mike like speaking points and Mike
would come to me and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what do you think about this and
what would be better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say, bro, this would really fuck
up growing for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mike would go to city council and
explain my case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got the, I'm wearing a collared
shirt today, but it's a little chilly in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got the button up shirt and the tie
and the glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looks real good for speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look good in the grow and on the
podcast, but send the right person for the
[SPEAKER_00]: right job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some educated people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that I
would definitely change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me recap too much packaging limits on
how much you can purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I overlooked in my notes,
limits on potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of proposals to ban high
potency products in recreational and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to battle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make sure that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want highly potent products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you rather me, if you were a medical
professional, would you rather me take six
[SPEAKER_00]: inhales of smoke through my lungs or would
you rather me take two and get the relief
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think higher potency product where I
only have to smoke two drags of that
[SPEAKER_00]: product, I'm going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs won't get as much stress than
taking six pulls, six drags, six bong
[SPEAKER_00]: rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher potency product is how you achieve
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potency levels, then smoke lounges,
delivery and education is something I
[SPEAKER_00]: would definitely try to work toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you said things that you would
avoid, but those are the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would include.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure exactly what to avoid at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I included what I wanted to say
for that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just twisted your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it my own, but hey, that's how we
do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there is more of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, sacred tree organic farms would
like to do everything possible to progress
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry for the Eastern United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good mission statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever forget that you said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what has been a successful
approach to having these discussions with
[SPEAKER_00]: city council members, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I started really well by saying
send the right team member, send someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that speaks well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a person in our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be disrespectful to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say their name,
but at the end of every sentence they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: they say, use guys, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to take them seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you, bro, but it's hard to fucking
take you seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use guys, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not criticizing, I am, I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good dude, but he is not the
fucking person to send to city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike speaks well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike speaks with a professional manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find somebody with that approach,
somebody that understands your goal,
[SPEAKER_00]: our goal, and then can convey that in a
very professional, well-spoken manner to
[SPEAKER_00]: city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a hot head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want somebody who is
irresponsible, who looks disheveled,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is frazzled, who is late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want somebody put together who can
represent you in the light you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: represented in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do it, if you can do it,
go do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to look good, smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smell like ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in there red.
[SPEAKER_00]: City council, bro, I really think we got
to legalize weed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pick somebody, pick somebody that you
think can be a very good representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is the dude here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then be open and honest about your goals
and your ideas of what you want for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and for the future and for your
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city council people, the people that
you're going to talk to, although most of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are tainted by the devil,
they are people and they'll hear what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a person, they're going to put that
smug face on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do the smug shit that
city council people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they get home and they're
chilling and they're thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might hit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one guy spoke really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing he said about the economy,
making a lot of money and putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: money back into the schools and allocating
a portion of our profit from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to educate the school, that really does
work out because that school is losing
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the potholes on that one street,
we could probably fill those with the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: money too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you speak clearly, honestly,
tell them, your objective and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: know that we're people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not drug addicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not fucking crazy people out there
trying to poison the kids and brainwash
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to contribute to the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offer a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offer a profitable service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offer tax money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want our tax money.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about money, they really
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you let them know that the black
market is selling and buying cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, and we can tax it, they start
going, you know, they're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you let them know that you can
free up police hours by not having them
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck with weed growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start seeing and realizing that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be open, be honest, have a real
conversation, then also be fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't hear you the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't hear you the third time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to just keep telling
them and telling them and telling them
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is what our city needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, we could have solved this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That deficit you're looking for,
that way you're looking to make money.
If we could have solved this deficit,
we could have solved the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had opened dispensary six months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be making enough money just from
their licensing to cover the deficit we're
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing this quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find ways to spin it for them and show
them that cannabis is the way to help your
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be professional, be open and honest
and have conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then out of nowhere, it happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the city council people will come
up to you and secretly privately be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I'm on your team, but I'm not sure
how to fucking play the rest of my team,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just know that I've got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll make a connection within city
council and they'll help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be your friend forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll be able to get info and do
things like that and then build
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of this, everybody
thought it was a gold rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to get in, get rich,
get out, stick around, start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in and realize you're going to be here
for ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got good education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got good ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have a good business
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in and be an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set a standard and show them that you know
how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that showing that we've got
business plans and paperwork and backing
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we're not just a bunch of
potheads and drug addicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that we show that
because that's their first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally when you go to a business meeting
that the business people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we tell this motherfucker?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to give them our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their main objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we tell them?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: What flaws can we find in their business
plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we tell them that they need to go
rework their business plan because their
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers are wrong and all this shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a business advisor and
somebody, a financial advisor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're paid to be a dickhead and crush
your dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go in there and you say marijuana
first or cannabis first, they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the part about looking at your
numbers, looking at your reports,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at your, uh, your performance
sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say cannabis, get out of here,
drug addict pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to beat that before you even
get in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have white, bright eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to brush your teeth, comb your
hair if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to be the guy to go,
but get somebody that can look good and
[SPEAKER_00]: build a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that you're going in there
forever to build a long-term relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to pull the wool over
somebody's eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to pull a trick on
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to let them know, Hey,
we offer a service for your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in return, we will also, money will go
back into the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax money will go back into the community
and will also help to prevent crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will contribute to education.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a great fucking deal for
any city, especially in these times.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this and I'm getting
rambly and the podcast is getting long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the people that ask for
longer episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One Patreon question, approximately 40
minutes big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This more, this part says, for a new brand
coming into the market, what advice would
[SPEAKER_00]: you give to help us reach as many patients
as possible other than social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: business cards?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of my consultation package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get a freebie freebie
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys take some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media is a big part of advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilize the shit out of free advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you've got to be careful
because a lot of the big guys in the
[SPEAKER_00]: social media space don't like our
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're smart about it and you learn
how to dance around the algorithms and
[SPEAKER_00]: dance around the terms of service and not
do anything too stupid, social media
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising is one of the best free
advertising models there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great because it's free to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free to the consumer, which means
everybody's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at drum sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be looking at butts to be quite
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you sneak your dispensary ad in
there, I'm going to see it and it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to hypnotize me because my brain is
looking at all the shit that I really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you just snuck your dispensary ad
in there and it's kind of programmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in that that oh, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, sneakers, dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hitting right in those good notes
that you just got right in the mix on
[SPEAKER_00]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a subliminal thing that I'm
going to enjoy now that I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that social media shit don't overlook
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's free and it's a great way of
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you ask for other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most cities have a local scene paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably named something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Colorado Springs, it's called,
no, in Pueblo, it's called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the same thing in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado Springs Independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Denver area, they've got the
Westward.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your area, it's probably called
something cool also in hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little, it's a thin paper magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local scene magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in the back of that, you can find
ads for all of the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the weed doctors, all the tattoo
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They advertise all the concerts that are
coming up in the shows on the page right
[SPEAKER_00]: before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great place to advertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, when Colorado was new and
the legal market, we would just go get the
[SPEAKER_00]: Westward and the Independent and just turn
right to the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just start backwards basically and
look for the dispensary ads and the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors and the tattoo shops and the
concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I didn't care about all the
articles and shit in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what's going on in your city
and in your art district and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just kind of joking, but that's
the way we would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good place of advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that local advertising is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to events.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that a lot of companies
forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Events like the Indo Expo or whatever cup
is in your neighborhood or whatever place
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go where there are consumers and
vendors and companies meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send a good representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: With business cards, with stickers,
with samples, with something they can give
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cheap schwag that when they're
emptying out their bag on the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll read the pen and they'll go,
oh, I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll find you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Events are a great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go network and meet the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go shake their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see them face to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they remember you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word of mouth is really a great way of
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have amazing customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the vibe and tone that you wish to
set, and then the clientele that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: in there will arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of vibe you want to
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make a reggae dispensary,
paint everything red, gold, and green,
[SPEAKER_00]: play Bob Marley all day, theme all your
shit reggae, you will get the reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get all the white guy Rastas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get all the Rastas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get all the reggae fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get all the cool reggae girls
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be all the hip crowd coming in,
but you'll kind of limit yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will definitely get the reggae crowd,
the Rasta crowd, the vibes crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might not get the soccer moms that
would come in and just grab a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: grams every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get the older guys that
don't want to come in there and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get the older ladies that are
afraid of all the dreadlock white guys
[SPEAKER_00]: because they just don't understand what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to you to create the vibe and
bring in the clientele that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got the classic rock dispensary
that's got guitars on the wall and
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of Corvettes and shit everywhere
and all the guys with mullets and long
[SPEAKER_00]: hair and leather jackets and Levi jackets
and shit come and shop at your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you've got this super swanky
place that looks like a fucking Apple
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always weird to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit too much for a weed
store, but set up the vibe that you like
[SPEAKER_00]: and the clientele will spread the word of
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have amazing customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't nickel and dime your customers to
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen dispensaries just charge a
little extra for every fucking thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: it just feels cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't charge me for the container you're
going to put my product in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels like you're just like just
fucking give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already charged me $100 for the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That $2 fucking container isn't going to
hurt you, but it makes you look like an
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole charging me two bucks for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just throw my weed in the good
container and smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to say, oh, they gave me
this nice container for my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the experience fucking way
different than two bucks for a shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or wow, look at this nice container they
gave me for my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're selling it to me for two
bucks, it costs them 50 cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's changing the entire customer
interaction, the whole vibe of the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't nickel and dime your people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build the crowd that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have the ability to cultivate the
audience and the crowd and the customers
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want at your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use the kind of art that brings the
crowd you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decorate the way you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be a good person to decorate
the dispensary, the waiting room,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensary area, the design of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a streamlined dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like straight lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a nice flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a lot of distracting colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were up to me, the walls would
probably be gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floor would be fucking white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go in, you'd buy weed and you'd
go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let somebody with some flow and
some experience and some ideas do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be a more beautiful customer
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may go in and say, wow, this place is
decorated so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go there to look at the
art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll go in and they'll say,
oh, the shopping experience is set up so
[SPEAKER_00]: nice that I just want to come here
compared to other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have it set up well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then cultivate the audience and the
customer interaction that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share their experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody will tell everybody the
experience they had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the little old ladies enjoy it,
they're going to tell the other little old
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're comfortable there,
you will get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bros like it, they'll go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the snobs like it, they'll go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the hash heads like it, they will go
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to have quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the main things to focus on
is quality products at a fair price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do any shady shifty shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then have people with experience and
education working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we lack here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hire people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're cute, you can work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't care if you know anything about
weed or if you can make change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're cute, we'll fucking hire you and
then figure out the rest as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of sucks sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have quality employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll really help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, and this is kind of a
random mention, creative advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, my friend Jamiri Morgan,
big up to Jamiri Morgan from the Morgan
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamiri is an up and coming reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's getting quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing a lot of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand I read genetics is currently
sponsoring Jamiri Morgan on a few shows of
[SPEAKER_00]: this tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The I read genetics banner will be hanging
on the side of the stage while the band
[SPEAKER_00]: plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a creative way of advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: My logo is on the stage while the reggae
band is playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wearing my shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got my stickers and my advertising
at their booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What more could you ask for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that will really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is creative advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that sort of stuff,
you've got to cultivate relationships and
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a fee for stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creative advertising is a good way for
people to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then don't forget about the cliche and
very common applications and websites that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give me any love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give me any fist bumps,
but don't forget about things like Leafly
[SPEAKER_00]: and Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are big haters on those
applications of those applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so many people view those apps on a
daily basis that if you don't put your
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and your products there,
you're probably missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put your dispensary on any of those
services, please update the damn menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your menu is updated on maybe like
every four hour basis, it shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked at a dispensary before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a person responsible for
doing that, an assistant manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's somebody that loves to sit there
and play on the fucking computer all day,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Update that inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can go on your Weedmaps and click and
see that you have got the products I want
[SPEAKER_00]: in stock versus I wonder if they've got
what I want, I'm going to the place where
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look on Weedmaps and it says,
we have got this in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go there first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So update your Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a very minor detail,
but as a consumer, I've worked on both
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a consumer and I've been a
budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a dispensary manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been all over the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of my job was recon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were building dispensaries and
getting started, one of the first places I
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on my day off, I would go to other
dispensaries and just see what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, how it's set up, what can I,
what do I love and what do I not love
[SPEAKER_00]: about this dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I borrow from this idea to make
my place better?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been to a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on both sides of the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got a lot of experience,
but cultivate the audience you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring, create the vibe you want to bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like you're a very smart
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality products and good customer service
are the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the people want to go there because
you're cool and you're nice and the
[SPEAKER_00]: products are quality, they'll go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one, you'll get some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the other, you'll get some
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got quality products and
great customer service, people will flock
[SPEAKER_00]: to your place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And word of mouth will make that happen
very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And social media is, that's almost word of
mouth right now because people talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media than we do in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to way more people on my phone than
I do in public, in person, on a daily
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, which as I'm saying that,
that sounds wrong and feels weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can post something and between all of
the different accounts and services that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got on Cannabuzz, I've got over
60,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can post something and 60,000 people are
going to see it and it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, I've got 32,000 followers
and I can post something and people will
[SPEAKER_00]: see it and it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's social media advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not discredit that, even though
you did say no social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've been rambling on this message
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually may be the only message of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part of the message says,
thank you for all you do and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: this can make it on the show to help
spread our message and help other growers
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to start a cannabis business get
solid information on what direction to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my friend, I hope we did give you and
other people out there looking to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, some solid information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were really serious about getting
into the industry, my friend Colin here
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't need this advice, but I am
great at setting up and giving advice and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing consultations for the back of the
house, the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got that all figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also help you set up the front of
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use Mike's help on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it comes to building your
dispensary, I've got a friend who is a
[SPEAKER_00]: champ at building dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an amazing person and an amazing
dispensary starter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will design the floor plan,
design the layout, train your staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: set everything up, get you started.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I did not mention,
if you'd like to be successful in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space right now, this is going to
be the last ramble because I didn't write
[SPEAKER_00]: this down and I just thought that this was
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we were talking about, myself,
Mike, and my other consultant friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: right now something that I think is really
important is owning or at least being in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge or probably owning, I guess,
all aspects of your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the processing and the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, that's all your chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vertical integration is what I'm trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do it is to control all
aspects of the entire system, the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do the processing, that is the
best deal, but I understand that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother license, a whole nother thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could do the grow, the processing,
the extraction, and the sales,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can own as many pieces of that
chain as possible, that is how you set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for maximum success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be ideal to own the grow,
the processing, the edibles company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do understand we've either got
a process or have somebody else make
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles for us or buy the edibles,
but the idea is to get 70% of your own
[SPEAKER_00]: products on your shelf and be sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to get the grow operating at
maximum speed to sustain you, to get 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: of your products from that grow onto your
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to figure out how much you
sell every two months, every three months,
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how much that grow can produce
every two or three months, get it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed, get a nice rhythm to where you've
got product in the right areas at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no shortages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that 710 and 420 come up and
you're going to sell record amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in those weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm rambling now, but own
everything that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire chain, vertical integration,
that is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand if you've got to have
other people step in and help out with
[SPEAKER_00]: some parts, but the most profitable way is
vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control all aspects of your product,
where it comes from and where it goes from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get back to wrapping
this one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, again, say thank you for all you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this can make it on the show,
bro, it more than made it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the entire show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that we did help out some
other growers because a lot of people will
[SPEAKER_00]: be moving to new states and there will be
new states coming online that are legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The team is getting stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green team is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited to have so many legal
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have the whole nation here
before too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm getting rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message was signed and wrapped up by
Colin, CEO and Cultivation Director of
