[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you heard it at the beginning,
but let's welcome white Mike to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you sound good on the microphone
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you can keep that mic right
in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to stay right up on this sucker
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple of comments on Mike being
too quiet last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my fault, my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sounded really good in our headphones
that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I hit play that next day after
it posted, I was disappointed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't our fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my fault, technically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one responsible for that,
but it sounds really good in the
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded really good in the headphones
last time when I played it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to keep you real loud
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be cool for the people that
are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apologize if Mike was too quiet last
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a good show this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show where I ask
you, what are you smoking on, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some local flower, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that incognito for gray market,
free market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what local flower means?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a gift from a buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're trying to be vague
on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a nice hybrid, locally grown,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legal to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're allowed to keep and gift your own
harvest, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to love legal land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am smoking on Gunslinger Remix live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about this one on a lot
of episodes lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have bought several grams because I
bought a gram of it, came home,
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbed it, drove back to the dispensary
and was like, I will take my limit,
[SPEAKER_00]: my remaining daily limit on that product,
please.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I may have gone back the next day
and repeated that process because I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy the Gunslinger Remix live batter
from Green Dot Labs real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a blend of Starfighter and Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to taste like sour fruit and
fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back of the package says 65.83% THC
and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great product, great flavor, great buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't talk enough about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, at this point of the
show, I usually do shout outs to people
[SPEAKER_00]: who support my Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a brand new Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow my buddy at patreon
.com forward slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do shout outs, would you like
to do shout outs to the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting you on Patreon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a partial list of supporters
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your idea of doing 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the white Mike 710 club as it stands
right now, EZ057.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Purple Thumb and Prospect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I appreciate everything you
guys are doing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer Z and Learning and Burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys rule?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for supporting what we
do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of familiar names there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking down at my shout out list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we didn't double up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irene Army is supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for supporting white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you want to support white Mike
on Patreon, it is patreon.com forward
[SPEAKER_00]: slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a huge contributor to the show,
to the community, to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So show my buddy a little bit of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thanks to all those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to do the shout outs to the
folks that I owe some love to,
[SPEAKER_00]: my 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to Darius from
Cerritos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the coolest name ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Darius from Cerritos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if we ever hung out if we bumped
into each other at the Cerritos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's send a big shout out to Nurse
Geek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big thank you shout out to Xavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, let's send a big thank you to
Grimbold the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Grim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's send a big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Bongbreath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody named Bongbreath is my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's send a big thank you to Stabby
Mcmotherfucking Stabdude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Stabby?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't see you on Embracing Organics
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I catch up with you next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's send a big thank you to Baked
PWN.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Baked Pwn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like their ponin' motherfuckers,
old school internet slang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked him what the PWN was about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like when you pon people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, big shout out to Baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep ponin' them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I haven't heard from you in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a recent update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Dick Goles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing great again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's send a big thank you shout out
to Andrew G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least on my
long list of thank you shout outs,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a thank you shout out to
our new friend Maroney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who supports the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're not already
supporting the show on Patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost got through that one without
having to clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I think this is the part of the show
where we should just segue into reading
[SPEAKER_00]: emails and listener questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people know that we will get
rambly on accident at some point in this
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have just clipped out you
going segue and just play that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time when I need just a smooth transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Segway.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first email, again, if you've got
an email or a question, a question,
[SPEAKER_00]: a correction or a concern, my email
address is grow from your heart at hotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if this makes it on the show,
refer to me as Senzu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what up Senzu?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I hope all is well with you and yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just dropping in to say the audio
quality is great with the lapel mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I got mixed feedback and mixed
emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I feel like the standalone mic
had more crisp audio quality, but
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless, it sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would imagine it would be perfect
for indulging during the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easier to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easier to just move my arms
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smack this mic a lot, just more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do take up a lot of desk space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't stay on it right here,
like I keep reminded Mike, then you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: hear us and we start sounding like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but yeah, the lapel mic is a new
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk with my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely dab a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it more conversational if there's
somebody in the conversation with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but thank you for the compliments there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, um, also I really
enjoyed the fade in mellow outro music in
[SPEAKER_00]: 552.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember which track I played on
the outro of 552.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have been some music I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was something I did, if it was the
song from Danks for nothing, it was that
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Danks for the amazing
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more music coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I was going to play more
musical submissions on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been so happy with that one
track that I play that that is the new
[SPEAKER_00]: theme song for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get any better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again to Danks for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was well worth the, uh,
the, the recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't miss a first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it says, I have another question
for you just out of pure curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other breeders and genetic companies
do you feel are creating really quality
[SPEAKER_00]: strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are a lot of breeders out
there who just crank out fire strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm curious to know from experience
who else is really breeding from the heart
[SPEAKER_00]: and why you respect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be supporting you on Patreon as soon
as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Able sends you thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't stress too hard over Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say that I will read Patreon
contributors messages first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do read other random messages on the
show that I like that pop up in the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is COVID times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is weird right now, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot expect everybody to contribute to
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am grateful that you are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful that you were contributing
and I'm grateful that you sent me a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this person wants to know who I
respect as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this industry, I wrote down a lot of
names and a lot of breeding companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mainly the people that I, I'm going to
miss people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm afraid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't list everybody I appreciate and
respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took dad's and also I just didn't
prepare well enough to think of everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that I respect and trust in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start it off by saying I
respect and love the work of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing it for the passion of the plant,
of moving the plant forward, of moving the
[SPEAKER_00]: community forward, of moving medicine
forward, of moving recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people I love and respect
and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys that are thinking about
healing and thinking about making people
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they're in the grow, they're just
beaming and smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not impressed with the people who are
growing for their wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that are walking around going,
I'm sure there's four pounds here and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sell each pound for 3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got $12,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to buy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys haven't earned my love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we all fall into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your heart starts pumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back into that grow room and think
about how many people are going to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better when they consume that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making people, we are improving the
quality of people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's our own, if it's medical patients,
if it's recreational patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's those people's families,
Mike, are your kids' lives better because
[SPEAKER_00]: you consume cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much, much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ripple effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the breeders that I've got
the most love and respect for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that are growing with love and
thinking about healing, not the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: growing from their ego or thinking about
dollars in their wallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from your dick to get
chicks, if you're growing from your wallet
[SPEAKER_00]: to get cars, like that's the wrong
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding, especially think about
improving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're chefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all kinds of different things rolled
into one as breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give kind of a generic answer,
kind of a disclaimer that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: miss a lot of people in this list,
but that is what I look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: A breeder that contributes to the
community, a breeder that's been around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, a breeder that has put out
strains that are worth something,
[SPEAKER_00]: not people that come and chuck pollen and
say, here's the most popular candy
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored strain and the most popular,
whatever flavored strain would put them
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to sell a shit ton of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, you'll never know who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole different group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about people that I've
really got some respect for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle of my list, I want to go
ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized I've wrote her down in the
middle of the list, but she's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve a top spot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a shout out to Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Jill is not only, it doesn't,
it shouldn't even count that she's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad-ass woman grower, but there aren't
enough bad-ass women growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The women get overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a boys club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of respect for Miss Jill as
a grower and a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Subi was in prison, shout out to
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Subi was in prison, Jill was getting
cultivation books about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: substituting all of the words that weren't
allowed in prison with the word
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries or whatever else so that she
could get those books to Subi while he was
[SPEAKER_00]: incarcerated to keep his cannabis
education growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not contributing to cannabis,
I don't know what is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being a bad-ass partner,
a bad-ass cannabis person, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being a bad motherfucker in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jill deserves a little shout out and
recognition for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on top of that, she is a bad-ass
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us smoke jelly beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of crosses with jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually this jar right here, orangutan
funk, is jelly bean number 13 crossed to
[SPEAKER_00]: grease monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the jelly bean gives it such a
delicious flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are chasing that jelly
bean turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a guy who's got a breeding company
based off of jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jill created jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill was a big part of TGA, Team Green
Avengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jill gets a lot of credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill is also now making more crosses with
the jelly bean and other crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she deserves a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a breeder that I appreciate and
trust and respect as a person and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got reputable lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's contributed to the industry and
she's not full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longitivity I think shows a lot in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, people come,
they do shit at a booth for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them bang it out next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made enough money in that one
year to kind of cover that year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you need longitivity to have a
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year isn't shit in a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just coming and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a one hit one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a one job done.
That's another job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the show, I'm going to hand it
over to my colleague, Nick, you have a
great story to tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll do my best to answer as many
questions as I can, but it's still stupid.
I haven't asked anything.
I don't know if we're still in this
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great stories to tell
you, Nick, they're all coming and coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to Amsterdam, they left LA and
went to Amsterdam to go do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They abandoned their lives and shit to go
start a new life for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've always had quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always moving the industry
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another name that popped in my
head that I didn't write down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma is an old hippie dude that taught me
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to give a shout out to Subcool
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try to get back on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got Miss Jill, DNA Genetics,
Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of a hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool taught me a lot of what to do and
what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower and a breeder and as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Subcool gets a little spot on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to talk about DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you're not even a breeder and you
know about DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, the first three or four companies
you've listed, that's the foundation of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's legal genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what was everywhere when that got
locked into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of what we enjoy on the shelves
now, this is the grandparent stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it all came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Sub, he had a lot of the stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Jill had stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA Genetics was a lot of the cushy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LA Kush, the LA Confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one that I really liked a whole
bunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Holy Grail Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a part of DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might've been Reserva Provata.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a branch of DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a lot of great breeders
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma, the Lavender, the Soma Mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff came from Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then let me get back on track on my
list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short, that blueberry, Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see blueberry and Flow everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That old school DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry is super sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short is an amazing educator,
an amazing breeder, a great speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to, you got to open him up to get
him to talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not super, he's not mean for sure,
but once you get him talking, he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really friendly, really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got to work our way down to JD,
not just DJ, but JD Short with Second
[SPEAKER_00]: Generation Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but respect for that whole family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed with purpose, with direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pass on shit that is not
stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand the art of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people I've mentioned are breeding
with direction and they understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing something for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to move into a guy who
probably should have been mentioned more
[SPEAKER_00]: high on the list, but I can only do so
many at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking Mr. Soul from Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate Rick Campanella as a
person, as a breeder, as a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: as an educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick, shout out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stylish guy also.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not fit in any box and that is
really cool because everybody's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in a box right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm this white guy,
Rasta hippie thing, but Mr. Soul has no
[SPEAKER_00]: box that he fits in and I fucking love
that about a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're still here with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little glitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep glitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you glitch out too far, I'll fix it,
but I'm going to keep rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think anything went wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep rolling, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love and respect for Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking Cindy 99 is an amazing cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that comes from Mr. Soul is
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you pointing at the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everything going cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut out if anything goes too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Soul is on my list of breeders that
I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He teaches a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not stingy with information and he's
got a very eloquent and classy way of
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking and teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's, he's got like nuclear physics
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember exactly your degree,
sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have respect for that,
but I know he's like an engineer or he's
[SPEAKER_00]: very highly educated from a very
well-known school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's a super smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could talk to me like I'm stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really could, but he doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks to me like we're equals,
like we're brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to an event and shook my hand and
said, hello to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I posted a podcast about Femseeds
and it got the Mr. Soul seal of approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shared the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really, that made me giddy that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else do we need to give love to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Odie fucking Diesel from Homegrown Natural
Wonders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is a really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine if he lived in my neighborhood,
he'd have to kick me off of his couch
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been to more dead shows than a lot of
people I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a cool vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smokes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been breeding for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd have to make me leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just be there hanging out all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be my bro if we live closer to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Odie Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of young hippie kids out there on
the coast loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good kids, mush mouth, the whole gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we could have events to go hang out
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do have one more guy at the top
of my list that I don't talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to write down another
name because I definitely have to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy that I don't talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a badass grower, badass breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got clout.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't watch enough of his videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't social media and quarantine
really made us comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing more live feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're exposing our identities and
ourselves and personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown a lot of respect for JJ from
Top Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he feels like he needs to tell you
to go fuck yourself, he'll tell you to go
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if he feels like he needs to tell you
that he's proud of you, he'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love a person who doesn't hold back
and sugar coat shit just so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have more friends or likes or followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say something about a certain guy
and he's like, nah, that guy fucked me
[SPEAKER_00]: over in 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the New Yorker in him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also talks like a New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that fucking brash New York
accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something about when people
speak differently, I'm drawn to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he breeds well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He deserves the respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these guys I'm talking about,
you've seen their names and their shit on
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising and on science because they've
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those folks all get some huge respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was one more guy I wanted to
mention and his name left my brain while I
[SPEAKER_00]: was talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I did write down Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Kevin Jodry, uh, is a breeder,
a grower, a cultivator, a fucking a
[SPEAKER_00]: hustler, a career hustler, a bad-ass
motherfucker in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the people that I really
think is moving the industry, the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and the plant forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, he does so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks, he teaches, he breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is, I think he is what I was aspiring
to be before I even knew he existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Kevin Jodry is another person that
I've got a lot of respect for and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are more out there that are
going to pop into my brain as the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: goes by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to wish in a couple that
you're going to feel bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as we hit end, you'll be like,
Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy and this guy and this gal
probably to fucking jinx proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do this all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you're breeding out there
and I see you at the events, I got nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: but love and respect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I forgot you on this list, I'm fucking
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit.
I'm high as shit.
I'm high as shit.
I'm high as shit.
I'm high as shit.
I'm high as shit.
I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I'm just not trying to make this a
45 minute segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I appreciate the people that are
breeding with purpose, the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: moving the plants forward, the people that
are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and if you feel like you should have
been on this list and I forgot,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have nothing but love for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the breeders out there, Matt riot,
let's include Matt riot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt riot has a very unique personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt riot has no fear to tell somebody to
go fuck themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt riot is very opinionated,
but also very educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the way he does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he breeds quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only releases quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He understands the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He understands the community and he
understands the history and importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is on my list of breeders that I
trust love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on there, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even though you're fucking opinionated
and you got your personality, I respect
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, people with the
personality that tell you to go fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, even though he may have told a lot
of people to fuck themselves and he
[SPEAKER_00]: ruffles a lot of feathers, doesn't bother
me one bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move on from the breeders
that I love and respect and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank our friend Senzu for the
great message that got me going on a long
[SPEAKER_00]: rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to all the breeders out
there growing from their heart and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it cause they mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, you doing well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your technical glitch is catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, just a little lag issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably because it's our
neighborhood where we are about this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start getting a little glitchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's jump into another message that
came from our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: C dub in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great message, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you may have some good insight
on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says Rasta Jeff disabled veterans
are close to my heart and that of my
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to keep, I try to help them
establish medical grows whenever I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many reasons, these men and women,
the cost of equipment is simply too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to organize a cooperative
amongst growers that would directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would direct older, but usable
equipment from growers who were trading up
[SPEAKER_00]: to this group of veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of whom will suffer, uh, who will
suffer and continuing medical need.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you organize such an effort and
how would you reach out to those that have
[SPEAKER_00]: on behalf of those who don't from C dub in
Michigan?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a very compassionate person
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend C dub wants to know how they
can create a program to get grow equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: from growers hands who are done with that
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're upgrading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they've given up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they've got some new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to move that old equipment
instead of throwing it away, putting it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get it to veterans who are
then able to grow their own medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of these veterans are on a
fixed income.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting social security or
disability checks possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't go very far these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need a little bit of cannabis and
growing it themselves would be the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to get them equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some great ways we could think
of to kind of organize a cooperative and
[SPEAKER_00]: get some used, but still usable equipment
into the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some great ways we could think of
to get some used equipment into the hands
[SPEAKER_00]: of these people who helped us out,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any ideas for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I wrote down a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a tricky one because of the,
the grow community tends to be rightly so
[SPEAKER_01]: quite paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting a whole bunch of people to
gather together and say, Hey, we all grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of, for any reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to, to double down on the,
the difficulty you're adding and asking
[SPEAKER_01]: for donations, donations of expensive
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be all about building
personal relationships with existing
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and prospective growers and
figuring out who needs what and who has
[SPEAKER_01]: what extra and, and helping putting people
either, helping make the switch or putting
[SPEAKER_01]: people in contact with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you're going to have to build your
friends list, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't considered the legality part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're in prohibition land
or if you're in a green state,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's going to play a big factor into
how this program works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried to wrangle growers for stuff
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm like, Hey, I need a whole
bunch of people to come in and stand up
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, Hey, we grow it immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room gets empty.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My idea was maybe you could post something
to Craigslist where people are buying and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling grow equipment and just post your
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say, Hey, I'm, I've got veteran,
a veteran friend here who could use some
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any old equipment that
you're willing to donate, or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to throw it away or whatever,
maybe we could give it to this veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can Craigslist maybe a good spot to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe, maybe Facebook,
maybe you could start a Facebook group for
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans in need of grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or veterans cannabis Alliance or something
that's probably already taken that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out too naturally, but some sort of
veterans and cannabis and something to
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans grow initiative, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GI grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GI grow something like that to get
just to help get them some equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe post something to Craigslist,
maybe social media, like Facebook is
[SPEAKER_00]: always a place to start, start a group on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then go invite all of your veteran
friends, then invite, invite all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: grower friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know any of the two, if you've got
an overlap, that's a good way to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe, um, some of the dispensaries
and grow stores have message boards where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually make a note on paper and
put it on a bulletin board with these old
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call push pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places still have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of the music stores put that
in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look for a band, maybe some of
the grow stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can go to the grow store and
maybe put up a little flyer or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that saying, Hey, I know,
uh, don't throw away that old grow gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy a new gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw that old stuff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to a veteran in need and help a
veteran grow some weed or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just put your number on there or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can be the middle man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go collect all that gear and then
you just take it to the vets as they need
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe, maybe you can find some veteran
groups or maybe the VA hospital or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if it's a legal medical cannabis
market, a good place where I like to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast advertising and business cards is
the medical marijuana doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I go there, I make sure to
leave a couple of business cards there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know you can hit me up for seeds
and I leave podcast ads there because
[SPEAKER_00]: those are new consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting their cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're going to smoke possibly
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a good strategy or plan
for you, but I think social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: Craigslist are a great way to start this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then like Mike said, just build your
friends list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get out there and
let people know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can do a thing with the grow
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a friend at a local grow
store who you can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give a discount, maybe five or 10% or
maybe you get a free piece of merchandise,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little, you know, just a tiny freebie
that people can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they contribute their old gear,
when they buy new gear, like bring your
[SPEAKER_00]: old light, get 10% off on your new light
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can get a store to run a special
like that and help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got friends or
access like that, but that's when friends
[SPEAKER_00]: come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when stuff like this helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe you'll find that one of the
grow stores in town is ran by an old
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran and he'll be like, Oh,
that's an amazing idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's got the same kind of passion
that you do, Mike, I hear your stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: glitching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to slow down and let the
recording catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was your gear good buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to miss anything in the
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still good on my end.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Carl, I think we have answered your
question to the best of our ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do some
groundwork, maybe make some phone calls,
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, get out there and let people
know what your mission is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it starts happening,
it will snowball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once people know what you're doing,
you start building a following.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you got to do is get it
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it started, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go make a Facebook group,
create a Craigslist post, and then find
[SPEAKER_00]: people on both ends, needers and givers,
and then make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll feel really good when you get it
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for this, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for taking initiative and at
least having the idea and some passion to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this going for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure all of those veterans do
appreciate your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one could get kind of long,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's in for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
they legalized recreational cannabis here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Maine in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I've been very
enthusiastically trying to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I can about growing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep sucking it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I've enjoyed the plant
for a long time, but I was afraid to try
[SPEAKER_00]: growing when it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a risky move sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a job where I can listen
to headphones at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they legalized, I began listening
to podcasts about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the life when he could just put in
earbuds and just go all day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I first discovered your podcast
sometime around 2017 or 18 and began
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to blocks of early episodes on
YouTube to learn and pass the time while
[SPEAKER_00]: at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went as far back as the I Grow Culture
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the podcast first started,
I called it I Grow Culture, a play on the
[SPEAKER_00]: word aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Grow Culture and I Grow because
everything at the time had the I iPhone,
[SPEAKER_00]: I rig, I everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did get a message from a company
who makes educational programs for
[SPEAKER_00]: schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were called the I Grow Culture
Institute or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you can't do that
anymore or we will sue you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to change the name anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at episode 50, we changed the name to
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the I Grow Culture part comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're caught up on history,
it says, I heard your episode about how
[SPEAKER_00]: you name strains today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to the show,
a recent episode was about how I named
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on saying I found myself agreeing
with you that names of strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you give some thought to the
names you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had one piece of advice to give
people naming strains of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be try to pick something classy
and creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that stands out, something that
doesn't scare people away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often forget that the main demographic
of cannabis is 18 to 40 year old bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mostly who's smoking and mostly 25
to 40 year old bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up cannabis study,
that's who's mostly into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the fringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older demographic is getting larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lady demographic is getting larger,
but it's mostly bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: We forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to remember that there are ladies,
there are older folks in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is becoming a popular commercial
commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to not scare the ladies away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a close friend who is a lady grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me that she didn't like my stream
bounty killer because of the name bounty
[SPEAKER_00]: killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named it after a reggae artist who was
called bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it makes big fat harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, I wish it had a better,
more gentle name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we adjust, we may be able to get
more ladies, more older folk into our
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, if you're a senior, it may be
appropriate to name the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you what brand it
is, but if you're a senior, I'm going to
tell you what brand it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can name it, but if you're a
senior, I'm going to tell you what brand
it is.
If you're a senior, I'm going to tell you
what brand it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a senior seed breeder,
you're trying to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to broaden your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, try to pick something classy and
creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, don't pick names like green crack
or donkey dick or crystal math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green crack is kinda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear, if the guy who named green crack
had named it like strawberry starburst or
[SPEAKER_01]: some shit, weed would be legal in like
three more states at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may have been on more shelves and
more dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did get renamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name stood us back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perception is a thing and it's real and it
has legit effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if you ever hear the word the
mellow, that was green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They renamed it to the mellow after
Carmelo Anthony because green crack was
[SPEAKER_00]: his favorite strain is what I think I
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a weird nugget of cannabis info
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pick names like green crack or
donkey dick or crystal meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donkey dick is kind of maybe it made big
giant buds, but still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And green crack was called green crack
because it made little tiny rocks that
[SPEAKER_00]: were super hard and everybody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The donkey dick makes big buds,
crystal meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to ever type those
words together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody recently asked me if I was going
to make any COVID tribute strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, nah, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I make strains after things I
like like Ninja turtles and GI Joe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nursery rhymes after pandemics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will not be any COVID or any
pandemic strain names coming out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why honor that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, why would anyone want to compare
this wonderful plant with such a horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: drug like cracker meth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the name green crack actually made me
angry when I first heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still kind of pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it pisses me off,
but it does like rub me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear people say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just don't just don't say those
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I think names like this
work against cannabis being accepted and
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized in more places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't help those idiots to keep it
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you and I, you and this guy were on
the exact same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, don't give them fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to speak clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if I went up and said, bro,
they already expected that from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I started hearing good things
about green crack from some sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got me thinking that maybe there
were good strains out there, which I were
[SPEAKER_00]: avoiding simply because I thought the name
was stupid or silly thinking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there must be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that some strain names have
scared me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there were some great seeds that I
didn't buy just because the name was
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is definitely a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you agree with me that
it's very important, not only for
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing, and from a marketing
standpoint, but from a cultural and an
[SPEAKER_00]: observation standpoint, the people looking
in on us like, well, they like to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't fucking sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound good.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the anti-pot groups here in
Colorado has been desperate to get all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts, all concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to double crack weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been funny to watch them try to get
this to catch on for the last four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some shit just won't catch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other shit catches on right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't force it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Jodry calls dabs tree basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not going to set us forward at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The optics of dabbing are very,
very tricky to explain to non-consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you blessed out that dab
torch and you start heating up that nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like, we're going to get
stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to do drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wrap up this message with,
thank you for sharing so much of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing knowledge with the world
signed Jim Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jim politely reminds me that I
can say his name because that's just a pen
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sent me some pictures too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that arise, but look fucking amazing,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I addressed your question and
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I did, cause I completely
agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're breeding out there,
you're making strains, pick a cooler name,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to be drug related.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the names in the world out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go with something that's just going
to give it a black guy right off the
[SPEAKER_01]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you love it, do it, do your thing
player, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, I feel like I've covered
all of my notes for this episode of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to give you the opportunity to
read the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have anything that you'd like to
talk about today, if not, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to force anything and please keep it on
political.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not doing anything pandemic or politics
related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this has been my little Mike's
moment three or four times in a row,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I went herb shopping again at a bunch
of local shops and man, trim your fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if marijuana is legal where you're
at and you're wondering about how to
[SPEAKER_01]: attract more consumers to your business,
the trick is to put good products at
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable prices on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, I don't want to give away the
secret to business for free, but there
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking is people put good herb on the
shelf at a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you build it, they will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit focusing on random, crazy products
and weird advertising tactics and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy artwork on the sides of your
building and put some cool product on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf and we will come by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put good herb in the, put good herb on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's really all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I appreciate that insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was much different than what your
Twitter feed has been like lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you went that route.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my, my Twitter feed has been
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're looking for a more militant,
a militant version of white Mike,
[SPEAKER_01]: check out at NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we find you on Facebook?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been pretty quiet lately because
I haven't felt much like Facebook rant
[SPEAKER_01]: lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to just kind of stay off of
Facebook lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm flirting with being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've kind of stopped posting photos and
that's what I used it for was keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: family updated on kid stuff and family
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I stopped because I don't want to come
across photos of my kids using promotional
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising for products somewhere else
because that's how Facebook works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you have a Facebook account,
you're the fucking product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how social media works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been posting less and less,
especially imagery and yeah, it's evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go post random fish lyrics just to
let people know what I was listening to in
[SPEAKER_00]: the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually what that nonsense,
that four nonsensical words in a row,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually fish lyrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I post song lyrics,
I get three private messages that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, are you okay, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: We listen to different music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm avoiding social media because in the,
in the growing groups, I see the craziest
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the growing groups are just so
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to correct all of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just click back out and I'm done with
it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to a podcast and talk about real
stuff instead of trying to feel all that
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsense there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what inspired the outdoor episode
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I liked that
[SPEAKER_01]: the key to a good grow is planning and
prep work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, if you're going to grow a plant,
it's like growing anything else that's
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires daily active work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you forget about it or you don't
put a lot of effort in upfront,
[SPEAKER_01]: so your gear doesn't run right or doesn't
work well together or doesn't fit in your
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or parts of it don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to end up with shit and it's
going to cost you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put a little prep work into it and
do your research and then put in your due
[SPEAKER_01]: diligence every day, you're going to grow
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did the proper research and put
genetics that were worth the shit outside
[SPEAKER_00]: or in your grow.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I can't believe there's still,
like there's, there's so much information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you and me first got into
cannabis, there were one or two grow books
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were like mythical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reference I can think of from pop
culture is in the first American pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the book of how to fuck that they
have to go get from under the library
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like trying to find the anarchist
cookbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you had to take sketchy advice and
then the first internet forums like roll
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never knew if you were talking to
someone who was trying to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were talking to a competitor who
was trying to get you to fuck up yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you wouldn't eat up any market
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you were talking to a cop who was
trying to arrest you, you have no idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was so much harder to find
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who was trying to get you to fuck
up yourself so that you wouldn't eat up
[SPEAKER_01]: any market share.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what I have done on day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, you're already fucking up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already behind everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go to driver's ed before you
get in the car and stomp on the pedals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then three guys in the chat give them
like, you should top that you need to top
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to do anything for the cow
mag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of people that are like ad
piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why why?
[SPEAKER_01]: What what what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fucking getting rid of athletes
foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The solution to everything in Facebook is
either more Cal Mag or spray it with Neem
[SPEAKER_00]: or now it's Dr. Zime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Zime is the new one, but yeah,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that cracks my shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see posts that started off with,
I already had a Cal Mag, so fucking go to
[SPEAKER_01]: step two already.
