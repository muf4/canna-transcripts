[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning to noon or evening or
wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Umgyel Bilem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are listening to the Grow From
Your Heart podcast with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen with your heart or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is
time for episode 570 of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by GFYH10 while checking out at
[SPEAKER_01]: seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Angel's
Breath live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a blend of halo and purple
starburst.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the package, the flavor is described as
gas, floral and apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I crack open the jar, I am greeted
with that gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take a dab, that is when the
sweetness of the floral kicks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after I exhale, that is when a sour
apple flavor just lingers on my tongue and
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I should mention is that this
concentrate kicked my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a couple of fat dabs and now I'm
sitting here in mellow mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am super chilled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has got me nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 67.11% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the tremendously potent Angel's
[SPEAKER_01]: Breath live batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm going to read a few
emails and Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of the folks in the 710

[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I did include a link in the
show notes to make that nice and easy for
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not let me get too rambling and too
off track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into the first email for
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: They signed it one love from Zombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from our friend Zombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey bro, I had a quick question about
splitting a grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a room that is approximately seven
feet wide by seven feet deep and 10 ish
[SPEAKER_01]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a good visual of that in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently have a five by five grow tent
in the room and the wasted space is
[SPEAKER_01]: driving me nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've got a big room there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wasting at least two feet by two
feet each direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of wasted space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be doing a lot more
productivity, a lot more production in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, a lot more plants is what I'm
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would drive me nuts as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message says after much brainstorming,
I think the best solution is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: building a wall between the flower space
at three and a half by seven feet and a
[SPEAKER_01]: veg mother space at three by seven feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's an extra foot somewhere
there, but that mats out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think feel free to add your thoughts and
input on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought so far is that that doesn't
math up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a half a foot something somewhere
missing, but you're close enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's going to go on to say my
question, however, is about accessing the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one door to the room and I'm
thinking it should open into the veg space
[SPEAKER_01]: since, so there is no risk of a light leak
from my main area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Causing trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, that does make great sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will elaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend has a big room.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to divide the room into two
spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's thinking about building a wall almost
right down the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe leave one side, maybe leave that
flower space a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veg and mom side a little smaller,
but build a wall right down the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got two rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's wondering if he should access the
room through that veg space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veg space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can interrupt that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veg will be on more often than the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to run an 18 six cycle,
perhaps a 24 hour on cycle in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's walk into the grow through the veg
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep going cause there is
more to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, so my issue is that I have a
standard door in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to keep so much space clear to
physically open the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if you've seen anything in
your experience consulting low key grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: there would be a good substitute for a
standard door that I could maintain usable
[SPEAKER_01]: space in the veg and mother area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a couple of great suggestions and
ideas for my friend zombie here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that my first recommendation would
be to build a, just frame out a door,
[SPEAKER_01]: a wall in the room, make it just a crappy
frame, but we'll take a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some two by fours, build a frame,
frame out a wall, staple some poly to that
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got a brand new wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a lot of tools,
if you can't build a frame, you can staple
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can staple it to the walls and let it
hang, put a two by four down on the floor
[SPEAKER_01]: and wrap it around the two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll give it some structure at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it some support, some stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it stapled to the walls to the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it held to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should keep it in place depending on
how big this piece of Panda film is or
[SPEAKER_01]: poly or whatever you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd recommend, I think poly and Panda film
are just the same thing, just different
[SPEAKER_01]: words for the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get some thick Panda film, staple it up
to the ceiling, staple it to the walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you staple it, fold it to make a
little fold over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doubling up the thickness of
material, then put a piece of duct tape
[SPEAKER_01]: over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put the staples through the duct
tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got three pieces of material
you are duct taping through the ceiling or
[SPEAKER_01]: to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that weight of that poly starts
pulling down, it doesn't tear the poly
[SPEAKER_01]: right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll give you duct tape and two pieces of
poly worth of stretching before it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to tear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make a division, make a wall,
make a poly wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at most grow stores, you will find
one of my favorite inventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a zipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes rolled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long rolled up zipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take that zipper and you think about
where you want your door to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You unroll the zipper and it's got a
sticker on the back of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take it off just like you're putting
on a big bumper sticker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start from the floor and you go up
or you could start at the top and go down,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's easier to start at the floor and
go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, put that zipper right at
the floor and unroll it and work your way
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you unzip the zipper and take a blade
and cut right between those two pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when you're ready to close it,
your zipper slides up and down and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a zippered door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made a poly wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We built a, just a minimal frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of framing,
just enough to keep the Panda film
[SPEAKER_01]: supported, build the wall, then buy the
zipper Hydrofarm or other companies make
[SPEAKER_01]: this zipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sticks right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't explain it any better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a zipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come zipped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got sticky on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stick it on just like a sticker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You unzip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you cut right up the middle where
you zip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've made a separation and you
can zip that closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm explaining it the best I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks good in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't you see in my mind to see what I'm
trying to show you?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, jump in there for a minute,
get a free visual, then jump out because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's shit you do not want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've built a poly wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put a little bit of a zipper on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can enter that flowering room
through the veg space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you want to go into the
flowering room, make that the back part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go in there when the veg is on and
the flowering room is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure the flowering room is on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should never have to enter the veg
through the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing you should always follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's address this door question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did ask, how can I make some space for
the door?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a very good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned this from a, I don't remember
where I learned this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a really good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may edit that, I may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a suggestion for your door space.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've seen is most of the time
doors swing open.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've seen people do is make a
sliding door.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the door just slides over, if it just
moves to the side and doesn't swing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't get that whole swinging space
wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: However much square footage that is of the
door, the door is probably two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have that big swinging space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of space wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably put two, three,
maybe four, seven gallon pots in the space
[SPEAKER_01]: that it takes to swing a door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that that is valuable real
estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a sliding door.
[SPEAKER_01]: The door doesn't have to swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can put a sliding door there,
if you could take the door off and just
[SPEAKER_01]: pop it off and on in and out every day,
that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand this could be your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where you're doing this,
but a sliding door would save you a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the house doesn't have a sliding
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: That room probably doesn't have a sliding
door now, but in a lot of places where the
[SPEAKER_01]: homes are smaller, they don't have a lot
of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see that a sliding door is more
effective, more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: More economical might be the word I'm
looking for, but anyway, sliding door
[SPEAKER_01]: would help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say instead of dividing it by
50-50, I would say probably do 60-40,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 35-7.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the math there?
[SPEAKER_01]: 65-35, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know I'm doing math on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call it engineer math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Divide a little bit differently,
then build that poly wall, stick the
[SPEAKER_01]: zipper on there, and then build yourself a
sliding door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me make sure I answered all of the
questions in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I covered you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, one love from Zombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Zombie, big love, big respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear how this worked out for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if you were able to build
that wall because I did reply to Zombie
[SPEAKER_01]: with a detailed email, gave him some great
info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how that went for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to keep moving so I
don't get too rambling and get too off
[SPEAKER_01]: topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next message comes from, oh,
it says, my name is Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message comes from another listener
named Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I apologize and
the delay for thanking you for the pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never a delay and a thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world is busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I was able to help you out with
the pack of Sunkiss seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says they are perfect for me,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember getting this person a pack of
Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, we won't talk too much about
that, but you're very welcome for the pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they will work well for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it says, I've got a question for the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I see no difference in seed banks
that they sell CBD genetics and the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers are loaded with trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is that made out of if it's
almost no THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I think the question you're saying
is that you see seeds advertised on seed
[SPEAKER_01]: banks that are supposed to be high in CBD,
but they are covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those trichomes just don't contain THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant is not known to produce THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not one of the traits of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is CBD within that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown that seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't testify what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're saying what exactly is that
made out of if it's almost no THC inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of those trichomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not showing the presence of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes on to say, and they are
different density or shape or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're asking if CBD buds are any
different than THC buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is basically the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp and cannabis are basically the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, the main distinction between
hemp and cannabis is a lab test that tells
[SPEAKER_01]: you if that plant has point three percent
THC or higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's got more than that, it is now a
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be point three or point zero
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody will correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't look before I started the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bad habit of forgetting that
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something I need to pay attention
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is basically the distinction
between hemp and cannabis is THC or CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lab test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does one put does one express THC or does
one express CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also other cannabinoids that
we are learning about and discovering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not as prevalent and popular
at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hear about CBV if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be the next one that I predict
will be really popular and CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I see a lot of websites take and
use the same pictures for multiple strains
[SPEAKER_01]: and breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same website website uses the same
strain, multiple pictures, strains and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the one breeder is on multiple
websites, you should use the same pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you might be saying that you
see the same picture pop up on multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shouldn't be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly what you mean there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak too much on that without a
clear idea of what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I see a lot of websites taking you
the same pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is I was the man at playing
memory as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even seen it in a few grow books.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think there weren't as many
photographers and as many people taking
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis photography and doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people were able to be kind of
sneaky for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the industry has gotten more
transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A while back, everybody was just working
in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew who the breeders were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew what the growers look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew who the photographers were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was easier to kind of dupe people
and not be completely honest and
[SPEAKER_01]: completely transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully those times are passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you're going to start seeing
actual, real, legit photos of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some breeders will put pictures of
the mom plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get photos out early and start
selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak for what you saw,
but hopefully it doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the industry has changed with
all the transparency, with legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that shit goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That says you've also seen it in grow
books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've seen that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen, but hopefully it
doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting more integrity in the
industry is the word I've been fishing
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's more of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, second question is what brought
you to be a Rastafarian?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know very little about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was raised Baptist and I hit a certain
age and I couldn't pretend anymore to
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have no faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I was curious if you were brought
up with your beliefs or found them later
[SPEAKER_01]: in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me jump in here before I go too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: What brought me to Rastafari?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like most people, I was at a point in
life where I was looking for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know I was looking for something,
but there was a gap in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met a couple of people who were Rasta
and they taught me a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really drawn to one guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Ross Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always mean a lot to me, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a big shout out to Ross Bradley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two guys taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They influenced and inspired me quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of looked after me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't let me get too out of line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my line of thinking was too outlandish,
they'd say, bro, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd kind of reel me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross Chris was seriously, still is a heavy
practicing Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Brad is, he's got Rasta in his
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't follow Rasta so much now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to kind of adjust to a different
lifestyle, but those guys taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think being around them, being exposed
to Rasta, all of the right things,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the stars lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another Rasta saying it says he
who feels it knows it and I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and no, I wasn't raised around
Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our family celebrated Christmas and
Easter, but I don't think we went to
[SPEAKER_01]: church more than five times when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they believed in Christianity,
but they weren't Christians.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's like, they actively were Walmart
Christians.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were American Christians.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were holiday Christians.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be the way to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to be celebratory and whatnot,
but no, our family wasn't really faith or
[SPEAKER_01]: religious based.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of discovered that as a young adult
and kind of just on my own because of some
[SPEAKER_01]: of my friends and just being around my
friends and having a gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started, I knew that my life
was going well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that when I acknowledged the
good things in my life, I got more good
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started thinking job for those
things and listening to the guidance of
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastafari, those good things started
coming in abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still, still follow that every day,
give thanks for what I'm given every day
[SPEAKER_01]: and the good gifts keep coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I must be doing something right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want to hear too much about
religious talk on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't come here for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come here for growing knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the quick opportunity to
talk about Rastafari for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have asked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of avoided the question on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I became Rastafari because Ross Chris
and Ross Brad were really inspirational
[SPEAKER_01]: because I knew there were a lot of good
things going on in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it was pointing to Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been there ever since and it's never
gone away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where Rasta came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I believe your fans are not a
bunch of judgmental pricks and would love
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into what made Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that was a enough and not too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure some people got bored,
but Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I sure would too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the cannabis culture and
cultivation question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had more answers for you about
your CBD question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you were seeing the same
photo for different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just bad ethics and no integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully that shit stops and
Rastafari, I think I explained how Rasta
[SPEAKER_01]: landed on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we in this show?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about 19 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's knock out one more message.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from justice grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow justice underscore
grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice's question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Casey's question goes just like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey, Jeff, I learned about your
podcast via the grow cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've really been enjoying your grow
advice and other content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our buddy, Jordan River
for having me on the grow cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to return the favor and get you on
the show here really soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, uh, you said, uh, feel free to
email with questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you email with questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody else out there has a cannabis
culture or cultivation question,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I purchased regular seeds for the first
time, and I'm trying to figure out how and
[SPEAKER_01]: when to call the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing in a single four by four tent,
which I use for both veg and flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the Scrog method for plant
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see where we're going to run into
problems here.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I typically begin Scrogging
during the mid veg stage, and I'm assuming
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be able to identify the sex until
very late in veg or early flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously don't want to Scrog all of my
plants and then try to untangle and remove
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of males after they've grown into
the netting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any advice you can provide on how to best
resolve this issue would be greatly
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the great work you do from
Casey, also known as Justice Grows on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will get me talking for quite a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to realize that the first run with
the batch of seeds is not the production
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were thinking about growing big ass
plants, Scrogging them out, training them,
[SPEAKER_01]: spending a bunch of time on them,
and you don't even know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if you've got males.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if you've got
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if you've got bullshit
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to readjust our approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do a phenohunt and a finder run
before we do a big production run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to waste a lot of time,
if you just want to find the males and
[SPEAKER_01]: cull the males and get them out of there,
a real easy way to do it is to put the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants under 12-12 lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduce the lights to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them 12 hours of darkness,
12 hours of daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: In about 10 to 15 days, you will see sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants will show you if their boys
are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're boys or girls, as soon as you
have verified the sex of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: put the timer back on 18-6.
[SPEAKER_01]: If these plants only get about 14 days
into flower, it will not take much to
[SPEAKER_01]: revert them back to veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can put them under your Scrog
screen, spread them out the way you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to waste a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very quick and easy way to
determine sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just throw the plants right under
12-12 and they will show you if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: boys or girls, then put them right back
into veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take those boys out of there, spread those
girls out, get them in the Scrog net just
[SPEAKER_01]: the way you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another option is to cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've only got the one room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had two rooms, this is what I would
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would cut a clone from each of those
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would label the plants first,
plant one, plant two, plant three.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to name them fucking Carol,
Karen, and Eileen, you can do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but label them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then take a clone, make sure that the
clone is labeled appropriately,
[SPEAKER_01]: Karen, Carol, and Eileen, one,
two, and three, however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put those clones under 12-12
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clones will root and they will show
you sex within, like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 15 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those clones will start to grow balls or
they'll grow pistols and you can tell if
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got males or females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can throw the clones away,
go throw the big plants away, spread out
[SPEAKER_01]: those females.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since you have only got the one space,
I think your best bet is to put the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: under 12-12 lighting, let them show you if
they're male or female, then return them
[SPEAKER_01]: back to 18-6 or 24 hours of lighting,
whichever you prefer, whichever you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 24 hours of lighting will revege them
more quickly, but I think the plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: grow more happily with the 18-6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody likes a nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably kick ass with 24-hour days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I last a long time, but I will need a nap
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 18-6 may be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read back over the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure I didn't skip anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are all at the same point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say put your plants in 12-12 for
just a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you see sex, put that timer
back on 18-6, put that Scrognad up,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything will go just as planned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to keep in mind that
sometimes that first run isn't meant to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a production run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather you grow them small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even Scrog them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put them in there, turn them and burn
them and see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I understand that you don't have
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you do have amazing keepers,
you can't run it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in most ideal situations, we would
have a clone that we could run over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to run these seeds one time
and let them go?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you get the most amazing fucking
keeper plant out of this and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are both going to be heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you're going to have to learn
how to revedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want it more tense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want more tense really,
really soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as grows, my advice for you is to
put those plants under 12-12 lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: until they begin to show you sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you see sex, pull the boys out,
put the girls all back in that 18-6
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, throw up the Scrog net,
grow them into the Scrog net as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: the net is filled, flip them into flower,
put up another net.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you know what to do from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
