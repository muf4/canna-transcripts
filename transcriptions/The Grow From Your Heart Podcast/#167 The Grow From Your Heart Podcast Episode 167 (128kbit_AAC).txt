[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 167 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_04]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_04]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host, my friends, Kwame Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys once again for
joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Kat, the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I almost got through that whole thing
without coughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to cough right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys did not hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have snuck that through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good coughs, but shout out to my buddy
Frosty Organics for bringing some frosty
[SPEAKER_04]: gorilla glue over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: A newcomer, someone who has not been on
yet, but I promised him our no-till guest
[SPEAKER_04]: is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, Frosty Organics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Been waiting to be on here for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been listening to this for a few
years now, so appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I said message me and we can have
you show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute that episode came out,
you sent me a message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, hey, dude, I want to be on
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was super pumped.
Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about no-till,
obviously, today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to introduce another newcomer
sitting across from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy is visiting from ... Are you
visiting from North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's sharing a mic with Will, so he's
going to have to kind of lean in a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit, but he's visiting from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, our new friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say Logan, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just told your name once and I
remembered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff, is that your name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good to meet you, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in from North Carolina,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is not legal there, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this some culture shock to be able to
come out here and just drive around with
[SPEAKER_04]: weed in the car?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, honestly, I've been smoking since a
very young age with old Will over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing weird to me because the taboo
is broken for myself, but to be out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so much more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always this looming impending
doom, but North Carolina is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalized too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get pulled over with weed and
you're not acting like a total jackass,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to cost, I don't know,
$250 to $500, but it's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's better than going to jail,
but you never know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you feel like taking a dab or anything,
man, reach over, grab any of the shatter,
[SPEAKER_04]: any of the rigs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to load one up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, here's a dab on this dab,
or if you want to take that man size dab,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't hurt yourself or do.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys heard me mention him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying so hard not to cough,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been taking mad dabs over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friend from Barefoot Extracts,
also the Barefoot Growers, across the
[SPEAKER_04]: table from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Barefoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we call you Will?
[SPEAKER_04]: Call you Barefoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barefoot, Will, whatever you want to call
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That beard is coming in manly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting a lot of compliments on
it lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you trim it up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you even it out or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, every couple weeks I'll go through
and kind of hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of get the loose ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That last evening gave it a thickness,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's manly now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little ... You're about to raid
some villages or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just might.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going to talk about no-till,
but before we get that far, I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: thank these guys for joining me because
they've been here for like an hour and 20
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes and all we've done is take dabs
and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for taking time out of your
evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in a water bottle and be like,
I'm high and having fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you got kids, dude, so thanks for
coming over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got a garden and a life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I need to give a huge shout out to
my friends at thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need some new genetics for your
garden, some feminized or regular seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: check out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them know that you heard about them on
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, shout out to our friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some cool shit coming up from our
friends at Handmade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I owe a huge shout out to my friend
Task Rock at Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other day, I went to the mailbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't feel worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate something that kicked my ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I was not living, but I went to the
mailbox and I opened up the mail and there
[SPEAKER_04]: was a gift in the mail from Task Rock and
Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the new, it's a quartz and titanium
combo domeless e-nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, domeless, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I still say domeless.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day, you guys, we used to put
a dome on the dab rig, but it's a titanium
[SPEAKER_04]: nail with a quartz dish with a little
protective titanium shroud, I think is the
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate word.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a shield around it so that you
can carry your quartz nail with you and
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have to feel as paranoid like
you're going to break it because I am a
[SPEAKER_04]: breaky guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to break glass shit and I will
break a quartz nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a quartz nail that I will not
break.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is able to be attached to my
barrel-style e-nail coil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it much more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better on my flat e-nail coil and it's
also able to be used without the e-nail
[SPEAKER_04]: setup as just an on-the-go nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a sweet product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I like it a lot better with the
flat coil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to end up being used
mostly with a torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it as much with the barrel
coil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't heat up the way I wanted it to
heat up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take globs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would work for you probably,
but everybody over here was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: your nail is hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all making this, everybody that
hit my e-nail is looking at me like,
[SPEAKER_04]: your fucking nail is hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: My throat hurts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time Will was here and he kind of led
on a little bit about no-till growing and
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, elaborate, and he said,
you got to get Frosty over.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got Frosty Organics over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should ask Frosty a couple of questions
before we do that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have you been growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really growing, like for real
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say a little over two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've just been getting at this and
you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably closer to three years,
but really figuring out what I was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing it correctly, I'd say about two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long into your grow career did you
decide to go no-till?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've been at the no-till for like a
year?
[SPEAKER_02]: A year.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're good at it, bro, because that
Gorilla Glue 4 you brought, that is frosty
[SPEAKER_04]: as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It lives up to your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: My soils get at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I like the way this guy thinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're making, where'd you get your
soil recipe?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy that I've been following for
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Coot on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clackamascus Coot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clackamascus Coot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clackamascus is old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clackamascus is old school.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you said Coot, I thought that might
be who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really into like K&F, like Korean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Korean natural farming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really, everybody I think that does
no-till is like basically based off of his
[SPEAKER_02]: soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took his soil recipe and then just
added our own things into it, but he's
[SPEAKER_02]: really like the founder of no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since we're talking about who the
founder is, tell us a little about what
[SPEAKER_04]: note, what's the difference between
no-till and what most of us are probably
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of us are probably going to the
store, getting bottles, mixing shit up in
[SPEAKER_04]: a shot glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weighing it out into a bucket,
pouring it in, mixing it up, make sure the
[SPEAKER_04]: pH is right, and then pouring that onto
our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So teach us a little about the difference
of what no-till is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no-till is just basically kind of
like living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living soil is basically a super soil that
everybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody got into an organic way and
they're like, well, you can feed just
[SPEAKER_02]: water to this soil and your plants will do
what it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically all the inputs in your soil
is doing what it's supposed to for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like in nature, you don't see anything
in nature doesn't get fed with a bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already in the dirt and it eats it as
it's supposed to and get to what it wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It breaks it down naturally because the
decomposition happens from other things in
[SPEAKER_04]: the earth and the worms and poop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then that's available as needed by
the plant and the plant isn't force fed
[SPEAKER_04]: basically or starving for anything,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was doing super soil there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super soil is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes your soil is too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put too many amendments in it or
maybe the amendments that are in there for
[SPEAKER_02]: deep in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you might've put your soil together
a little bit before you threw it into
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, you know, a late in veg or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might've transplanted into your five
gallon right before you threw it into
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might start getting too heavy of
newts, you know, or I guess natural
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments being broken down and feeding
your plants too hot and it'll burn your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the, the way to get away from
that is, is to just the natural way with
[SPEAKER_02]: no till is to have basically the same
thing, but then we have like compost and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we have, you know, worms in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't put worms in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put earthworm castings from a guy
here in town named Don.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has the greatest earthworm castings
ever, but it has cocoons in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those worms will come to life after
like, you know, a few days actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, it'll have little worms in
there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, little bitty worms and stuff in
there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, once they start getting
fed and stuff like that, you just need to
[SPEAKER_02]: have mulch on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause what you want to do is you want to
keep, uh, basically you want to just keep
[SPEAKER_02]: your, uh, your, your soil very,
very moist on top just because you want
[SPEAKER_02]: your worms to come to the top and to break
down all your top dressings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever you do a transplant from your
one gallon, so usually in a one gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: when I veg, I just use like some shitty
soil, you know, um, something that's very
[SPEAKER_02]: base, you know, you could use pro mix if
you wanted, you know, I mean, if that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what you chose, I use more something that,
uh, you know, shout to Don again,
[SPEAKER_02]: Don makes a base soil for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put my plants in there in one
gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've edged them with just water only just
for like a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three weeks after that, I put them into
their, uh, their new pot and then I've
[SPEAKER_02]: edged them for a week in their,
uh, in their no-till pots, but their
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till pots are already working and
already already inoculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about what goes into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's talk about what goes into that
no-till pot before we put the plants in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how long before I put my one gallon
pot into that no-till do I want to get
[SPEAKER_04]: that mixed up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need some time to let it get cooking?
[SPEAKER_04]: You do for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make it on your own,
um, you can buy a soil mix now that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, is basically Coots mix, um,
plus all the extra things we were putting
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for a few years, you know,
we were having to, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: make our soil mixes and put all these
extra things in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we started buying like a soil mix on
build a soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still have to put extra things in
it, you know, to make it exactly what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want it to be rich enough to be able to go
all through flower and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: to have your worms and your microbe life
and your beneficial is really working,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, after, after we, uh,
you know, we're doing that for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he came out with a, it's called the
modern mix version 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has, uh, um, what is the compost in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from, um, Malibu compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only heard good things about those
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The richest compost I've ever used.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing bad I've heard about them
is it's hard to get sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very hard to get.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very hard to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Must be good shit then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Jeremy started making, uh,
a super good soil though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I've used his soil, uh,
a few times now on, uh, a few new pots
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've had to put together on some new
rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but all my older pots that are like
four or five rounds in, I built those like
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we, we mix the compost, we mix the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to, you know, mix, uh, each
amendment and, you know, one cup to each
[SPEAKER_02]: cubic foot, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to, you know, had to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, I guess you'd have it sit
there for maybe like a week or two,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then you would just, you know,
put everything in there, put your top
[SPEAKER_02]: dress on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, put your, your earthworm
castings in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd put your, uh, your, your cover crop
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just let it come to life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by the time you put your plant in
there, it's already working and it'll just
[SPEAKER_02]: overtake your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you even put shitty soil in there,
it'll overtake that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can start with old shitty recycled
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I like to take my old soil that
plants have already been in and I will put
[SPEAKER_04]: clones in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clones, if you got a clone from me,
chances are it came in recycled soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was treated.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no bugs in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been flushed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how good your clones look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can start in shitty soil if you're
going into no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got it set up about a week in
advance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to put water in there after
we've got all the nutrients and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: amendments in there and the soil in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to water it a week in advance
or do you just want to let it sit kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you want it moist or do you want it
kind of dry?
[SPEAKER_02]: You should water it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely water it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll get it kind of moving in there
and get all that going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get everything congealed together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your beneficials eating and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, uh, whenever we put those earthworm
castings in there, they definitely already
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of beneficials and stuff in
there working with the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, just it's so rich that
that shit's so rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes so fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gives it to us fresh out of the compost
of the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got it going on over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know another guy that had something
similar and I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get them, get your pots loaded
up about a week in advance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, check out the modern mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might want to add some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, check out sub cools, uh, super soil
recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way he throws a tarp on the ground and
mixes the super soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just using a different mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the modern mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find your own recipe on making some
no-till soil and perfect it for your
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get a good start with the modern
mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like, but your plants are going
to want different shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need to protect,
uh, perfect it for each plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is a good start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, then get your plants into there about
a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, after you make the mix, then you said
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to keep mulch on top to keep the
worms feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to use for mulch?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use old stems, you know,
um, old branches and stuff like that from
[SPEAKER_02]: old harvests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I take the leaves that I'm
lollipopping?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's food already available for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cut the cover crop as it's growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cover crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I growing as cover crop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of clover clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta think lemongrass will keep bugs
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're growing lemongrass right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's keeping bugs away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask about some pest
management and no-till here in a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: seconds, but it sounds like we're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemongrass.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can I use to keep the pests away
on my no-till crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, eucalyptus, uh, rosemary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those types of essential oils.
Time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, natural stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't really spray a neem oil on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Karanja oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has a more milder smell and it's,
uh, it's, it's easier to, uh, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: to fuck with, you know, it's just easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about neem oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we, when you said it, my face
wrinkled up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something if, if you get a tiny
drop of neem oil on anything, it feels
[SPEAKER_04]: like I can taste it for a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even if it gets on my hand,
I can taste it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that sounds crazy, but it
doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most terrible flavor ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but yeah, I've used plenty of neem oil
on stuff, but okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically essential oils will help you
keep your pests away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow the lemongrass in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works as cover crop and it's going to
keep some bugs out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the basics to get you started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do we need to think about?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got mulch, we've got cover crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some good hot soil to keep us
cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically you're just growing now,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to water them when they're
thirsty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watered, do some top dresses, top dresses.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to use for top dress?
[SPEAKER_03]: Worm castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're going to do some,
uh, some neem meals, neem seed meal,
[SPEAKER_03]: neem seed meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of words.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: A neem seed meal, kelp meal, a biochar is
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, worm castings, some fish compost is
real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alfalfa meal is real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, uh, like those, right when you
transplant, get a like fresh dose of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen right to them right when they're
transplanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like kelp and sea products
completely add to the flavors and aromas
[SPEAKER_04]: and density a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a neem and kelp tea, every like other
watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever foliar feed with your teas
that you make?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't really make teas anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's just more about just top
dressings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like whenever you go into flower,
um, malted barley once a week.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of enzymes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sugars, you know, stuff like that will
make your buds real sweet, make them dense
[SPEAKER_02]: up and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do a lot of, uh, potassium
silicate too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just still 16 H.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just make my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just make my own, uh, you know,
liquid of it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been using the bottled OSA.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still a baby over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I say 28 is good though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I used to use that whenever I was
doing super souls and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like build a soil gets a lot of
free shout outs on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of, they've got everything
you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they have everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just click on their website and
you can literally build a soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a question, they've got a
chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a regimen for everything on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so basic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, man, we can get, I had one of my
basic questions here is how do we start,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you go get some modern mix 2.0 and you
get some pots filled with it and you water
[SPEAKER_04]: them and you grow some clones and then you
throw it in there and then you pay
[SPEAKER_04]: attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next time you're going to
have to add amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got our mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our cover crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we've taken care of our pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically we're flushing the whole time,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not, not flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're basically just feeding your worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you're just feeding the worms
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about the worms in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the worms are, are shitting,
you know, and then the beneficials come
[SPEAKER_02]: and break down the, the worm poop and the
worm poop turns into a hummus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now at the end you cut down your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, do you just dig a little hole?
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to that stock and put your next clone
right in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you getting it started again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just rip your root ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just rip that sucker right out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to get as little, you don't want to
take the root ball out, shake it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get as little dirt out as
possible because you don't want to add any
[SPEAKER_03]: new soil to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to just keep using the same soil
over and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing you want to add is new
amendments and new top dresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compose.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you needed to add more like soil or if
you transplant and needed to add something
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually transplant, you just put
compost and earthworm castings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, yeah, I would just fill that hole
with worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love doing that when I transplant,
just put a nice layer of castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll throw some, some great white shark or
something in there and get that moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what are you going to re-amend
it, re-amend it with the second time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, worm castings, compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top dress is really, it's less of a
re-amendment and more of just top
[SPEAKER_03]: dressing, refeeding everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neem kilt biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the cover crop going to just keep
growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like a perpetual thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cut it, it grows back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll, it'll, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff that you cut off, can you throw
that into a tea and make kind of a compost
[SPEAKER_04]: tea out of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using comfrey and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just usually use it as mulch on top of
the top though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys don't go to the grow store
anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardly, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even if you wanted to,
you know, make your own, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically like if you want to push your
plants extra hard, you can use like
[SPEAKER_02]: Calphos and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make your own calcium and
phosphorus, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like all these processes are
super sustainable, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially once you get to like a certain
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just, that's great for your
soil anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're just like building your
own little like ecosystem, like out of
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the major problems of home
growing is that when you're done,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got all this trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got sticks, you've got leaves,
you've got dirt bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even think about the bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bottles you could throw in the trash,
but it's all that dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I grow, when I used to have,
I had an old trap house where I would do
[SPEAKER_04]: like 20, how many did I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's 28 seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a lot of soil when you're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would have to find somewhere smooth
to throw all that away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And luckily I have a friend who grows an
outdoor vegetable garden and I would just
[SPEAKER_04]: have him come pick it all up in his truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would just haul it off for me in
the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I didn't have that hookup,
what am I going to do with 28 seven gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: pots worth of soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't even have to worry about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your worms just go and they're like,
oh, you need new dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got you covered, Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and then you get to throw your sticks
in there and you're also composting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys run into Bokashi bucket?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I love my Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like to make some fermentation
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can make fermented fruit and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like super beneficial for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like you hang out with Sean a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you use a lot of aloe vera in anything
you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a lot of the plants love that
stuff, don't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's and coconut, the coconut water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a lot of enzymes to help break
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love drinking coconut water myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel super hydrated and I feel like if I
feed that to the plants, they've got to
[SPEAKER_04]: feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my favorite.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff that comes out of the Bokashi
bucket will break down all that old stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we actually just started using that at
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not out of the bucket, but we just started
using the Bokashi at work to help break
[SPEAKER_03]: down compost on our beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll speed it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll give you that white funk layer too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that beautiful mycelium layer that
people get afraid of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy, he just started growing
organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is his first time ever growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He decided to go in at organics and he got
a nice layer of mycelium on his plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: he sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I think I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: My plants got mold on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, dude, you're doing it
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, oh, okay, now I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, I get it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my shrooms and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People freak out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it on Facebook or Instagram every
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh shit, my soil is making shrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just exactly what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just the right humidity and the
right fucking pH in there to where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing shrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, that's going to fall apart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to fall apart back into the
soil and your plants going to eat that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do anything differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wrote down how cost effective is
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it's a one-time deal,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you got to occasionally buy more
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have to buy some more neem and
kelp meal because I do neem and kelp teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just do those every third watering,
I think, and then as top dresses as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on how much you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the soil goes, yeah,
it's basically a one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not buying seven bags of soil every
time you need to do transplant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 28, seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just still there moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you don't have to...
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a lot of work, but it also
sounds like it's saving me a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the long run, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to go to the grocery store
and buy bottles, which are expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a lot of... I'm paying for the
water to be shipped, it feels like,
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially, because I read the
ingredients and all that shit's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: It build the soil in a dry form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the difference between like
potassium silica, like we were talking,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you get pre-mixed potassium silicate in
a bottle, it's going to cost like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 10 times more, if not more than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what the bag of the powder comes in
and you can make 10 times as much that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes in the bottle with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you got me rethinking everything I do
and... Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a gallon with 568 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: A potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: 148 grams a liter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like... I mean, that's simple,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I wish I could... I want to start off
just like one or two pots of some stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: and just see if I can see what it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Run it next to my botanic hair grow or
whatever brand I'm using, my Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it'll kill them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll overtake them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll probably even see, you'll probably
even see beneficials might even hop into
[SPEAKER_03]: your other soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get your other soil hopping that
well, if it's really going... Because
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll want to go, they're going to want
to spread out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to want to go to where
they're going to be needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to just move over to the
other pots and be like, oh, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: you look lonely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can help you get rid of some PM if you
have anything in there, the good,
[SPEAKER_03]: as Frosty always says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's plenty of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lactobacillus serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a buddy that had some other plants
that got some PM on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you want to get rid of
that real quick?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just took some lactobacillus serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You spray that for three days and it's
completely gone because beneficial fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: overtakes bad fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a farmer's tale about PM being
systematic and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not systematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went through his whole flower period
and had no PM whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: PM can be a real bitch sometimes in
Colorado when the temperature changes here
[SPEAKER_04]: and it changes every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had to cut down rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was about to say yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were wearing shorts and I was like,
it's too warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had on shorts and a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now today I woke up and I was like,
it's cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's snowing and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hoping on Friday, a little brag
here, I get to go see Joe Rogan at
[SPEAKER_04]: ComedyWorks Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just hoping, don't snow until
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't snow until Saturday.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it fucking got me on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I jinxed myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Baker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to a lot of comedy shows and Joe
Rogan is probably one of the few that
[SPEAKER_04]: really get me super pumped.
[SPEAKER_04]: After you go to as many as I go to,
it's like, yeah, I'm going to a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rogan and Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got lucky enough to see Diaz also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_04]: 26 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems like you guys both follow the
T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_04]: book quite a bit as a good way to get
started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you recommend the T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_04]: book from the ref?
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever grown any of his seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like he puts out some good seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't grown any of them yet,
but I've got a pack somewhere that I
[SPEAKER_04]: should grow, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure he's grown fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been doing it for so long that he
better have the fire by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the rev.
[SPEAKER_04]: They made him change his Facebook page to
his real name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really weird seeing all these
people's real names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the rev.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_04]: book, True Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the other book that he did that I
did not write down the name of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody went blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the rev.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out his cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Teaming with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the book I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the rev also?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not the rev.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not even weed guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just about soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll check out Teaming with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll teach you how to keep your soil food
web rocking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: first because Teaming with Microbes is a
little bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really beginner information.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have kind of an idea of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it'll just go right over your head
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It skips a lot of basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to Google all the basics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So read T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: T.L.
[SPEAKER_03]: is a great one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you get a good handle on
that, you think you have an understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: of how organics work and you want to dive
a little deeper, open up Teaming with
[SPEAKER_03]: Microbes and learn about the soil food web
because that's where No-Toe really comes
[SPEAKER_03]: into play.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soil food web because that's what's
happening inside of your soil is you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got a whole ecosystem of microorganisms
living, breeding, excreting, feeding your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, definitely, definitely check both
of those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other books you two would recommend
while you're talking about books?
[SPEAKER_03]: Teaming with nutrients is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit less about organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same guys that did Teaming with
Microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've skimmed through that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've skimmed through it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just more, yes, it's less organic
based.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't want to do the full
organic ride, which I understand some
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't want to do it, check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll kind of give you a good,
a little bit better understanding of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on in your soil with your
nutrients and bottle feeding and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys ever get any of your No-Till
products tested by any of the labs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't yet, but I want to really soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think me and my buddy were going to go
up to Springs to, what is it, CB1
[SPEAKER_02]: analytics or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: CB1, shout out Nate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they reputable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you give them a name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, CB1, shout out Nate.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Colorado Springs, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know there was a testing facility
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they do like the
pesticides on it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted them to do a full analysis just
so I could just show how food great our
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is that we don't spray no
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could test it all the way down and
it's just going to be a pure cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd love to see the tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see what kind of THC,
CBD, CBG, CBN.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's coming out on the No-Till.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just smoked and saw your product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm high as shit
from smoking some of Frosty's Frosty
[SPEAKER_04]: Gorilla Glue 4.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trichomes were really short and all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't look like they got really tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like they were fighting for
space in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's just me, the way I
feed my plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it was Frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were fighting for space in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got good and heavily medicated on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we talk about where people can acquire
some of your great smokeables?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something you feel like you want
to mention on the show?
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, I could totally hit a little bit
of editing and take this part right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our friends at the Canna
Canyon in beautiful Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I carry a lot of my product over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could say I'm kind of a co-op
grower for them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They carry my product there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a member there, you can go
reimburse my product there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the streets and stuff like that,
personally, that's not my thing and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Canyon is what I was shooting for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: People from anywhere, if you're 21 and
over, you're able to come to the Canna
[SPEAKER_04]: Canyon in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Colorado Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot think of the exact address.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 1505, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1507.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will's going to search for me while I
ramble on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to the Canna Canyon in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're 21 and over, if you've got a
valid ID and you're not an asshole,
[SPEAKER_04]: we invite you to come to the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please sign up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join as a member.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sign the member agreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the address, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I nailed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1507 West Colorado Avenue in beautiful
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Parking in the front is kind of a bitch,
but parking in the back is available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go into the alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to park diagonal in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's near the 7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see the 7-Eleven, go across the
street.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have an ID.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sign the member agreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chances are I might be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deb and Granny might be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will might be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty could be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're only in town for a few days,
but shit, by the time this episode comes
[SPEAKER_04]: out, my new friend Logan could be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm there taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: The traveling stoner is there all the damn
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camille is there all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the dogs, but you can also
grab some flowers that were done by our
[SPEAKER_04]: good friend Frosty here that are totally
organic, that are beautiful, that are
[SPEAKER_04]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time I was there, I think they had
some of the Gorilla Glue on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a crowd favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't stay long.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get busy when some stuff comes
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a huge shout out to the Canna
Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys can write the checkout to Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to plug myself, you can also find
my extracts on the shelves there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to give you a shout out for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It said on the little parchment paper that
it was 27 point something grams when you
[SPEAKER_04]: dropped it off is what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, it was nowhere near 27 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: People would eat that shit up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it was popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been telling me it's been selling
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're happy with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been being reimbursed for quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's something if you do go to
the club, the Canna Canyon or any of the
[SPEAKER_04]: clubs, learn the lingo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please say the proper shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the proper terminology, nomenclature,
whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reimbursed however it goes there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know sometimes it feels silly,
but that's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we've covered most of No-Till
and it sounds like this is a perfect segue
[SPEAKER_04]: into something else that I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, in Denver,
Colorado, they voted yes to allow
[SPEAKER_04]: consumption of cannabis in adult places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some bars and clubs will begin allowing
people to smoke cannabis in certain
[SPEAKER_04]: sections indoors in places.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means we're going to have social
lounges in Denver very soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure people are looking for buildings
to rent right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are already places that function
kind of illegitimately, kind of under the
[SPEAKER_04]: radar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those places are probably going to blow up
and be popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or there are people out there right now
looking for property, painting the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to a couple, just like Springs,
I've been to a couple that are really
[SPEAKER_04]: nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Canna Canyon, the couches,
they went to a nice place and bought brand
[SPEAKER_04]: new couches.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bought a rug that matched.
[SPEAKER_04]: They went with the paint on the walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a table with end tables that all
matched.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a shelf that's the same kind of
wood as the tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it looks like somebody really,
they had like their gate interior
[SPEAKER_04]: decorator friend came and helped him out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a competitor that's very near
there that looks like they got all of
[SPEAKER_04]: their shit at the fucking, the thrift
store down the street and their fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: dog laid on it for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly won't let my dreadlocks touch
that couch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't let my dreads down in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep my dreads tied up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't let my backpack out of my site in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the Canna Canyon, I'll go take a piss
and leave my backpack and my rig and my
[SPEAKER_04]: hash on the table because that's crew in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's family.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the homie place.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other place, and there are other
places that are in the middle and above
[SPEAKER_04]: and below that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some where I won't even take my
backpack in because I feel like I might
[SPEAKER_04]: get jacked for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some that are so damn loud
because the band is playing constantly
[SPEAKER_04]: that I can't even be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to be able to have clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope somebody does it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be some cool places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't all have to be reggae lounges,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't all have to be dubstep bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool if Chiva Hut was like,
if they let one of their places,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they turn one of their places into
Smoker Friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: How cool would that be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not both of them, but if they did
the Colfax one, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a smoking night at a bowling
alley?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you need to get, if it's a
permit or a special license you'll need to
[SPEAKER_03]: get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if it's one of those things you
can be like, hey, can we get a permit for
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday night so we can allow smoking?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all hypothetical now, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all shit that is going to come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I preach this all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're writing rules in your area,
write this shit in so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: to sit here and make it up right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you don't write these rules in
your rulemaking, old people in suits that
[SPEAKER_04]: don't give a fuck about cannabis,
that don't take dabs, that don't go out,
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to write these rules and it's
going to suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can get like, you get a liquor
license.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pay for a year of a cannabis
consumption license so that every night
[SPEAKER_04]: after 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: you can consume cannabis in your facility
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, from nine to two, nine to three.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way at two when you got to collect
all the drinks, you take some dabs and
[SPEAKER_04]: hang out and socialize.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way nobody ever gets in a fight,
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got something to say, pass him a mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my thought too is what about if you
bring your own dabs to these places,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that going to be allowed?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically the way it's going to
work with our marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_04]: division system.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mostly the way it's going to have
to work is a bring your own cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they'll cut the loophole out of
that one pretty quickly because they've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen how it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've seen how it works down in Colorado
Springs with the loopholes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they'll probably make it so
it's like, all right, there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'll make it pretty clear that
there will be no money handed to anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: for anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it a barcade as a theme.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to the bars, you get drinks and
play video games.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't drink, so I just stand there like,
I like Supernova in Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of stand there like,
this is fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can play some Street Fighter and all you
fucking drunks are spilling beer on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I would like a beer,
but unfortunately I don't know how to have
[SPEAKER_04]: a beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to have about 20 or 30 beers,
so I just don't drink at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot better for me because I'll have
a beer and then somebody will be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you want a shot?
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I do want a shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then do you want another shot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I don't know where the fuck I am
or where my money or my car is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I drink a lot of shots and there's
just no line for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I choose not to drink at all,
but I can smoke like the best of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wish that while all my friends are at
Supernova drinking and doing shots,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, I have a fat joint in my hand to
play some Street Fighter too, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw some Sonic booms in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get an email plugged into the side of the
arcade machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be badass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be up there playing some Tekken and
slaying it all night.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody open up a, so that would be
the way to have some video games,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe some laser tag in there or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, this opens up, yeah,
the Ganja Gourmet can go back to their
[SPEAKER_04]: original format now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to be able to go smoke at the
Ganja Gourmet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just go get some really good food and
smoke too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super heavy food and smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that would also like bring OSHA in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just with smoking, you know, because smoke
is like banned, like I think nationwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's state to state or county to
county.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the Clean Air Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not supposed to be able to smoke
in places.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if that's why I was saying you could
get that yearly liquor license,
[SPEAKER_04]: that cannabis consumption license,
it would probably break that, give you
[SPEAKER_04]: that rule override somehow, your card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure like, again, like once the
taboo is just broken down, like in these
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurants and places, you know,
people just aren't going to care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine like by the third or fourth
cannabis night at the bowling alley,
[SPEAKER_04]: bowl night at the bowling alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be like, dude,
this snack bar fucking crushed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've never sold so many nachos ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was peaceful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there were a couple of dudes who just
stood there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They paid for their bowling shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fucking stood there and stared at the
lane moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They turned the black lights on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I see in my mind too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be the manager of bowling alley
that used to do the black light bowling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could see it all in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could have just smoked in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything would have been better.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had so many fights in there because we
served tons of alcohol and you turn on
[SPEAKER_04]: music and you got music, girls,
and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the three things that
eventually add to a fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're dudes bowling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, raw, I got to strike raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guys next to them got a gutter
ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're like, Oh yeah,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why they're going to fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw it fucking once a week in a bowling
alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're trying to fight,
hit this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the worst they pass out and
problem's all there anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why was I trying to fight you again,
dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got good weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just become best friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love that we had a really serious
lesson on no-till and then we turned it
[SPEAKER_04]: into whole chatter, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People that are from other states like
yourself that don't get to be here and
[SPEAKER_04]: involved in this kind of love to hear us
chatter about what it's like to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I get messages like, bro,
it's like hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like freedom for some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to listen to the podcast back when
I lived in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember it kind of being like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes like, man, it sounds like it's
cool over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like when that was when Maddie
and Spence would come on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Maddie and Spence.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to see those kids doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I met you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it weren't for Maddie and Spence,
I wouldn't know either one of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I met you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I met y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Missed those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're all grown the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like everybody that I know for the
most part I've met either through this
[SPEAKER_03]: that I haven't met through work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've met through them or through somebody
I met through them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you from, Frosty?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never knew that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I assumed you were from North Carolina
just because everybody else that I met
[SPEAKER_04]: through Spence was from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually, you know, I met Spence a
long time ago whenever, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the greener side was still open and all
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually met him through Hank and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I've known Spencer for,
you know, quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gardner Weedon crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_04]: He posts pics of that little kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I get tired of seeing people's kids
on Instagram and on Facebook, but goddamn
[SPEAKER_04]: Hank's son's a handsome little G.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude's going to be a pimp,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, hide your fucking
daughter because Hank's kid Lucas is
[SPEAKER_04]: coming to get her.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's coming to get him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a pimp.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a baller.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a handsome little devil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He dresses and looks just like daddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's a little micro pimp.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got anything else that you want
to say on a podcast since you've got a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole lot of people listening to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to smoke, you know,
the terpias, you know, the tastiest,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoothest, cleanest cannabis that you can
consume, you know, go organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to heal somebody,
if you're trying to get rid of cancer,
[SPEAKER_04]: or if you're trying to take care of people
that have conditions like Crohn disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: Crohn's disease, or possibly an autoimmune
disease or anything that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: take care of, you don't want to give
people shit medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to give them quality medicine
that is actually medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want to take shit into their
bodies, they just go get pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd go to the pharmacy and get some
pills and get some poison.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please let's not poison people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not spray stupid shit on our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing with bottles,
I'm not hating on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow with bottles, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to use Botanicare Pure Blend Pro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done plenty of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organic as fuck stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: My lifestyle and the way that I learned
how to grow, I'm really comfortable with
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys kind of inspire me to step
outside the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may see me do some attempts at some
no-till stuff, but we're not hating on
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are growing with bottles,
do me one favor and flush heavily for at
[SPEAKER_04]: least 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 20 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a longer strain,
go ahead, flush for 20 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your leaves start looking a little bit
yellow, you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get mad at some yellow leaves at the
end.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means a plant is using up the
nutrients that it needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now time to come down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it's fall time, what happens?
[SPEAKER_04]: The leaves change colors and they come
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plant is saying, it's fall time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's when you should cut it down and take
care of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about the rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one more thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say to anybody that hasn't
started, I meant to say this in the last
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that hasn't started growing yet
and if you want to get into growing and
[SPEAKER_03]: you think you eventually do want to get
into organics and you think it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: smarter to learn with bottles first,
I would advise you just go ahead and jump
[SPEAKER_03]: straight into organics because it's two
totally different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll learn how to grow with nutrients
and be like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to switch to organics and it's
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to buy so much different shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know you want to do organics,
just go from the get-go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go no-till because in my opinion,
it sounds like no-till, it's going to cost
[SPEAKER_04]: you a little bit more to get started.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to buy worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need Modern Mix 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need to get a head start
on yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you're buying something like
Advanced Nutrients or Mills or Psycho-
[SPEAKER_03]: You're buying bottles every week,
bottles every month, and that adds up real
[SPEAKER_03]: quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get yourself some no-till and you're
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You only have to buy it once.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that first harvest, you've paid for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
Easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get richer and richer and richer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Round 30 is going to be the best round
you've had.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to get better and better and
better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to think it's going to be
like the forest or like the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest plants in the world are in the
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the richest soil in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, your soil is going to be
mimicking the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's undisturbed out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing fucks with it except nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much humics in there, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things die and things decompose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely with compost on top of just
any style of growing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just recycle all vegetables and
stuff and even bits of food, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: really get those worms eating and fatter
and healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all just feeds itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It churns itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there ever be a point when I have too
many worms in my pot?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's just self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they regulate themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They multiply relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised at how fast you get a
good bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they also regulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know, OK, there's only X amount of
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I don't really know the lifespan on
a worm, but I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some of them die off and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: They decay.
[SPEAKER_03]: They become part of the humus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have nutrients in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They become food also.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: In TLO, I think the REV actually gives a
nice little setup on how to make a worm
[SPEAKER_04]: farm so that you can make your own worm
castings from the worms as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get that going.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be fully sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the worm castings in your garage
because it does kind of stink a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to feed it calm, but it's
mostly what you put in and it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: stink.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a vegetarian, so I'm throwing in
avocado peels and apple cores and the tips
[SPEAKER_04]: of the strawberries and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be super rich, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super rich in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My plants loved it when I was feeding them
that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were sweet and sticky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I shouldn't even tell you how many
people listen, but within 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_04]: releasing this, episode about five
thousand people will download and listen
[SPEAKER_04]: to this between iTunes, Stitcher and my
website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I'm available on like seven or eight
other podcasting applications that I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: even pay any attention to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people are going to hear this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate you guys coming and
helping out the growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate you having us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to get you guys on.
[SPEAKER_04]: People love to hear this type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely information people need
to know because this is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always talk about end of the world
scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are going to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be at rating hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need the last bit of the bottles because
it's all going to the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can do this with this is no till
work with a lot of other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not just weed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No till with basically anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to do top dress and amended a
little bit differently depending on what
[SPEAKER_03]: you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, end of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no till you've got a sustainable
garden out front.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will be growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be making a raft out of bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
