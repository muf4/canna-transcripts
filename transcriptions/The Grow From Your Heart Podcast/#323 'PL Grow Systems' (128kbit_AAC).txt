[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 323 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
look no further than the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is also
brought to you by my friends at PL Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A responsible gardener knows what's
happening in his grow room at all times,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can monitor your temperature and
your humidity from anywhere with the new
[SPEAKER_00]: Minder unit from our friends at PL Grow
Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at PLgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very
special Thursday episode of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my friends Peter and Lee from PL
Grow Systems joining me on Skype,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're gonna talk about the PL Grow
Systems units, and then we're gonna get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of moments I had to
edit because Skype was getting choppy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, I think the show
sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, let's get right
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live on Skype, here are my friends Peter
and Lee from PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, gentlemen, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pressed record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got you guys on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to the show, Peter and Lee from
PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell us exactly where you guys
are from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I first met you, I advertised
that you were from Australia and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, especially seeing as I'm originally
from South Africa, being linked with
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the right hemisphere, wrong country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But originally from South Africa,
now living in England, being here for 20
[SPEAKER_02]: plus years for my sins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm originally from the home of Durban
Poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in London.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here for a good 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of great things,
but I have never been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worth a visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely worth a visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I've got somewhere to stay,
so I'll come see you guys.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, you guys are to stay when
we head that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously, Peter and Lee are PNL
from PNL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you guys like to take a minute and
tell me about how you got into this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of creating the PL Grow Systems products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I lose you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something may have gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I think where I was, I was just
going to give you guys an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me about the company, since you guys
are obviously Peter and Lee of PNL Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to tell me a little bit
about how PNL came about and what inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: you to create this company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it started off with us both having
the same problem that if you wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a two week holiday, you'd come back
to a bunch of dead plants either in your
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse or your grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, we went and had a look in the
market to go and see what was out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that would allow us to keep an eye on it
and remotely control it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was nothing within our price
bracket, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's some really expensive
bits of kit out there that can do it for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether you can even remote into them
is optional.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually would require quite a bit of
reconfiguring your home or your routers
[SPEAKER_02]: and firewalls to let traffic in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being technologists, we just decided
there's got to be a cheaper way and easier
[SPEAKER_02]: way of doing this and started building
systems for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started off with some early prototypes
that when we started posting pictures of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, people took interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was after slowly building it up and
showing what it could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And controlling our own setup,
that interest grew and grew and grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we suddenly realized, hang on,
we've solved the problem for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: This ability to make it really easy to get
up and running and be able to access it
[SPEAKER_02]: from anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other people are interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, that's really how the
company came about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We solved the problem and realized that
there were others that wanted the same
[SPEAKER_02]: solution at an affordable price.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing about it was the remote
access and making it easy to set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've both got decades of IT support
within the financial world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to make this thing as easy as
possible to reduce the number of support
[SPEAKER_02]: calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made the fatal mistake of offering my
father IT support in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, trying to make things as
simple as possible to keep the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: calls to a minimum is part of what we try
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not simple, then we realize it's
going to be a problem for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody is a techie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's key to what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our devices, you literally connect them to
your Wi-Fi network.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to configure anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything happens super simply through
the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite parts about it,
is the simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that I didn't have to add
anything to my computer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I need is happening for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can access it from anywhere
in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's my favorite part that I can
see my grow at home while I am at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to drive home and check on
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is completely simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite part is that I don't
have to come here to look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just check right on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at the cameras on one app.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at the minder on the other app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know everything is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other units I've tried to use,
I've had problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, I plugged it in and it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've tried to keep it nice and
modular as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first unit that we've brought out
is the one with the sensors with ambient
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and humidity and another
temperature sensor that's waterproof that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can drop into your reservoir,
for instance, or you can put it into your
[SPEAKER_02]: grow medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was using it out in the greenhouse to
check that the soil temperature was up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the right temperature before planting the
chilies in the greenhouse to prevent root
[SPEAKER_02]: shock, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then because it's modular and you tend
to find that most people just want
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 is a nice to have, but only really if
you're running in a sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your average home enthusiast and home
grower is not necessarily doing CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: enriched environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can, well, we are, we do have a CO2
sensor coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is another modular piece that you
just add in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you don't have to change
anything on your setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to buy a whole new piece of
kit to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we just need to buy the sensor,
but you don't have to upgrade anything
[SPEAKER_02]: software wise or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is great for people who just want to
add something later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if they can't afford the system
right at the beginning, they can add on
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of having to invest in the high
price unit right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great addition there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build it up slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to make it as accessible for
everybody as possible, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a vapor pressure deficit reading
available?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we do that as a calculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the website, one of the outputs that
you get, which is calculated on the fly is
[SPEAKER_02]: the VPD readings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that you can then look at for free
what we give to everybody that comes with
[SPEAKER_02]: each unit when you buy it, you get free
access to your current readings and then
[SPEAKER_02]: two hours, four hours, six, 12,
24, 48 and seven days worth of historical
[SPEAKER_02]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look at over time what's
actually going on in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we take a reading every 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fairly granular as to what's going
on in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see if somebody's opened the door
and closed it again, because you'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature spikes up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see when the fan came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay enough attention, you can see
when each fan kicks on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a number of clients who've
actually said that being able to see that
[SPEAKER_02]: has one of them identified that the fan
had sucked some plastic up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they knew the fan was supposed to
be on and they couldn't see the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they went to see what was wrong with
the fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And others have realized, oh, hang on,
I haven't turned the heater on because
[SPEAKER_02]: they can see when the heater was supposed
to kick in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly they don't see the temperature
actually coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had an air conditioner fail and
I would not have known without the minder
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked to see what the temp was and it
was really high in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I hadn't looked, I wasn't coming
home for more for another four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four or five hours at that
temperature, I would have not had a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was worth the investment already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that people don't...
When we come onto the whole environment
[SPEAKER_02]: control and monitoring of the environment,
we listen to lots of podcasts and they
[SPEAKER_02]: often talk about all the nutrients and the
lighting and all of that, which is all
[SPEAKER_02]: good and well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the environment is off,
it doesn't matter how good the lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: is, how good the nutrients are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's 45 degrees centigrade and 10%
humidity, everything's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lets you grow in cacti.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not surviving that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem with your run of the mill
hygrometer is that it gives you the
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum temperature that it was at and the
minimum temperature was at with no
[SPEAKER_02]: indication as to how long you were at the
maximum and the minimum temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just a blip?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you there for 10 minutes or was it
four hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the extra information that
we provide and it gives people their real
[SPEAKER_02]: insight into what's actually going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that most of the swings
happen right when the lights go on or
[SPEAKER_00]: right when the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the next hour is when things really
go different and you're never there for
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what's happening in that
grow room when those lights go off for
[SPEAKER_00]: that hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really neat to find out what happens
with your lights, your temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: your humidity, your vapor pressure deficit
in that hour swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most interesting part in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really neat to get something like
this and be able to chart what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can start to do things like
plan to actually have fans come on 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes before the lights come on to sort
of reduce that bump as the lights kick in
[SPEAKER_02]: and give everything an opportunity to
start up before the lights come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same when the lights go off,
you can actually stop things extracting 10
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes before if you're running in a
really small space where if it carries on
[SPEAKER_02]: extracting, after lights have gone off,
it cools down too quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might say, well, just before the
lights turn off, turn the fans off and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll stop extracting and then just that
general sort of ambient cooling that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens can reduce that drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've already mentioned several ways
that these things are going to improve our
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already mentioned one great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet getting into the States has been a
huge jump for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, precisely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's where we see there being a
really big market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, it's not kid
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you look at it as the as the
gold rush equivalent, as it has been
[SPEAKER_02]: named, you know, the green rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: During that time, everybody, all the gold
miners had to have mining equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they were successful or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this is basic equipment
that gives somebody the edge in the green
[SPEAKER_02]: rush that allows you to be able to have a
much finer view and control of the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that market there, the fact is
it's all the home growers and they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: missing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can go and spend three, four
thousand, which is really pricing them out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the market for, you know, an equivalent
ish system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours comes in at just trying to do the
exchange rate conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our basic entry unit, the minder,
which doesn't have a screen on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is ideal for like large,
but for really small home users as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way through large gross spaces
that need to have lots of sensors hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to screen on all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just small units.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the sensors hanging off them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We retail them for 70 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that's affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what about one hundred and
twenty dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about one hundred and twenty U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely affordable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going and, you know,
and then you get all that data on the
[SPEAKER_02]: website and we can and we add analytics
over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have enough customers who say we'd
like to see this, we can just add it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't require applications or
software on people's phones, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's beautiful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen in the short time I've been
working with you guys, I've seen vast
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little it was very new when I was
introduced to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it looks like a professional
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like one of the major companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like NASA now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's come a long way since we first
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it started off the approach is the
same as we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the product range is it starts off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do what it needs to do and then
worry about making it look pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's the first step is is
making sure it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in this industry, that's exactly
what it says on the tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this industry, too many people did
that backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to make it pretty and then
figure out how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you make a solution and then try and
find a problem for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've told us about the the 70
pound unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the other unit you've got available
for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other one that we have is the
Minda Plus, and that has a screen on it
[SPEAKER_02]: and that retails for 90 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about 150 dollars, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still very.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nice thing about that one is if
you've got a sealed environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: for instance, you can mount it on the
outside and then have the leads running
[SPEAKER_02]: into into the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could have one on the outside that
you can see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could hang a couple of the
other Minda units without the screens
[SPEAKER_02]: within the space if you wanted to monitor
more more areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how how many square feet would you
recommend I hang each unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far apart would I need them?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a large room, how many would I
would you recommend per square foot or so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I guess you do a meter there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a good question,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, each sensor by default,
I mean, each unit by default comes with
[SPEAKER_02]: two and a half meter leads, which is about
seven feet, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do them up to much longer leads as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do up to 10 meters, which is about 30
feet.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really comes down to how tight
somebody wants to be measuring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hang two in the house, that's three
meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's two of the ambient ones and one
at just each end of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: A certain amount of that's going to depend
on how much airflow you've got moving
[SPEAKER_01]: around the room as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've got one in a five meter by
four meter area, and that gives me a
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively good a good consistent reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably five meters square would
probably be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could possibly go a bit louder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I say, it depends on how much
airflow you've got going around the room
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite a large space to monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's pretty impressive for one
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected less space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most homegrows are going to be able to
would get away with just one unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I think most of the customer
base does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably get away with one,
maybe two and almost all of my larger grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you can also do with them,
I mean, a little sort of a nice bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is probably more relevant to the US,
actually, because you've got multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: times zones, which we don't have here,
is you can actually set each device to be
[SPEAKER_02]: in its own time zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're looking at the data,
you're actually seeing it relevant to the
[SPEAKER_02]: local time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not having to do a mental
calculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had grow facilities,
if you if you own, you know, multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities and you wanted to actually keep
an eye centrally on what was going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: each one of them locally, in local time,
we support that straight away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's something that I haven't
necessarily seen on others, but I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: really comment too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like when he has a plane flying
overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed, there's plenty in each hour.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these two products, the Minder
and the Minder Plus, they're our entry
[SPEAKER_02]: level products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the ones that we've gone to
market with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real sort of the crown jewel is
the controller unit, which allows you to
[SPEAKER_02]: control humidifiers, dehumidifiers,
fans, AC units, heaters, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: by in response to readings from the
sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes with four four sockets and
we're close to launching this in the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had a number of early adopters
who've taken this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where we also the US market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it gets really
interesting is now the ability to automate
[SPEAKER_02]: the controlling of an environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the humidity gets too low,
then it'll fire up my humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it gets to the right temp,
it'll turn that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it gets too high, it'll put my
dehumidifier for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's we can all use stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Automation is key and commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, for the home grower where,
which is the target market with the
[SPEAKER_02]: technology being able to scale up in terms
of what it can control in size and
[SPEAKER_02]: magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dehumidifier, probably in the States,
like a $50, you know, those three liter
[SPEAKER_02]: humidifiers that only turn on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's switch it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell it how fast it needs to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about the only control you have
over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't tell it to cut off at different
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want that, you're spending like
$500 on a humidifier that will know to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn off at 75% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there's a huge price
difference in those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with ours, this now allows somebody to
take their 30 or $50 humidifier and make
[SPEAKER_02]: it perform like in terms of functionality,
like a $500 humidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's helped turn on and off only when it
needs to come on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a price point in mind for that
unit when it's ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the UK, we're looking at 400 pounds for
that unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound like a high number,
but for something that's going to turn on
[SPEAKER_00]: and off my devices, well worth the price
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more affordable than a major
controller from a lot of the larger brands
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that also be controlling the lights
and all of the HVAC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can tell it to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It operates as a standalone unit as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just had it completely standalone,
it is like an agricultural timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will do lights, pumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when you then link it to one or more
of the minor units that you get the
[SPEAKER_02]: additional functionality of, okay,
I understand that's the humidity in that
[SPEAKER_02]: space and it's connected to, this plug is
connected to the humidifier that runs over
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to turn it on or turn it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a great unit,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to get one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, that's what we're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for the interest from the US
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a business perspective, there are
opportunities clearly over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking to work with whoever we can
to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different regulations in terms of
electrical and all sorts of fun and games,
[SPEAKER_02]: I must say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great fun starting your own
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you get to design a product and
then master it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before you send it to us,
you have to redesign it because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to redo a few things, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are 37 different plugs all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going for a truly global
market, you're going to have one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: got 37 different plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far into it were you before you
realized 37 plugs were the option?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think we were fairly committed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to buy all 37 plugs to figure them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate the work you've put
into it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When can we expect the controller unit to
be available for the US market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if everything goes according to plan
over the next few months, we're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: looking towards building around about
early next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would much rather err on the side of
caution than overly optimistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if there's any of the right investors
who happen to listen to this podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you get in contact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them, since you're plugging yourself,
tell them how they can find you if they do
[SPEAKER_00]: want to reach out at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can contact either myself or
Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their email address is Peter at PLGrow
.Systems and it's Lee at PLGrow.Systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on Instagram, it's at PLGrowSystems
and our website is PLGrow.Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are any investors out there
looking to get into the business,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a great opportunity and they could
use your support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, for the US market in
particular, we've got some particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting ideas to leverage my and Lee's
experience within the finance world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some interesting things that can
be done all of a sudden with the US
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just speaking about that,
looking at it from over here, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely crazy to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inspirational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any legalization coming your
way in your guys' area?
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting mixed bag because
there are some economists who are saying
[SPEAKER_02]: within five years because of how much the
rest of the world is changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it was White Mike or
Guru on the DGC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show who said what coast to coast sales,
it's now exceeding equivalent or exceeding
[SPEAKER_02]: cosmetic sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a big industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that was Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're up into the 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought so.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're up into the 50 billion dollar
market, yeah, the rest of the world starts
[SPEAKER_02]: to think maybe it's not so evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, no, it won't make you crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, no, it's all OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, yeah, I think it's interesting
to see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money does talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said the same thing at the same time,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money does talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money's got the loudest voice in the room
every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they lose the tax on cigarettes,
they're going to go, shit, need to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that'll be your guys' way in
because I'm sure that when they legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in your area, you will be in
every grow room because you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, over here we've got, you know,
we've got giant veg grows who are using
[SPEAKER_02]: the system in their outdoor and their
allotments over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a whole interesting market
here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for anybody who is in the
UK who is interested, NPK technology is a
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic shop up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably quite happy to speak
about their experience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using it in their lab at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said NPK technologies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check them out myself just
because I'm very interested in what you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a great podcast and a YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had Mammoth Key on, I forget the
guy's name from Mammoth Key, Mammoth
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had him on a number of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a guy from Great White.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great podcast to check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really good, really good,
interesting podcast to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, over here, it's interesting,
you know, to cut back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I find when we've spoken to investors
here, as soon as you talk about the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: market and the analogy with the gold mine
and, you know, the gold rush and the green
[SPEAKER_02]: rush and the gold mine equipment supplies,
and that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're in that you know, incendiary
support business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't touch the product at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't process it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got nothing to do with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm looking to build into the
system going forward is the ability for
[SPEAKER_02]: your home grower to be able to select a
strain from a database, see what the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders flowering time is and what the
average users flowering time was.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can select it, sell the system,
and that's what I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting it on this date.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to budget for four weeks and
then cut over to flower to whichever the
[SPEAKER_02]: reader or the average user flower time,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really make it easy for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the system will do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will just do the lighting schedule for
you, for instance, and they can set up
[SPEAKER_02]: their pump schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where the pumps are linked to the
lighting schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you change the lighting schedule,
the pumps will automatically adjust.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've said never come on when the
lights are off, instead of you having to
[SPEAKER_02]: go around and change 15 different pump
timers because you've changed the light
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule, it just automatically updates
itself and follows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to save a grower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a guy like myself who has 25 fans to
go change, they've all just adjusted
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to save me time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you're talking about VPD,
well, yeah, that's the other bit that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes into play is as the lights go off,
temperature comes down, humidity goes up,
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD plummets, for instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if you're humidifier,
even a $500 humidifier, well, I guess $500
[SPEAKER_02]: humidifier, it doesn't know that when the
lights go off, it needs to drop to 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity, just as an example, from 75 to
50.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the lights are on, you need to keep
it up here because of the increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the lights go off, you need to drop
it because of the decrease in temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's something that this is
the software that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it says for the controller.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is to be able to tell that I want
for the first five weeks to have a VPD of
[SPEAKER_02]: eight and for the next 10 weeks,
VPD of 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the system just takes care of it for
you in terms of monitoring temperature and
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to save me a lot of time,
a lot of energy, a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go in before the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can set up what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can just know that it's all
going to happen for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to ask one of the grotesques
to make sure to turn something down or
[SPEAKER_00]: turn something off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to prevent a lot of error
because humans make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we've taken that out of the
computers and they're not going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that we've
implemented as well is that you can set an
[SPEAKER_01]: alert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, if your temperature does go
above a particular level or humidity goes
[SPEAKER_01]: above a particular level, you'll get an
email that tells you that it's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a chance to go and intervene
and you'll get one of them at the moment
[SPEAKER_01]: every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way you get reminded that there's
a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a chance to go fix it before
any damage gets done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can get in the car and drive
right over there and unplug those lights
[SPEAKER_00]: before they roast my plants.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, better still, really what you can
do is you can just go to the website and
[SPEAKER_02]: tell the controller to turn the lights
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to get in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a standard feature you get with
the minder as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of the minders, other than just
recording your data, you can also set your
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum and minimum temperature and
humidity and you'll get emails if it
[SPEAKER_01]: breaches either of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even have to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just say, turn that off until I can
finish recording and then I'll go over
[SPEAKER_00]: there and fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a shop's perspective, what's kind of
nice is somebody can now walk in and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got a problem with the growth at
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can walk into the shop and they can
actually show the guy behind the counter
[SPEAKER_02]: the data that they're always asking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your temperature and humidity been
for the last week?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they can show them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of just standing there looking
at the guy gormlessly like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hot and not very humid, not very accurate,
they can actually show them the data and
[SPEAKER_02]: get a far better analysis of what may be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the consumer's point of view,
spend less money on trying to solve the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem because they get it right the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe reputationally wise from the
shop's perspective is that they're giving
[SPEAKER_02]: the right advice first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the products are available online if
people want to go look for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can find you at PLGrowSystems,
is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: PLGrow.Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: PLGrow.Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the minder plus and coming
soon, the controller unit will be
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the pressure is on you guys,
because I just told everybody that that
[SPEAKER_00]: controller unit is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys got to get in the workshop
there and start soldering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you've been in the workshop quite a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of early adopters who've
been running it and are running it at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment to help us make sure that we're
going down the right line with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From everything I have seen, you guys are
going down the right line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The improvements on the website have been
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upgrade to the second system that you
sent me was obvious the minute it came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one was much more sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see that you guys are improving
every time we do business together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's noticeable already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, gentlemen, it feels like we have
sounds like you've got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking some time out of your
day to be on the show with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we've covered all of the
business part of the podcast and of the
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to call it an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like hanging out with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you guys would like
to say while you were on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you'd like to put out there while
you've got a microphone on you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would just like to say a big
thanks to everybody who has actually
[SPEAKER_02]: helped us so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a case of hard work and
dedication to it, but it's also loyal
[SPEAKER_02]: clients and fans who have helped support
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds a bit cheesy, the fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there are some people who have
gone way beyond what we would expect in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of helping to promote us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's respectable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be dedicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support of people like yourself,
Jeff, has helped us get a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's encouraging us to do what we do and
we're loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate the opportunity to work
with your products and make friends with
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an honor to be involved in
something from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got one of the very first
units, I feel like I got to see come a
[SPEAKER_00]: long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for letting me be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for trusting me with your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for letting me advertise for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of products, we need to ship
you the two new, the newest design ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send a couple over and we'll throw
in an extra minding unit that you can give
[SPEAKER_02]: away as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure my listeners, my listeners are
already drooling for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already waiting to figure out how
we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll set up a giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that more than you even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to make everybody really
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be good, you know,
I'm just putting it out there on to the
[SPEAKER_02]: other grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, well, it would be good to hear
more about, you know, what are the best
[SPEAKER_02]: ways of maintaining an environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the tricks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it changes, you know, you know,
there's small environments where people
[SPEAKER_02]: are growing in spaces that are three feet
by two feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that keeping that regulated compared
to something that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30,000 square feet is a very different
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even up to 10 by 10 foot,
just an idea, you know, that whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it changes and what are the tricks for
being able to try and maintain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what are the ideal temperatures and
humidity is because this is where VPD gets
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting because it can kind of throw
conventional thinking out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you said that because the
next podcast I have written is all about
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go from VPD and then we'll start
talking about more environmental controls
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfect timing, great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we've noticed is in our
simulations, we've only got a small little
[SPEAKER_01]: set up at the moment, but once we got the
VPD dialed in and we managed to maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on our charts, you've got the maximum
ideal VPD and the minimum VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've managed to keep it pretty consistent
between the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within three days, you can see the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are just, they're more turgid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're praying up more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a significant difference when
you can keep it in that zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for the sake of clarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the minimum and maximum suggested
VPD is precisely that it's suggested.
[SPEAKER_02]: We highly recommend that you look into it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before committing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a minefield.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a leaf size and shape
difference may affect your desired VPD is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, gentlemen, find out what,
what the target numbers are for you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's what you go from ours is
purely an indicative minimum and maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a, like a hydroponic
lettuce versus, uh, something that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I don't want to say cannabis,
but versus cannabis, uh, you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: vastly different desired VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your plants and make
sure you dial it in for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no hard, fast rules when it
comes to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, gentlemen, I'm going to,
yeah, we can chat for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up the, uh, the podcast
portion of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for joining me
for a really long hangout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks for all the great information
on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press stop on the recording
and then we can just hang out and chat for
[SPEAKER_00]: a few minutes if you gentlemen would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll press stop so that way you don't
incriminate yourselves anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
