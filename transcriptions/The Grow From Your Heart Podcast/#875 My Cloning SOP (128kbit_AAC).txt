Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's show, I'm going to talk about
taking clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about cloning in an easy
cloner, and we'll also talk about cloning
[SPEAKER_01]: in a clone dome environment.

[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to waste too much time
advertising here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the cloning portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in this episode, I'm going to say the
word clone a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, maybe I should
explain what I mean by the word clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: A clone is a perfect, exact copy of a
plant that you already have or a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that already exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say you've got a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant originally came from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got it from the seed that you
grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe another person took a clone of that
seed and gave you that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you have now got a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps you want to keep that plant
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bought that clone, you know it's a
good clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to preserve that and keep that so
you can grow it generation after
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we do it in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how myself as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I keep specific plants around
to breed with them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about my golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had golden goat since probably 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that plant from a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept that clone in preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I grew out the other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that clone got bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took clones from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always kept one back as a mother plant
in preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quickly, a clone is a copy of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a cut of that plant and then you
put that cut into a solution and then into
[SPEAKER_01]: an environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, that cut will make roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an exact photocopy of the original
plant that it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very useful because like I said,
I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I keep my golden goat plant
around since 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the math on however long that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, like I said before,
the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a clone of it or I take multiple
clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those clones will go into the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what the plant that I just took
the cuts from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I cut all of it down and made clones
out of all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the big plant went outside and got
to flower outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those clones go into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always grab one of them and put it in
the bedroom, the mom room, and keep it as
[SPEAKER_01]: a mom for preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always got that golden goat mother
plant in the mom room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it gets too big, once again,
we take a bunch of clones, pick the best
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That becomes the new mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep that in preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: By keeping that plant under ... Most
people will go 18 hours on, six hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do 19 hours on and five hours off of
light in my mother room to keep my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feed them basically vegetative
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what we're here for today,
but that's where all this starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mother out that plant is what the
phrase is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're taking cuts from it,
that plant just becomes the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the clone donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the mother or the clone donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're now taking clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That becomes your new clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've covered the mother plant
start of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next note here is emphasize the
importance of healthy, pest-free mother or
[SPEAKER_01]: donor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what a clone is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that mother plant or the
donor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the plant where the clone is coming
from, the plant that is going to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant needs to be stress-free,
pest-free, powdery mildew-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more healthy that mother plant is,
that donor plant, the more optimal success
[SPEAKER_01]: you have, the chance for success you have
for your clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more healthy your mother plant is,
the more chance you have for success for
[SPEAKER_01]: your clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to talk about genetic
drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a full episode on genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetic drift is not a real thing when it
comes to cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, however, transfer diseases,
pathogens, problems like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but genetic drift does not happen at
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a full episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some research on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quickly, when you read the
definition of genetic drift, you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: that it cannot happen when we are cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy, happy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A clone is a genetic copy of that original
happy, healthy mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all the basics out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into actually how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this SOP is posted on my Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a link in the show notes and
in the video description.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to see this typed out,
mostly typed out the way that I read it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did modify it to make it readable for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in a very rough draft form on my
Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you join the Discord server,
some people say it's messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the stuff on your far left or the
servers are a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember of then click on the iry army
server.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take you to my server.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all the tabs on your left are just
different tabs and categories in my
[SPEAKER_01]: server.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs will say clone care SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is clone care SOP, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be there in text form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can print it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can save it to your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that is there for free to share with
the public because I want you to have
[SPEAKER_01]: great success in your clone game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got good skills, good success in my
clone game, good success rate with this
[SPEAKER_01]: SOP, and I want to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come to the Discord server if you need
this printed, if you need another form of
[SPEAKER_01]: this, it is there for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Discord doesn't cost you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The membership doesn't cost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: To join my server is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: To come hang out in the Smoker's Lounge is
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get this SOP completely free,
free freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that SOP is on Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I got something in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know I've been rambling for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time to talk about the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where we're going to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we need clean equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend just brand new scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get a pair of new scissors,
get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get a couple of pairs of
scissors, get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are worried about hop,
latent, viroid at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe clean your scissors between every
single plant if you're doing multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing an OG Kush and a Blue
Dream and a Purple Haze, clean the
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors with bleach between every one or
use new scissors between each cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sterilized equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sterilize your table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sterilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about the EZ Cloner
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sterilize the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sterilize your scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to talk about the EZ
Cloner here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the EZ Cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a Turbo Cloner, an EZ Cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care which brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the same for whatever brand you
are using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sponsored by any of these
companies involved in this podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only people that I haven't an
advertising deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So EZ Cloner, Turbo Cloner, whichever one
you prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plug-in machine that sprays water up
from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses the neoprene collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sterilize everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have already used this machine,
replace or sterilize the collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say that this machine is
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend sterilizing everything
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least use hot water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run some hot water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even some bleach through this
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then whatever you clean it up with,
get all of that out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a fresh clean machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fresh clean neoprene collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using the Permaclone collars,
you can sterilize those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other brands I do not recommend
sterilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend replacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, we've got a clean
machine and clean collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need to be able to plug
this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be certain that wherever you're putting
this, you can plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe plug it into an extension cord,
which I don't recommend, but make sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get it plugged in somewhere from where
it is sitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're going to do, you're going
to get this thing sitting on a level safe
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how big it is, you may have
to fill a lot of water in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure your table is nice and
sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now fill the clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the halo in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little spray manifold with the
sprayers on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure those have been cleaned as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about that more later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But put your little sprayer inside of the
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill that reservoir up right below the
halo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we want a lot of water in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to last as long as it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that pump is going to heat up the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more water that's in there,
it'll help it keep a little bit cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill it up right to the bottom of that
halo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to put clone X solution
inside of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow stuff, not the purple shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use the purple shit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, we're going to use the
yellow stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big bottle of clone solution,
not the clone gel, the clone solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put the clone X clone
solution into the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to EC this solution to an EC of 1.0
to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.0 to 1.2 is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got water in the machine,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your pH or your EC meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your EC meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing EC today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got your EC meter already dipped into
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start pouring the clone X solution and
give it a stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the size of your machine,
how much water is in there, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to need more, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm telling you to go to an EC
instead of how many milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pour it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pour it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're at about 0.8, 0.9,
really start pouring super light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that to 1.0 to 1.2 EC of the yellow
clone X solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a good stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the top on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plugging it in is going to make it fucking
stir real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unplug it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your meter back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what your EC is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too high, you can add water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it didn't go too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too low, probably too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add a little bit more solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filled it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we put some solution in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now pH that cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use pH up or pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably pH down at this point in most
cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH that to 5.7 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frustrating pHing these cloners if
you're new at this because when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: really close, you'll think I need one more
drop and you'll put one more drop in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's going to throw it way the fuck
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick sidetrack because I'm good at
sidetracks and rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH scale doesn't work where one is one
and two is two and three is three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not recall the name of the scale
because I did not do research of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is how the pH scale works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just follow me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One on the pH scale is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two on the pH scale is basically 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three on the pH scale is 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't go up just by one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes up incrementally by a digit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You move your decimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add a zero every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody with more of an organic chemistry
degree, somebody that understands that
[SPEAKER_01]: better, go ahead and type how that works
exactly in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct me if I'm saying that incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it flies so much when you get
closer to your target if you've gone up or
[SPEAKER_01]: down because it's adjusting incrementally
when you add that one more drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that one more drop is kind of turned
into 10 drops once you've gone far enough
[SPEAKER_01]: up the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are back in pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH adjust your cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you've had your nutrients,
after the clone X solution is in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: now we're going to pH this solution to 5.7
to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the next move is to add a product
called clear res.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear res is a product that will prevent
algae buildup and funk buildup inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: this cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it will help the bottoms of these
clones that we're going to be they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be exposed and hanging down into
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear res will stop them and prevent them
from getting mushy and moldy and funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help prevent that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll prevent bacteria and algae growth
inside your cloner on the outer edge of
[SPEAKER_01]: your cloner where the water splashes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll also prevent those plants from
getting mushy and stale and rotted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put clear res inside of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote 30 mils per five gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these clone machines hold five,
10, 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've kind of designed it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every five gallons of water,
you want to apply 30 milliliters of clear
[SPEAKER_01]: res to your cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's something important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Date this right down the date,
whatever the date is right down today's
[SPEAKER_01]: date, and then put that you put clear res
in there and then put how much just to
[SPEAKER_01]: remind yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you come back, you know how much
goes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we're going to do this is
because we need to reapply the clear res
[SPEAKER_01]: every five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means every five days,
we're going to check on this cloner every
[SPEAKER_01]: day, but every fifth day, we need to pop
it open and put more clear res in there
[SPEAKER_01]: because this product does need to be
reapplied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now at this point, we've got our clear
res in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have got our pH solution in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got an EC of 1.0 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a pH of 5.7 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also added our clear res at 30
milliliters per five gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's what we're going to put in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the machine is now ready to put the
top on with the neoprens in there and plug
[SPEAKER_01]: it in and let that bad dog start running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it run for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it circulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let everything get cycled around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to check the EC and the pH
one more time if you've got OCD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to adjust this and correct it
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have another opportunity to check
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's running around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's making that noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whooshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what we're going to do is pop out a
few random neoprens, especially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take out a few of those clone collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take my dry finger and put it down in
that hole where the clone is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got kind of long fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it down at least one or two knuckles
and then take your finger out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing an oil check basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those sprayers wetting your finger at
all locations within that cloner,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the corners?
[SPEAKER_01]: The corners always seem to get fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you're getting spray to the
corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do an oil check basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop out a neoprene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your finger in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry your finger off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try another one and just make sure that
all sections are getting sprayed properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want all of these clones to get sprayed
so we have a hundred percent success rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When one clone starts dying in there,
it gets mushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets funky and it starts to fuck up the
entire process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want them all to be healthy inside
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got it spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read my notes and catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the SOP that you'll find on
Discord, it does say to lift up the lid of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually says, let me find the note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open up the cloner with the pump on to
make sure it's spraying water everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting good coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That word spraying everywhere is the key
word in that sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's spraying everywhere inside
of that cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also when you do this, it is going to
spray everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to get your shirt wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't wear your favorite shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't wear your favorite Jordans or your
favorite dunks when you do this because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get water everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this happens for a brief moment,
water is going to spray out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can add more tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some solution in there that
you'll have to replace, but not a big
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lift it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to peek in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it spray in your eyes and be a
goofball.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to skip this step,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does say to do so in the SOP
because it's a good idea just to lift it
[SPEAKER_01]: up and make it spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get water everywhere when
you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, this SOP was written for a
commercial environment where if we get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little water in the floor, we'll just mop
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a carpeted area, if you're in
your own home-grow space where you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get it wet, skip this step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should make that disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This SOP works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This SOP works in commercial environments
across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: This works in home-grows across the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, some people modify this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything is perfect for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not have the space, the room,
the environment, the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're limited by physical
capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're limited by electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're limited by electrical
capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you could do to the best of your
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modify and adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a good grower would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rambling today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to whatever did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what made me ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I know what I smoked and I don't
even remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're checking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making sure that it's spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done the oil check.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've stuck your finger in a few places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've lifted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, now it's time for the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is time to fill this EZ Cloner with
your favorite clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'm not sure if I put in the
notes here that I want to stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking clones from more than one
plant, if you've got OG Kush and Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Dream or Golden Goat and fucking Bubble
Goat in the room, I would recommend a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get on a nice ramble here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend, first of all,
take the one plant you're taking clones
[SPEAKER_01]: from now and bring it to the cloning area
and put the others over there out of reach
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you cannot fuck this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could accidentally take six clones of
Bubble Goat and not clone your Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a person that comes from a commercial
background where our genetics are very
[SPEAKER_01]: important and proper labeling of those
genetics is just as important,
[SPEAKER_01]: this part's very important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say grab the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got more than one, if you only got
one plant, disregard all this nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got two plants, grab the one you
want to clone and bring it close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the other one and push it far so you
can't accidentally take a cut off of that
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, right before you do this,
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use plant tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are little plastic plant tags that
are probably three, three and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: three and three quarter inches long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're slim.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a pointy end at one end and
square at the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plastic basic garden plant tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get those and before I even take the
cuts, I think how many I need,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need three of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will label three of them, Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will take my Golden Goat plant over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take my three Golden Goat cuts and
then, okay, now this is where we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get into the SOP a little bit,
but I want you to label these things very
[SPEAKER_01]: carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also between plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned this earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have enough scissors, swap
scissors, completely swap scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always wear gloves when you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should have been in the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear gloves while you're doing this,
but also if you can between plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: swap out gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to spread any plant borne
viruses on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moisture from the plants is where that
virus will be transferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the gloves like a condom and use
scissors like a toy and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use the same scissors,
swish them around in bleach, not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: blades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the whole fucking scissors in the
bleach while you're wearing a glove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that in there and then change your
glove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fresh gloves, fresh scissors or new
scissors for every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not spread plant viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're being sanitary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are sterilizing our scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're being extra careful to make
sure to label these plants correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also being careful to not cross
contaminate by cleaning our scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is when you get to take these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your healthy mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it said, bring it to your cloning
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like nice, healthy shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually on the top of the plant,
there's that one nice fat top growing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time I'm going to top that
plant anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that top growing because
that's going to grow right into my grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take that out, it actually makes
all the lowers of the plant fight for
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant says, hey, you took out the big
leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took out the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all have the opportunity to be the
head now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those buds start, all those branches
start growing up and trying to be the new
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take that main top out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back to the SOP here and we'll
catch all of this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take that main top out is what we're
going to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says fill the AeroCloner with five to
seven inch cuttings taken from the mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm taking that main top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a five to seven inch cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if you're watching on the video,
that's about how tall my fingers are
[SPEAKER_01]: showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to clean most of that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have your top two leaves
coming off the top here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have a little space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a little shoot with the leaf
coming off of that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pluck that leaf off, but leave the
shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else off of there will get
cleaned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I leave that shoot is because
that does contain hormones that will
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one extra shoot does.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where hormones will develop and are
stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else explain that more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You Okim guys explain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You botany majors explain that in the
comment section there, but that will help
[SPEAKER_01]: with your rooting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds wild does help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we're going to clean that clone
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I will give them what I
call the dirty haircut.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the leaves are long and big and huge
and going to protrude and rest on other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I pull them up and just give them
a little trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need all that leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need enough for that plant to live,
but I don't need all of that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a five to seven inch cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've cleaned up most of the bottom and
I've given it the dirty haircut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says now ensure that each cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are details we should fucking
hit here before that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ensure that each cut has a 45 degree
angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm cutting these, I cut them at a 45
degree angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next step is split the end of
each cut with a razor blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've managed to do this with good sharp
scissors or a razor blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're taking the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say that the cutting is this
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my cutting right here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My finger is now the cutting and I want to
split that stock right up the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just very short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I say how far I think it should be an
eighth of an inch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ensure that you split.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't even put how far split the
end of each cut with a razor blade,
[SPEAKER_01]: just about an eighth of an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to do is I want to split the
end of it just enough to where when that
[SPEAKER_01]: easy cloner starts spraying it,
it's going to kind of open that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to split it up and those two
ends will start to curl up and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: where the roots are going to form from
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cut it at a 45 and then I also cut it
right up the middle, just a real short
[SPEAKER_01]: snip up the middle, just to encourage that
to spread apart and then the roots will
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I am reading this SOP for the show,
I realize it is written in a I could have
[SPEAKER_01]: been written in a different order,
but I'm going to present it in the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: order and then I may go back and correct
it while I'm actually editing this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, so the first thing you want to do is
you want to get the cut, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the cut from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want to clean it up and leave
just that one little shoot and the top
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to give it the dirty
haircut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull up those leaves, trim that excess
leaf off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a pretty good looking cut at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make that 45 degree angle at the bottom,
slip it up the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you encourage it to do a little
bit of spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that makes sense here according to
the SOP, but I could have written that in
[SPEAKER_01]: a better order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this point, we are going to dip
this clone in our clone X gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the purple clone X clone gel
comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I like to do it, I never dip into
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always pour the purple solution into
another vessel, whether it's a paper
[SPEAKER_01]: plate, whether it's a glass plate from the
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I really like to do is I get a beer
cup, the same cup I use for my clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I will just cut it to where I cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even cut the bottom of it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut the sides of it off to where I just
have enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can lay onto the table and pour the
solution onto there and use it like the
[SPEAKER_01]: little palette that the artist uses for
his paint, because it's not going to run
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have it level, it will stay in
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will run if you angle it, but I just
make a little palette, put some clone X
[SPEAKER_01]: gel on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I take the end of the cutting and I
dip that one inch end of it, the new end
[SPEAKER_01]: we just cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dip about an inch of it into the clone X
gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just rubbing that onto that,
whatever it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that purple stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it over that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it's going to drip off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it drip off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it drip right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I take that clone color, the Pac-Man,
and I open it up and I put the clone right
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the Pac-Man clone collar
and then pop that right into the hole in
[SPEAKER_01]: the clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that little plant tag, that plastic
plant tag that we took earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: I put that right next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fits right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man bites that and sets it right
inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're taking the clones,
you will know exactly what I mean when I
[SPEAKER_01]: say Pac-Man bites the clone label.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clone is right in the middle of
Pac-Man and then right at the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the clone label is in
Pac-Man's mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and simple if you do it nice and
simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, fill up the clone machine,
get it set up with all your products,
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to the right EC and pH,
then clip them, dip them, and stick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, you can basically repeat
this process and fill the clone machine
[SPEAKER_01]: and set it and forget it until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is a good time to warn you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes these clones go into what I call
zombie mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do everything correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you're cutting them, by the time you
get to the end of the cloner, all those
[SPEAKER_01]: first cuts are going to be dead,
limp, falling over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to look like it's fucking
toast, but just chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you come back tomorrow, there's a
good chance, probably 90% chance,
[SPEAKER_01]: if the mother plant was healthy and if you
did this all correctly, those plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: rise from the dead and they will look
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good idea to let these cuts sit
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the cut is taken from the plant,
don't let it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it into water or get it into this
clone machine pretty quickly because we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to prevent an embolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make you paranoid and make
you stressed over it, but a lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: that is what is going to kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much oxygen gets into that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucks up the capillary action inside
that plant and it will simply kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get it into a cup of water and stop
the oxygen from getting in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get it into the clone machine and
get water spraying on there, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get into that machine as quickly as
possible, but if they do tip over,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they go into zombie mode, don't stress
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually within 24, maybe less hours,
they'll start perking back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I did not mention in this
SOP, this is not listed in here that I see
[SPEAKER_01]: that, my bad, I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: These just need to be under minimal
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want super intense lighting
because that is going to cook these little
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, less lighting is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will encourage the root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much lighting, too intense lighting
will make the plants want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no roots to support that growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a little T5 light, if you just got
a T5 light, that'd be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an LED light, turn it down
real low or keep it low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up real high, one of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be great for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: AC Infinity does offer a wonderful clone
lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely what I would recommend
because of course use coupon code IREARMY
[SPEAKER_01]: to save 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just a little bit of light is great
for clones and I recommend keeping it on
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, environment matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are using the clone machine,
you can keep these machines in your
[SPEAKER_01]: regular veg room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want the same VPD essentially as your
veg environment, as your small veg
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of humidity is good for these
plants, but we don't need to keep them as
[SPEAKER_01]: humid as we do the plants in the dome
because these plants aren't as reliant on
[SPEAKER_01]: the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting a lot of moisture from the
bottom, which will sustain them and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basic humidity that you're running
in your veg room should be fine for these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put too much wind on them,
but maybe a little bit of fan across the
[SPEAKER_01]: room just circulating the air would be a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did not mention lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not mention VPD and the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I do need to add that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can think about that as I'm editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I did say the plants are good for
until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said they may go into zombie mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go walk the dog and let these plants do
their thing for a little while and just
[SPEAKER_01]: ignore them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do make sure that everything is spraying
occasionally, but don't freak out too much
[SPEAKER_01]: if the plants have gone into zombie mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's what we got to do in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what the plants look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they've all tipped over and fucking
died, my bad, we got to try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're starting to perk up,
which they should by now, you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we need to do, unplug it so the water
quit spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lift up the top very carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to check the EC and the pH of
that solution once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been running for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that purple clone gel that we've
dipped the plants into basically got
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed and hosed off by the cloner and is
now all in our water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the EC and the pH of that water has
drastically changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time to adjust that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get it back to the proper range.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it in that 1.0 to 1.2 and that 5.7
to 6.2 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to adjust that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to do that today and then make a
note that you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you do this every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an app in my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says cloner and then I go in there
and I say today I did this and today I did
[SPEAKER_01]: this and now I need to add clear as and I
write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way if I come back later,
I go did I fucking do this like I know I
[SPEAKER_01]: did because it's right there on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if I did or didn't and I know what
I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how the clones look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make weird notes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make all the weird notes you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more details the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come back, adjust the EC, adjust the pH
and check on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how they look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look good?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they look good, you don't need to
adjust too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure everything is spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll know because if they've fallen over
it's probably or if they're not falling
[SPEAKER_01]: over that's probably spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so now after this we want to do our
daily check every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to adjust that pH and that EC
that drastic first time because that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: is dripped off but we're gonna want to
check every day just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of bubbles happening in
here that is going to change our pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water is going to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to change our EC and pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the daily check that I recommend for
this cloner, make sure the pumps are on
[SPEAKER_01]: and working.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're at a home grow, if you're at a
commercial grow, when you walk into that
[SPEAKER_01]: grow listen for that hum that where are
those pumps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that shit working?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing I hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I walk into a micro and I don't hear
that, it feels like something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the cloners are being cleaned or
not in service, it gives me an uneasy
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure the pumps are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure the water level is still just
below the halo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want too much water to evaporate
to run out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll burn out the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also stick your finger in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hot or cold is that water?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's extreme, we may need to do some
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's way too hot, ice is the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can freeze water bottles, fill up a
bunch of water bottles, put them in your
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer and rotate them out throughout the
day to try to keep that water cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too hot, if that water is too
cold, that's weird because I like it nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me jump back in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get interrupted by a visit from Nico
the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy, Nico the dog
cannot refuse a visit from a sweet dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came to say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will edit that nice and cleanly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about checking on the
cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure we're talking about the
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I talked about was putting
your finger in there, making sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: that water isn't too hot or too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too cold, it's going to freeze out
your clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too hot, they're going to get
moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer cold temperatures,
cold or water is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does prevent the mold, the mildew and
the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I think we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing says to remove a clone
collar and check the spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call this the oil check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop out one of the neoprene collars,
put your finger down in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure your finger gets wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to make sure everything is
getting sprayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is getting wet because if not,
then the clones will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is our daily check.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do that every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure the pumps are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure the water level are at the right
level and we're not fucking burning out
[SPEAKER_01]: the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the water is not too hot or
too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to do, just check and see if
your water is spraying out of the holes
[SPEAKER_01]: where the tubing should go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll leave you little ports for your
power cord and if you wanted to put a
[SPEAKER_01]: heater or an air pump or something in
there, they'll leave you little ports,
[SPEAKER_01]: little tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're not leaking through
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do, this is a little pro tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge pro tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take one of those plant tags,
the plant tags we talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: I fold it in half and it breaks and then I
stick those in front of the little tunnels
[SPEAKER_01]: so that none of the water can spray out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're making sure that none of the
water is spraying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just make sure there's no algae,
no mild, no funkiness happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is, we might want to replace that
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might want to give it a little bit of
scrub.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take the top right off that
clone machine and set it down and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: can clean out that bottom part,
refresh the water if you need to,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it right back on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every day we're going to go in,
make sure the pumps are on, make sure the
[SPEAKER_01]: water level is appropriate, make sure the
heat is right, make sure no funk is
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, and then you're going to give it
a little oil check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your finger in there and see if your
finger gets wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then every fifth day, every fifth day,
you could do this on the fifth day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every fifth day, you can count that
however you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to say on day five or
does this count on the fifth day?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're doing it about every
fifth day on your fifth day schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: that's consistent, it will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every fifth day, we're also going to do
the everyday check, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ignore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to add the clear res
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the size of your cloner,
you're going to add more of that solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, so I'm using a large,
easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down 150 mils depending on the
size of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the appropriate amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 30 milliliters per five gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should edit this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But update the amount of clear res.
[SPEAKER_01]: Date the cloner once again so that we know
when you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said to write down the date when you put
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write it down Monday, the first and I
stick that sticker on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I refresh it, I write the
new date on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to put a sticker on your
cloner, do it in your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write down the date that you put that
clear res in there so that you know to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it every fifth day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the water level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the other checks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's not too hot, not too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure there's no mildew grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then recheck the EC and the pH of this
clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend doing that almost every
day if you've got time, but we definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do it on day five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that that EC and pH are proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be the EC once again 1.0 to
1.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pH, we want that at 5.8 to 6.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is basically what we've got
to repeat through about a 14, maybe a 15
[SPEAKER_01]: day process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your environment is not right,
if your mother plants are not super
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, maybe a 20 day process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within, I want to say 12 to 14 days,
you should have plants with nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, robust roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post a picture of a plant on my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast
Instagram page and check out that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That came from an easy cloner in just two
weeks with crazy roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be blown away by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is basically what we've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I make clones for a commercial
environment with about 99% success rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the 1% failure is because
something clogs up or something just went
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong and I can't be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 99% success rate with this SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I've sold this SOP to other
commercial environments or other
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial processors for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time to stop selling and
gatekeeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give it to you for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how to clone with an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that basically does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to hit pause real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink and then we'll
come back and we'll talk about how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this in a clone dome environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am back and I am hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go too far, let me teach you how
to clean this clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say you got all the way through
the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have potted the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that is in the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potting the clones is in the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's just say you made it this far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need to talk about cleaning this
clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: After everything is transplanted,
the clone machine is empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply some bleach to the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SOP says three cups of bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is for a large clone machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduce that if you're using your personal
cloner at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put three cups in a fucking 30 site
cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe put a half a cup or a cup of bleach
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it run.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to run that bleach through
all your pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to spray the bottoms of the
neoprenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to bleach everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow we need to dump out all that
water in that bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we need to fill it up and rinse it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it run for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let all that stuff cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dump it out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I like to let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I take apart the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I unscrew everything as far as I can and
clean everything by hand with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: brush and with some tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that pump apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes that pump will get full of
algae and funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's clean that out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the emitters, those red emitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend buying another bag of them
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go to Amazon and order another bag of
those emitters for your clone machine
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if the mic just fucked up or
the headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks good on the recording or good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get more of those emitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have more, clean those out
with a paper clip or a toothpick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go up and clean them from the
bottom and then from the side and clean
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks trying to put them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks trying to take them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they break, the way that I pull them
out is I take a pair of scissors and I
[SPEAKER_01]: open up the scissor and I use one piece of
the scissor and I go right into the hole
[SPEAKER_01]: deep enough to kind of just stab it and
then turn the scissor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be enough to unscrew it for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little pro tip right there because
you're going to fucking break one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy more right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill it up with bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dump it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill it up with clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it run again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dump it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I take the bitch apart and clean
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let it dry all the way dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there's no bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no residuals left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paper clip the emitters out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you're using and I'm not sponsored
by this company, but it's the only company
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend reusing the clone
collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are called permaclone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their collars are made out of a different
substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Age fucking modern advanced
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw those in the microwave and
sterilize those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other brand are made of a porous
surface that I would not recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: reusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using permaclone,
clean those, sterilize them, reuse them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other brand throw them the fuck away,
buy new ones, replace those, use all new
[SPEAKER_01]: clone collars and try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should talk about the transplanting,
but this is the clone episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the potting episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next part of the episode is to talk
about clone care for using a rapid router
[SPEAKER_01]: and dome environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we jump into the second half of the
podcast, I do need to let you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: the second half of the podcast is worth
double points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about cloning in a rapid router
and dome environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying rapid router and dome
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: The alternative to using the clone machine
method is to get a tray and that tray has
[SPEAKER_01]: an insert with usually 50 little squares,
little spots in that tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then sometimes it comes with your clone
plugs or you buy a bag of clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several different brands here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said rapid routers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Root Riots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several other different brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a pressed product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even think of what the pressed
shit is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pressing something together to
make a consistency of a product that is
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect for a clone to grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same size and shape as the tray
insert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it fits right in that little hole in
your tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a hole in the top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically put your clone in that
little tiny hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what I mean by a rapid router.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I mean by a root riot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very little difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest difference honestly is price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them charge a lot more than the
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them come with nutrients inside of
them already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't matter to me because I rinse
that out and put my own nutrients in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This does sort of apply to Rockwell cubes,
except the method is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell is more finicky and more picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is easier in my opinion with riot
router or root riot and rapid router brand
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's others that are very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow along, adjust and adapt as
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also this goes in a tray with the
insert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you put the plugs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the clones in and then it goes
with the dome over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dome is the pain in the ass part
of this process in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have success with this method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just prefer the other method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be a long fucking episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double points for the second half of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to make clones in a clone dome rapid
router environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I do, I get a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I'm doing 50 clones at a time
because the tray holds 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easier to do all 50 because that
helps regulate the humidity in the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do all 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the amount you're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do, I soak the rapid routers in
a week, but pH balanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solution before plugging them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of words, but I take a
container, usually a three or five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket, fill it up with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mix a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that solution next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I drop my rapid routers right into
that bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I take my hand and just mush them
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to, if there's already
nutrients in there, I want to kind of wash
[SPEAKER_01]: it out and replace it with my new nutrient
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this SOP that's written here,
it says use three milliliters of a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: product, nine of another five of another
two of another, and then pH it at six
[SPEAKER_01]: point one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, or three grams of veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got other stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be just as easy to use
the yellow clone X solution for this
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be on this SOP as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe while I'm editing the podcast,
I will update and edit the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that yellow clone X solution would
work just right for this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This does need to be updated a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've said that a couple of times,
but so I'm soaking my rapid routers in a
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, just a light solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to put all those rapid
routers in the tray into those little,
[SPEAKER_01]: the trays got 50 little spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This should make sense to you with the
whole side pointing up because I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: put my clone in that hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to take clones if I see pest
problems, but in this part of the SOP,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did include that if there are pest
problems, you could apply this to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the easy cloner part as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there are problems, I will do a
dunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will dunk my cuttings in a pesticide
solution before putting them into my
[SPEAKER_01]: machine or into my dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this SOP, let me see if I did include
my pesticide mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: If pest problems are apparent in the
mother area, dunk cuttings before taking
[SPEAKER_01]: them in a weak oil based mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use 25 milliliters of Smite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smite was a product I was using when I
wrote this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smite is still a good product that would
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 10 milliliters of Evergreen,
which is what I would probably recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing this dunk, make sure
that this product is super stirred up very
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emulsified is the word I think I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep stirring it continuously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a stir stick and stir this container
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to get thick in one spot
or light in one spot of your solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take our cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a little dunk if we see
any pest problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we do the dunk into the pesticide,
we're going to do a dunk into clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to wash off the excess pesticide by
putting it into clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first dunk is going to get rid of your
bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they come off when you're
dunking it and rinsing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is to wash off that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says here after you dunk them,
please redunk them into the plain water
[SPEAKER_01]: and shake them until almost dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important not to leave much oil on
the plants while they are rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, it will suffocate the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second off, it can cause a reaction with
the grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: This product could become toxic to the
plant because of the grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is when we're going to cut the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked earlier about cutting cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says here, cut your clones from the
healthiest growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a five to eight inch cut off of a
mother plant at a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that 45 earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always use scissors cleaned with rubbing
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to upgrade that to bleach
because we've got hoplite and viroid in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have it here, but it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to clean things with bleach
just to step this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trim away the bottom nodes, leaving two to
three at the top to let the clone
[SPEAKER_01]: establish itself the same way we did
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup the leaves in your hand and give them
that dirty haircut like I talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's an addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of splitting it up the middle,
we're going to do a little scrape on this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grab the plant and just kind
of scrape it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take off the outside layer of
skin, just skin off the little piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: celery skin off the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: of this plant in one or two or three
spots, and that will encourage root growth
[SPEAKER_01]: from that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So scrape the edges of the 45 degree with
a razor to expose more tissue to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then place the end of the clone into the
rooting compound, just like we did in the
[SPEAKER_01]: previous part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my rooting gel on a vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going to rub that, rub that clone
right into that gel, do about the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: inch of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let me make sure we're following
the notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Place the cut, place the end of the cut
into the rooting hormone compound for a
[SPEAKER_01]: moment, then stick the clone into the
rapid rooter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clip it, dip it and stick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that easy, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end should slightly penetrate the P
plug to be secure, but not that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's made of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pete, thank you for having notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poke it through to be secure, but not all
the way through the bottom of the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that plug is an inch deep,
go three quarters of an inch deep into
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't poke it out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it comes out of the bottom,
you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it three quarters of the way in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it in far enough to keep the
clone from toppling over, but not all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So place the clone into the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end should, the bottom should not pop
out of the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here's where we're going to do things
a little differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get the dome, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a dome for this setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to spray the inside of the
dome with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to put that dome over
these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the vents on this dome are closed
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any open venting at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have put solution in our clone
plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the clone plugs in the tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have clipped our clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've cleaned them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken off some of the bottoms,
given them the dirty haircut, cut it at a
[SPEAKER_01]: 45, give it a couple of scrapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've dipped it into our purple clone
X gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now popped it into the cloner,
not too deep, but deep enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: just how they like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've taken the lid, the dome,
and we have sprayed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to place that on top of
the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And close all of the vents in the
openings.
[SPEAKER_01]: These clones are sealed inside of this
dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use those fancy paper clips from
Office Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the kind you would bundle thick
amounts of paper together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use those to hold that dome in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no chance of it coming off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to put that dome under a
little bit of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like once again, those T5 lights or a
light fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If all you have is a big light,
put it off in the periphery on the floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of far away from that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend this light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be on for 24 hours and no dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back to the notes and make sure
I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray the inside of the dome with water
and put the clones under a lamp for four
[SPEAKER_01]: to five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to touch this for four to
five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until the plugs are barely getting
dry to re-moisten.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the plugs change from dark
black to lighter brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soak the tray for a few minutes with your
nutrient solution until the plugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: black again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always drain off all the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a container, a cup,
if you will, and get your nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to use the same nutrient solution
we used last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easy cloner solution at 1.0 will be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix some of that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it into a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pour that over these clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just drip it all over each one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to fill that bottom tray with
a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be heavy and have excess
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lift out the tray of plants and take that
bottom tray and dump that extra water out
[SPEAKER_01]: of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then set that tray of plugs right back in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to get, we want it wet and we
want it saturated, but we don't want them
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want them sitting in soggy water
to where it gets moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do want it to start evaporating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do want to create a little bit of a dry
back over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to get it saturated,
but not sitting in water at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another way to do this when they're
brand new, I would take a spray bottle and
[SPEAKER_01]: mix up the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in a spray bottle and spray the
clone plugs because it's much more gentle
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have much more control of how much
water is applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when I do that, I would not
moisten enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not get to the bottom of the
plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you're watering thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moisten those plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you do it, make sure they're
nicely moistened around day four or day
[SPEAKER_01]: five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me make sure we're getting back to the
notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, place the cuts, place securely,
poke through the bottom four or five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait till the plugs are barely getting dry
to re-moisten.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them change colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boys and girls, you can pick them up and
feel the weight, feel the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they feel wet and cold, then they are
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're starting to get dry and
brittle, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need water all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already, if it's way too soggy,
you can gently squeeze some of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful not to destroy any of the roots
that have started to develop monkey hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in there and gently squeeze the water
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not a gentle dude like my friend
Soda, don't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of you folks can squeeze the
water right out of there if there's too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get those plugs re-saturated,
put the dome back on there and put them
[SPEAKER_01]: back under the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the SOP says after seven days,
open the vents on the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe your dome's got a vent on the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's got some side vents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's open those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe don't go all the way right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe for a minute, open it a quarter of
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back an hour later, open it another
quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back an hour later, do it a little
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not shock them.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best things we can do with
these clones is everything we do from now
[SPEAKER_01]: on, do it gradually and incrementally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's the word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe might be the word here because we're
going to increase over time each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after seven days, open the vents on the
dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all at once, not extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go slow with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then beginning at day 12, if you're in a
rush and you've got experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can start this at day 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beginning at day 12, we're going to
start hardening the clones off by removing
[SPEAKER_01]: the dome for short periods of time and
increasing that period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the first day, when you go into the
grow, just take that dome off and set a
[SPEAKER_01]: timer for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set the timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe set it for 15 minutes and go check
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they look like shit after 15 minutes,
put the dome back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is adjustable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But set a timer, 15, 30 minutes for the
first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 30 minutes, maybe 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the dome back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then tomorrow, we're going to do the same
thing, 15 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next day, we're going to increase
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been doing 15, we're going to do
30.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been doing 30, we're going to do
60.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do 60 for two to three
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to do 90 minutes for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to do a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by now, these plants are getting used
to being in the environment where you
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't have to recover them.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you can get them open for five or
six hours without any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can leave that dome off for five,
six, maybe even eight hours and not see
[SPEAKER_01]: any trouble, those plants are successfully
rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to pick them up out of the
tray and look at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have roots growing out of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be visible roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time now to pop these clones into
the mix of your choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check my notes here and make sure
we've got, yeah, it says here,
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever clones have rooted plant into our
cocoa mix, which I'm going to edit that as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, the clones are ready
for planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I've gotten you all the way
through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same process for both things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set up your medium or your product,
whatever they're going to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prepare that first.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC and pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a light prepared before you even do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then clip them, dip them, and stick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appropriately for your method.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing the clones and the easy
cloner, clip them, dip them, stick them,
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance your machine every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other day, every five days,
you will be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing the clone dome,
clip them, dip them, stick them,
[SPEAKER_01]: go on vacation for three or four days and
come back and then start fucking with them
[SPEAKER_01]: and slowly acclimate them to your
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they got the roots, it'll be obvious
either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lift up that clone machine and
look in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see roots, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll go roots man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see the roots, it is time to
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: To pot them into our mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that will be my next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll do some updates to this episode
and I will record the episode about
[SPEAKER_01]: potting our clones into their first pair
of shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, seed poppers, clone cutters,
everybody out there in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.

[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what I messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what I got right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how you feel.

organic chemistry guy, if you know more
[SPEAKER_01]: about plants and botany than me,
leave some comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate me and correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the interaction and the comment
section.
