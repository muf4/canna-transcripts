[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of honeysuckle live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of lemon essence and Han
Solo burger on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as honey,
sweet lemons and floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab of it before I read the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I described the flavor as sweet and
tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it was almost like somebody took a
lay from Hawaii and put it in the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the flavor delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the buzz to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like the honeysuckle live
batter on the back of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it contains 67.22% THC and non
detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the honeysuckle live
batter.

[SPEAKER_00]: to make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the next part on the list is I
owe a big thank you to a few other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the previous episode, I read a message
from a disabled veteran who was asking
[SPEAKER_00]: about advice for a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think that their budget was going
to get them a quality light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked my audience for a little bit of
guidance and possibly some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response was overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener that asked for help is going
to get a grow light and a few more of my
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners are going to get grow lights,
because we had some very generous people
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
I will be in the works of putting people
[SPEAKER_00]: in touch to get grow lights shipped to the
appropriate people so we can get some
[SPEAKER_00]: disabled veterans and some people in need
growing quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the people that helped me
and contributed wanted a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not why they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it because they're kind people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like a shout out on my show,
send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will highlight you I will say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends who are going to get grow
lights, they appreciate the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a great heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really overwhelming to see what my
little show here could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Hey, ladies and gentlemen,
there's a disabled veteran in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have some advice or possibly a grow
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just reached out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, here's advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's grow lights, just take them and
put them where you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also means a lot to the people who
are getting the grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of messages I'd really
like to get to on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: With no further ado, the first message on
today's episode goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up rasta Jeff, my name is I'm going
to skip the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I go by grizzly grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my name if you would like to
what up Kent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Kent, the grizzly
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just wanted to let you know I
am super stoked to be a contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: member of the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a weed nerd and I followed sub
cool for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with his passing, I was left lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am always going to going to consider
myself a weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we're in the same club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were both big followers and supporters
of sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are both in the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be the leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I may have designated lemur priest
as the leader of the iry army,
[SPEAKER_00]: the captain and commander, but we are iry
army together gang gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: When sub cool passed, I did feel sort of
an absence a gap in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna keep reading the message before
I get rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, with sub cools passing,
I felt lost but I found you and I'm so
[SPEAKER_00]: glad I did bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad you found me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm so appreciative of your
knowledge of your willingness to teach and
[SPEAKER_00]: spread love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really dig your style and your
techniques and your breeding style is on
[SPEAKER_00]: point bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message does go on there's more but I
think more of it is for me to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more private to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part I wanted to touch on is the sub
cool part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you first of all for the
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When sub cool passed, I did feel a void
there was an opening there was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that had to be done sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love him or hate him sub cool was a great
teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was outspoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked to interact with his people,
his followers, whatever you call them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the TGA team green Avengers, he interacted
the weed nerds he interacted with the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: nerds quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed that I learned a lot from him
without sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be where I am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you love sub if you hate sub,
I am partly his fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's partly my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I'm his fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: He created this monster is part of what
created this monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without subby, I wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have a podcast things would be
much different for both of us without sub
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I'm getting at is when sub
cool passed, I knew there was a void I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew there was a gap that needed to be
filled and I think I slowly accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: took it upon myself to kind of fill that
sub cool gap somebody's got to be teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: people somebody's got to be reading emails
and giving solutions and helping shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that would be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've stepped up my game a little bit
since sub cool is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do more shows I try to do more live
shows I go on more things I answer more
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try I've tried to step up and fill the
space that sub cool left I feel like in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way the torch has been passed I was the
generation after sub cool sub cool didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: physically reach down and go rasta Jeff
it's your turn but in many ways that torch
[SPEAKER_00]: was passed to me I know that it's my
responsibility to carry on that sub cool
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that he was doing in several ways
I'm doing it here on social media here on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube here on Apple podcasts through
podcasting through social media I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the sub cool vibe and things
carrying on through me I'm doing my own
[SPEAKER_00]: thing but a lot of it is for and from sub
another thing I'm doing have done is I
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed a bunch of my stuff to a sub cool
jack the ripper male I've got a jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: ripper male that is just a fucking stud
I've pollinated several of my irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics elite cuts with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've crossed the irie genetics with the
sub cool seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I can do to kind of honor
sub cool I made jack the ripper f twos
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll keep sub cools memory and honor
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be growing in people's gardens long
after we're both gone so that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be something I could do for sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man I got just rambly a lot here also I
owe a shout out to somebody recently I
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired a Chernobyl clone a plant it's
not even a clone it's a fucking small
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and it is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you contributed that Chernobyl to the
garden thank you that will be put to great
[SPEAKER_00]: use it will be bred to there's already a
strain name in mind I already know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to create with that you guys are
going to love it but thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning sub cool sub cool has been
coming up a lot lately it was recently sub
[SPEAKER_00]: cools birthday his passing has been on my
mind for some reason lately it was great
[SPEAKER_00]: to read this message about sub cool thank
you thank you for the compliments and
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for you didn't compare me to sub
you but you kind of put me right up there
[SPEAKER_00]: with sub who was one of my many heroes so
thank you long live sub cool rest in peace
[SPEAKER_00]: sub cool I'm doing what I can with the
torch I've been passed thanks for letting
[SPEAKER_00]: me ramble about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend Kent the
grizzly grower 13 all right I'm gonna keep

[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like she may be over the cancer
now I hope that is going well keep
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting mama stay strong let's all send
some good vibes out to kojax mama here bro
[SPEAKER_00]: take a fat dab and really give your mama
hug for me it goes on though it says she
[SPEAKER_00]: loves CBD and tinctures but they are
insanely expensive in California yes CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality CBD is expensive right now
don't get that gas station shit don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: that china stuff get quality CBD products
that you can rely on it says $50 for 15
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters is not uncommon I want to try
my hand at growing some CBD hybrids do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any experience with CBD strains if so
are there any differences between normal
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC plants when it comes to feeding
watering training to really bring out more
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD any additional information would be
greatly appreciated then there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: note that's left here for myself I'm gonna
make sure not to read that this is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: question kojax thank you and I will be in
touch about the the private message part
[SPEAKER_00]: so the main question here is our friend is
grow attempting wants to grow CBD rich
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to help mama with her numbness in
her hands and feet shout out to mom once
[SPEAKER_00]: again also shout out to you for being a
really good son and trying to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: your mama that's commendable so the main
question is are there any differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing CBD rich plants compared to
growing THC rich plants it's a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: question in my experience I did not notice
much difference if any difference at all
[SPEAKER_00]: when growing CBD dominant rich plants I
was working in a large commercial grow we
[SPEAKER_00]: had nearly a thousand plants in the
flowering room most of those plants we
[SPEAKER_00]: were aiming for that high THC stuff a lot
of golden goat we had lemon Jeffrey what
[SPEAKER_00]: was else what else was in there the the
pineapple the cactus cooler was in there
[SPEAKER_00]: just a bunch of stuff like that they would
really hit the pineapple something was in
[SPEAKER_00]: there a bunch of sativa stuff they would
really pay the lemon G was in there all
[SPEAKER_00]: day stuff they would pay the bills sativa
dominant stuff that hit real hard also we
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that we needed medicine in there for
the CBD desired people so we had some CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses in there if I remember correctly
in that grow we had harlequin in there
[SPEAKER_00]: also we had AC DC in there we also had a
plant called Tora Bora in there I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit about each of these plants
now harlequin was a CBD rich plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: grew like a sativa it grew tall it grew
skinny it had kind of longer slender
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves it didn't have the big fat white
leaves you would expect an indica plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: have it had more of a skinny sativa
structure that plant was very very CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: rich that one grew exactly like all of the
other THC plants in the garden it got tall
[SPEAKER_00]: it got branchy it looked just like them it
smelled just like them but when we cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down and tested it it was mostly I don't
remember the numbers off the top of my
[SPEAKER_00]: head but I know that that one was around
for the CBD and it was very CBD rich I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't doing anything in the grow special
to bring out the CBD it was just happening
[SPEAKER_00]: from that plant it was that plant's trait
so the harlequin grew tall and skinny it
[SPEAKER_00]: looked a lot like the other THC dominant
sativa style plants in the room the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one we were growing is AC DC the AC DC was
similar to the harlequin it was a tall
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it was branchy it had those skinnier
leaves it branched out quite a bit it had
[SPEAKER_00]: like more of a sativa look I just keep
saying sativa it had that branchier sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: look not the short squatty indica thing
that we think of sometimes when we may
[SPEAKER_00]: think of CBD plants so these two looked
like our normal THC plants they grew just
[SPEAKER_00]: like them they got the longer skinnier
leaves it didn't do anything different it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't smell look taste or grow any
differently than the rest of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those were rich rich in CBD we didn't do
anything I didn't do anything to either
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those plants to make them different
there was however a plant that I did grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that was known to be rich in CBD that was
a honestly it was a picky finicky little
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch that plant didn't like anybody or
anything everybody I gave that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: was like yeah I got rid of it fuck that
plant that plant was called Tora Bora that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was a gift from a friend they won
CBD awards with this plant this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: produced really great CBD numbers it was
like a 2.5 to 1 CBD to THC that meant for
[SPEAKER_00]: every THC nanogram or milliliter in the
percentage that was there there were 2.5
[SPEAKER_00]: percent 2.5 times that of CBD so if
there's one THC there was 2.5 whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: your measurement in increments was of CBD
that was kind of unheard of and amazing at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time that plant went around the
medical marijuana community here in
[SPEAKER_00]: southern Colorado for quite a while I got
it I'm not sure I was supposed to spread
[SPEAKER_00]: it out but since it's medicine like that I
fucking spread it out I gave that cut to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people also I bred to it none of
the breeding projects that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that were worth the shit either all the
offspring were a little bit funky they
[SPEAKER_00]: were finicky they were picky I was not the
best breeding ever so let's talk briefly
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Tora Bora it looked like a
purple squatty indica plant no matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: you did to it it would look angry and
frustrated the leaves would curl up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: tips it would turn purple and dark by the
end of flower it was an OG Kush dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I can't remember the cross off the
top of my head it was OG 18 and something
[SPEAKER_00]: else maybe LA confidential but they called
it Tora Bora it was from DNA genetics I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not bashing their strain I'm bashing the
cut that we had it put out amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine but it was a bitch to grow it was
the worst to grow in the garden it was
[SPEAKER_00]: squatty it was short it was stout it
didn't like water it didn't like being dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't like warm it liked being cold
and fucking just leave it alone and let it
[SPEAKER_00]: grow if you topped it it would slow down
if you popped and twisted it would get
[SPEAKER_00]: angry on you that plant sucked to grow so
the things I can say is in my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: there wasn't anything we but that plant
that Tora Bora plant that sucked put out
[SPEAKER_00]: high numbers no matter what we did so it
was I think it's plant specific if you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the plant like you're growing the THC
plants it should put out the high CBD if
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what the plant does I haven't
tried to bring out the CBD honestly I grow
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're running a 300 fucking light
area and you've got thousands of plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there they all get fed the same thing they
all get treated basically the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: there may be rows that treat it a certain
way but I don't we didn't do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: special to bring out the CBD and the CBD
rich plants I can talk about things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know they do on commercial CBD farms hemp
farms they do bring out the CBD but also
[SPEAKER_00]: this is done in Colorado this is my setup
to this in Colorado we have to test our
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD our hemp crops have to be tested for
THC and CBD if there is the higher amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC than allowed in there that crop
cannot be sold as hemp that is now a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis crop and if you're a hemp grower
that's now a legal it's got to be thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: away it's trash so one thing that the hemp
growers do to prevent their test from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too high in THC oftentimes they
will cut the plants down early you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have I don't I'm not going to assume
you've got the ability to test your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: on like a daily basis but in some cases
these guys on the farms with big CBD farms
[SPEAKER_00]: will cut a bud off of the branch off the
plant every three every five days every
[SPEAKER_00]: week at a certain starting around week six
they'll start cut maybe week five start
[SPEAKER_00]: taking buds off and mailing it into the
lab or getting it to the lab so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: test it the minute we see the THC starting
to rise higher than acceptable if we start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing THC in there we got to cut down the
plants because now they're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids are going to start
converting the CBG will now become THC
[SPEAKER_00]: that is their way around a lot of failing
lab tests just cut it early before it can
[SPEAKER_00]: become THC before it can convert also that
may be a thing you can do if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: higher CBD unless THC you may cut it down
earlier I'm not saying that's a way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it but that is something I've seen done in
Colorado if you want to get it before it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to THC you can do that if you're
making topicals or something and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: smokable that may be a viable option for
you another thing I do think helps is
[SPEAKER_00]: colder temperatures seems to bring out
that CBD I can't promise that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I've heard the CBD growers
mention so grow it just like normal dial
[SPEAKER_00]: it in I always say grow that cultivar grow
that plant a few times if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you know presents CBD grow
it the best you can and see how much CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: you were getting out of it one thing I can
recommend is cut it down at different
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals maybe cut one a week seven one
at week eight one a week nine maybe cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch a week seven eight nine and see
which one is better for you but to the
[SPEAKER_00]: best of my memory the best of my knowledge
the best of my ability we just grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD rich plants exactly like we do the THC
and we just let them produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids they naturally create for us
dial in the room dial in the plants build
[SPEAKER_00]: a relationship with it and hopefully you
can get those numbers up right where you
[SPEAKER_00]: need them good luck to mom I hope she is
cancer free I hope she's feeling better I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope you're able to help her out give her
a hug for us and thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: message Kojaks and of course thank you for
the patreon contribution I'm gonna hit
[SPEAKER_00]: this bottle of water here and we're gonna
keep moving you guys take a hit off a bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: or a rip off a bong well I take a rip off
this bottle bottle of water or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrate yourself as well here we go yeah
keep that voice fresh right all right I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not even gonna edit that part out of the
show thank you for joining me I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: another message this one comes from the
email box it comes from Mo roots big roots
[SPEAKER_00]: big respect thank you for the message it
says hey Rasta Jeff I have another
[SPEAKER_00]: question for you the question is to flush
or not to flush that is a great very
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial question it says the guys on
the dude grog show dude grows show have
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about whether it's beneficial or
not is this something new flushing has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a hot topic for quite a while I've
talked about it a couple of times it
[SPEAKER_00]: always comes up in the cannabis community
it's a great question it says have you
[SPEAKER_00]: tried this before is there new information
about flushing thanks again for your help
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a great day you can say my name
it is Ryan what's up Ryan thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: the great message so let's get into this
we're gonna stir up controversy on this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode I look forward to your feedback my
email address is grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com make sure you put the word
flush in the subject line when you respond
[SPEAKER_00]: about this flushing there are a lot of
ways to look at flushing a lot of ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: behind flushing a lot of purposes to
flushing and I see two different or three
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe four different approaches to
flushing if you're growing in a super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have taken a natural organic
product a bunch of I don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's gonna go in our super so alfalfa
meal we would hear bone meal fish meal
[SPEAKER_00]: blood meal I wouldn't put that stuff but
that type of stuff goes in if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: an organic living soil if you're building
a soil and it is cooking and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: using chelated bottled buffered nutrients
there may not be a need for flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: because your plant is not going to uptake
things that it doesn't need we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: force feeding the plant when you make an
organic soil that is just naturally bio
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the plant the roots go down
and this is just the very simple version
[SPEAKER_00]: of this don't get on me too critically the
roots start growing and they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and they say the plant goes hey roots we
need some nitrogen and the plants go oh
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nitrogen over here and it just
grows down it gets it and it eats up
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and then exudates in the plant
communicate with enzymes that communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: with the rhizosphere that says hey bro we
got enough nitrogen you think you can send
[SPEAKER_00]: up some molybdenum and the roots go
molybdenum we got you bro turn off the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen suckers start shooting molybdenum
around now it's like basically you had
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of your main course whatever your
main course was maybe now could you send
[SPEAKER_00]: me some mashed potatoes down sure bro we
got mashed potatoes for you so now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting different things the plant
signals that it needs different things
[SPEAKER_00]: through exudates to the root zone the root
zone goes oh you need this we'll go find
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it goes and finds those things the
plant basically eats what it needs when it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs it it's there bio available in your
plant in the rhizosphere in the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've whipped up and cooked an
organic soil or a living soil that has got
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your necessities in that soil right
so the plant it's not going to overfeed
[SPEAKER_00]: itself it's not going to stuff itself it's
not a fat glut and it's not going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: big old pork pot a big old pot belly jeez
that was hard to say it's not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a big old pot belly and just sit around
and become lazy because it's got to work
[SPEAKER_00]: for its food it's got triggers that tell
it i'm full i should stop eating the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference when we're feeding bottled
chelated nutrients is that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: things in those nutrients that tell the
plant fucking eat this and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just injecting the plant with
more nutrients all day long the signals to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell it to stop don't work because it's
not eating the right the same kind of food
[SPEAKER_00]: i just said right food maybe that organic
way is the way to go it's not eating the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that would tell that plant yeah
i've had enough nitrogen let's work on
[SPEAKER_00]: that molybdenum there are things in those
chelated buffer nutrients that go oh
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen take more oh nitrogen take more
and it's almost like drugs for your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will easily easily overdo it so
with those two things in mind with the
[SPEAKER_00]: salts and the bottled chelated nutrients
let's talk about why to flush one and why
[SPEAKER_00]: one may not be necessary i'm sure you
could see it with the bottled chelated
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients we've got a soil that is filled
with salts bottled nutrients chelations
[SPEAKER_00]: weird ionic exchanges that i'm not even
sure what's happening in there that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: being force-fed shit all day long so that
plant may need to be flushed because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot of excess stuff running through
that plant through its vascular system
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got things moving around mobile
elements that we may not that may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about this part in a
moment that may not be desirable when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to smoking time it may not make our
plants burn and taste the best that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could so in my opinion it is absolutely
desirable and best to flush if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using bottled nutrients absolutely flush
for seven ten maybe 14 days depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how much you fed what you fed and what
your uh what's in your pot are using cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: are using soilless mix if you're in hydro
you can definitely go like 10 days and you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be clean if you didn't overfeed if
you're using a soilless mix you might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to flush for like 14 days clean out that
rhizosphere clean everything out get the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to quit eating let them cannibalize
themselves now if you're using organics
[SPEAKER_00]: and you didn't put anything that was
buffered chelated in there it may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary to flush i cannot tell you you
don't need to flush because i don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to fuck up your grow but the plants aren't
eating anything unnecessary if the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are done and they know it is time if
they're in senescence they've stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: eating anyway they're just going to quit
eating they're going to cannibalize
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and they're going to fade off
like it is fall they're only supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be around for a year they don't expect to
live any longer so you may not need to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush also our friend subcool shout out to
subcool he used to whip up super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes and he would say i've been flushing
the whole time he would make a batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that in his experience would be
strong enough lively enough potent enough
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient rich enough to last the duration
of the grow he would start in a veg pot
[SPEAKER_00]: then right before a flower he would up
that pot into a larger pot with fresh soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in it those roots would grow into that and
eat all the nutrients in that soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the plant through its whole life all
he has to do is feed it water all i've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing is flushing the whole time is
what he would say so in that situation
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're saying he's been flushing the
entire time and the plant is not being
[SPEAKER_00]: force-fed it may not be necessary to
actually flush in that type of environment
[SPEAKER_00]: i am open to feedback i'm open to opinions
i'm open to education i am not the
[SPEAKER_00]: definitive answer of cannabis i'm still
learning just like you but these are my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions and my experience i think if
you're using bottled nutrients absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: do flush if you're not using buffered
chelated nutrients if you got a super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's not necessary to flush i'm not
going to tell you not to flush i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know for sure now let's talk about
something that i honestly i don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: real scientific botanical biological
education to open this can of worms but
[SPEAKER_00]: here is how my brain thinks about it the
things we have fed the plant aren't in
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant as nitrogen potassium
phosphorus cal magma lead in them that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff has been converted into plant
material plant matter bio mass if you will
[SPEAKER_00]: it has been photosynthesized and processed
into stuff um if i went and i ate uh seven
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand fucking snickers bars today if
you eat me if you smoke me it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: burning snickers bars there's not snickers
bars are not me i'm not snickers bars i am
[SPEAKER_00]: rasta jeff i am jeff i have converted all
of those snickers bars into biomass it's
[SPEAKER_00]: either fat it's fat is all it's gonna it's
fucking fat and diabetes is what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be and the rest of it was a poop so
i've converted into a turd and biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna find snickers bars in me
for maybe like for like an hour after i
[SPEAKER_00]: eat it you might find pieces of snickers
bars you'll identify peanuts for a real
[SPEAKER_00]: long time but i think the plants aren't
gonna have if you feed the plant snickers
[SPEAKER_00]: bars they're not gonna fucking have
snickers bars hanging off the branches
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna break down snickers bars it's
gonna kill your plant but follow me what
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm saying here it's not gonna be snickers
bars in the plant it's gonna metabolize
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn into biomass and plant matter
leaves stalks buds trichomes shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes it's gonna turn it esters paleo
it's gonna turn into all kinds of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars so i don't know that what are we
flushing out what are you trying to do you
[SPEAKER_00]: can only like if i tried to flush me i can
only pee and poop so much and only so much
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna come out after that i'm just
gonna piss and shit pure water uh what you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't then am i gonna smoke better am i
gonna burn better i don't know so i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're trying to get out you're
trying to flush out nutrients but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaves they're in the stalks the
buds have become buds it has turned all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your building blocks of life into a plant
so flushing is controversial and i wish i
[SPEAKER_00]: wish i had some science to back up the
part i'm talking about now there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have much better education
than me on that and i'm willing to admit
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys i'm not the most uh book and
school educator when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: but i've fucking done it i put my hands on
the plants i've done a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why i feel that i'm credible not to
discredit the school guys i need one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the school guys to back me up on this
question but uh in my opinion definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: flush with uh salt nutrients hydro
something like that maybe you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to flush if you're running organics my
question to you is uh what are you trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to flush out what are we trying to do we
want to clean rhizosphere so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants don't have a bunch of stuff in them
when we smoke it if you don't overfeed it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you didn't over fertilize it should
burn cleanly at the end maybe do an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment maybe grow one plant and don't
flush it and grow one plant and flush for
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days dry and cure exactly the same
let's smoke them at the end and see let's
[SPEAKER_00]: see if we really can tell let's see if
that shit we're blaming that crunchy ash
[SPEAKER_00]: on is something else other than just a
basic flush that's my two cents on that
[SPEAKER_00]: part i do have some feedback on one other
avenue of this question um i do know that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a commercial grow that had an
incident i can't get into their business
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to harvest a room a little bit
early and the plants in one section did
[SPEAKER_00]: not get to get flushed we thought we had
more time uh things went wrong uh had to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut down we decided instead of trying to
sell these unflushed flowers that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze it and turn it into fresh frozen
live resin that shit came out amazing we
[SPEAKER_00]: could not tell that those plants had not
been flushed the live resin that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: just not even flushed those plants
probably got fed that day and they got cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down they got froze they got turned into
concentrates and it tasted fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful so we did not notice anything in
the fresh frozen live resin from plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that were not flushed that's the only
thing i can testify to in that department
[SPEAKER_00]: so i wish i had a more definitive answer
to you but i hope i sparked your mind i
[SPEAKER_00]: gave you a little bit of guidance i want
to know what do we think we're flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: out like i keep saying all the stuff we
fed the plant became the plant it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: become like little bags of phosphorus and
potassium hanging off the plant it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: moving around as that still it's a plant
now so there's a lot to think about there
[SPEAKER_00]: i will continue to read i will always
continue to educate myself on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: what i do have a real solid definitive
answer on this i will be here on the show
