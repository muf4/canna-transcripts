[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for episode number 124 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_05]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_05]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for joining me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sitting at the table this week,
I got our good buddy, White Mike,
[SPEAKER_05]: is back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining me, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: And also in front of me, the lovely,
the Traveling Stoner, also known as
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, we're choking.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hitting the Hitman E-Series Sidecar
Rig with a bunch of Turpex, Triangle
[SPEAKER_05]: Killer, and Black Cherry Chem Hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the Black Cherrys, Tasty?
[SPEAKER_05]: My throat's going to sound like shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit for a couple of minutes here,
but you guys will have to bear with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be all right because this is
going to be a very fun episode,
[SPEAKER_05]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our friend Lindsay, the Traveling Stoner,
she's been on the show a couple of times
[SPEAKER_05]: here, a couple of rowdy episodes with a
bunch of boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: She sent me a text message with a whole
bunch of questions about politics and the
[SPEAKER_05]: upcoming elections and things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought the best thing we could do
is get White Mike over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: White Mike is kind of my political expert.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have a politics question,
Mike is the guy that I call.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody needs one of us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a new politics friend also in
Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant the guy that does your job in
Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good meeting you the other day at
the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for being on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed you on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, if you two got in the room together,
the cannabis opposition would be in some
[SPEAKER_05]: deep shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm dying to get to the Canyon Canyon
after that episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, if you haven't been there,
go check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at 1507 Colorado Boulevard in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you tell the lovely Camille that
Rasta Jeff sent you the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my literal favorite place to go in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: My grow is my home away from home.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when I have to go away from one
of those two, I go to the Canyon Canyon
[SPEAKER_05]: and turp out.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do it right, it's easy to
support.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do it right at the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: The place is classy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Total unintended shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're talking about this email that the
traveling stoner sent.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Mike here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that it would be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I kind of handed the... I'm not going
to let you be the host.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you be the co-host today.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be the unofficial co-host.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll pass you over that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want me to move the mic for you?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I like... I don't even know how to...
Just listen up right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, I can't even do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you just got to leave it where it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to do a little lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, we'll play this part right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That might help.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will that work?
[SPEAKER_05]: That works.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're fixing microphones live on the show,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get to hear some mic movement and
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just grab it and move it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll move now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it where you want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it even... No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until you play with the cord, you can't
even hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't hear myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how shit goes in our world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I hope you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the backstage view there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every show comes with a few technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my headphones aren't working.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were talking about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the... I'm going to wiggle this
and see if it cuts in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it coming?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it coming?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now you're screwing with mine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a piece that I bought at Guitar
Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Livewire Advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: H-A-O-4, four-channel stereo headphone
amp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got one, get it replaced because
it's going to crap out on you and cause
[SPEAKER_05]: you problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost blew Mike's head up a couple of
minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My ears are still ringing a little bit
from that volume spike.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the gear, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't doing it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need your ears for this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy the piece he said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, don't buy that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it a thumbs down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five rotten leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to get to something that
we're going to talk about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about some of these
questions that Lindsay typed very
[SPEAKER_05]: professionally and sent to me in a very
nice PDF.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is marvelous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been scratched down in a notebook
for two weeks, so I'm glad they look
[SPEAKER_00]: marvelous to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look good and tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you got a nice little PowerPoint thing
going on here?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to let you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is my friend Lindsay,
also known as the Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you follow her on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: She does a periscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a great chick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd like to watch her.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got tattoos and takes fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to kind of sit back and take
a couple of- Hey, I'm Team Dreadlocks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't forget to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got some Dreadlocks now,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's Team Dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Chris for putting in the
Dreadlocks for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, shout out to Chris.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike looks a little offended.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just wondering if you can be on
the team this early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, those are Dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the only reason you're right is
because- See, I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had long hair before, but I never
went dread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since she's had to deal with some
social stigma already, she's been harassed
[SPEAKER_05]: by somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's official.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's when you got your hat,
not when they went in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only ask because I watched what happened
when a dude got the dreadlocks worn for
[SPEAKER_04]: two festivals and then cut them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched the community revolt around
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: That happened years ago in college.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it just seemed like a good
question to hit you with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's comfortable on the show now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We said he was comfortable on the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I'll say anything now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about this table and
possibly something about dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's both.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's both.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the dab table.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've already gotten some serious-
Don't say that's too out of character
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already gotten some serious
negativity about them, some serious hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm already going to call myself Team
Dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got a nice little starter kit,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I'm going to kind of hand
you the hosting situation here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let you ask Mike some
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will definitely interject and drive the
show, but I'm going to sit back and take
[SPEAKER_05]: some dabs of some Triangle Killer from
Terpex while you guys chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So listeners, let her know how she does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send her some tweets, send her something
on Instagram or on Snapchat, or make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: you follow her on Periscope and let her
know what you thought of her performance
[SPEAKER_05]: here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, it's all yours, young lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea for this podcast actually
came from a trip coming over to Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: while I was moving here in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent most of the trip listening to the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I- Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And tell us where you came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you go from Florida to Colorado and
listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we actually went up to North
Carolina first and then came over too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had an extra long trip because it
was Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to go see my family in North
Carolina and then came over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it was a nice break for a
couple of days, but yeah, we definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot of podcasts listening in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of podcast show.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of stats moving for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why Scooby liked you so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I've heard this guy's voice
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Scooby the dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dog is the coolest little panda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, he really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so Chris and I were,
Bobo Blasterco and I were discussing about
[SPEAKER_00]: it the whole time that you guys really
needed to do a show about the upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: election and that pro marijuana people
need to know which candidate to vote for
[SPEAKER_00]: and which one will actually help marijuana
laws get put in place instead of helping
[SPEAKER_00]: us or making us take steps backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so a lot of my questions here are
about the upcoming election.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my question to you,
Mike, is what states look like they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing marijuana in the upcoming
election?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little too early to tell what the
vote's going to look like come November,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we already know that a number of
states are going to be voting on
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization or we've got a good list of
states where there are major groups that
[SPEAKER_04]: look like they've got a shot at getting it
on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in November or were states where
there's a legislative effort to get it on
[SPEAKER_04]: the ballot in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those states are Arizona, California,
Florida, Maine, Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Rhode Island,
and Vermont may all be voting on
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational marijuana this November.
[SPEAKER_04]: States voting on just medical Mississippi,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a shitload of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: States voting this November.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other states could make the list.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still plenty of time in most
states for either a ballot initiative or
[SPEAKER_04]: for people to lobby their legislatures
enough to get the vote on the ballot in
[SPEAKER_04]: November this year.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I wasn't expecting you to say
that many.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I had to make notes for the
first time ever when I got emailed this
[SPEAKER_04]: list of questions Jeff was talking about a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: That nerdy part of my brain got really
excited and I was like, this is the show
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been wanting to do and somebody did
the line of notes for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a nice long list of states there
and then you looked it the fuck over
[SPEAKER_04]: because you had medical on one side and
rec on the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed a front and a back side because
I've got notes on each state's effort too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't know how in depth you want to
go with this answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can really give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine because I mean, the articles
that I want to write, I wanted to do one
[SPEAKER_00]: on each state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to go through just a brief
thing on each state, that's totally cool
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to avoid the subject, but you just
said something that I've got to address.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to bust you out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, write articles, let our
listeners know where those articles are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to appear and who you represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Ms. Mary Jane Coe because
I am the new intern blog writer for them
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have been helping them get their
blog up and running and in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been writing the articles and stuff
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Ms. Mary Jane Coe and
Madison and Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the articles will be
eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're an intern?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't get paid?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what an internship is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right that you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right on for doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll work on a nice resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for supporting the community for
free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we all got to do our part, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll step back and let the show keep
moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were at, which states are voting on
legalization?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just about to run through a
brief little note on each or at least the
[SPEAKER_04]: little note that I made looking these up
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: This list came out in December or January
and already it's only March, but there's
[SPEAKER_04]: already been time for another state to
make this list.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think possibly for one to drop off
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But back when this was this official list
that I kind of snatched was published,
[SPEAKER_04]: Arizona folks, there's a group collecting
signatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need 150,000 signatures by July 7th.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make the 2016 vote in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: The initiative includes HomeGrowth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from what I could gather, they're going
to have a Colorado style system that
[SPEAKER_04]: includes HomeGrowth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of the states that are looking to
vote on legalization have HomeGrowth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each state has its own initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Its initiative comes with its own rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just saw Ohio vote on legalization and
vote against it mainly because of those
[SPEAKER_04]: special rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have had legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have been shopping in weed
stores, but chose not to because of who
[SPEAKER_04]: was going to profit the most from the
production end of that industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's written specifically for a
bunch of people in your state to make
[SPEAKER_04]: money, it's probably not going to pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: California could go either way.
[SPEAKER_04]: California never shies away from shooting
itself in the foot here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They led the way with medical in 96 and
that existed
[SPEAKER_04]: for a long time, but it's not going to
pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to pass.
It's not going to pass.
It's not going to pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that there's at least one other
one looking to be on the ballot competing
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Florida, two different groups are
collecting signatures right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: One for medical marijuana, one for full
legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both initiatives look really popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out and find signatures, people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find a place to sign and make sure you
vote November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to interject here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came really close last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like stupidly close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's funny, like I have
friends in Florida who would just complain
[SPEAKER_00]: about the fact that it didn't get
legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, oh, well, like,
who did you vote for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd be like, I didn't vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're upset.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you actually got to get out on
election day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think your vote doesn't matter,
the only way your vote doesn't matter is
[SPEAKER_05]: if you don't vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fucking vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to voting.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to dab all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go fucking vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's Florida, Maine, Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys might be voting on legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article I found on Maine didn't list
whether it was legislative or a ballot
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of made it sound like it was
already on the ballot in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you live in Maine, you need to
Google it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts legislative efforts are
underway for decriminalization that would
[SPEAKER_04]: include legal possession.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be legal to possess a certain
amount of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just decriminalization,
which means it's still sold from a black
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no taxes, no regulations, no lab
testing, none of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a group in Massachusetts
looking to put the full legalization on
[SPEAKER_04]: the ballot and they're collecting
signatures in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a group collecting signatures for
full legalization, including a 12 plant
[SPEAKER_04]: home grow, which would be double here in
Colorado, Michigan folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get out and find a place to sign that
petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Missouri, one group's collecting
signatures for a legalization effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look pretty good, but it's going to
take people turning out to vote for it in
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalization will be on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to those folks in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to jump in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know those folks in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Darrell and his wife,
Trish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the folks running the movement
out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met with them a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rhode Island and Vermont both have
legislative efforts for legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: underway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I didn't collect any detailed
notes on the medical efforts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised to see Mississippi on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ohio is still reeling from that major
loss last November.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't surprise me that they're
working on medical instead of another full
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ones that are for sure
already have major legalization groups or
[SPEAKER_04]: legislative efforts to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you heard your state on the list,
you either need to get out and sign that
[SPEAKER_04]: petition or hop on Google real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look up who your elected representative is
for your area, for your state legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to give that person a call or
email them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're shy at all, email them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super, super simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Write them a little letter and email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Mr. So-and-so, I'm one of your
voters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like you to vote yes on legalizing
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get in and start making the
arguments for them and helping them with
[SPEAKER_04]: that part of it too, you can in your
email.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be windy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Mr. So-and-so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please vote yes on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you need to write.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more people they hear that from,
the more likely they are to vote for you,
[SPEAKER_04]: to vote for what you're asking them to
vote for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take the time and do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a state where you need
signatures gathered to get it on the
[SPEAKER_04]: ballot, if the state requires 100,000
signatures, collect 300,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you sign the petition, make sure that
the petition signer knows that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see efforts fail to make the ballot
every year because they needed 100,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: They turn in 150,000, and then the state
decertifies 80,000, and they're short.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's happening in Maine right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in Ohio as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're gathering signatures for
marijuana, you need to gather triple the
[SPEAKER_04]: signatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredibly difficult to get this
stuff on the ballot for a ballot
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative, but it's doable if you do it
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how Colorado did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how a number of the other legal and
medical states have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this upcoming election, which
candidates does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will have the most positive influence on
the cannabis industry if they're elected
[SPEAKER_00]: into office?
[SPEAKER_04]: By far, Bernie.
[SPEAKER_04]: By miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: A distant second would be Hillary,
who will probably continue the nonsense
[SPEAKER_04]: we're dealing with now from Obama.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the Republican candidates are
either indifferent, or all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: candidates at this point that had outright
said that they would use their position as
[SPEAKER_04]: president to come in and shut down what
we're doing in Colorado and Washington and
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now Alaska.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're off.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've dropped out of the race.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten past that point in this
election.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good thing to know that at
this point, none of the candidates that
[SPEAKER_00]: are on there will try to shut it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, none of them have pledged to so far,
given the nature of politics, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: this fucking year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying that it hasn't happened yet is a
really safe bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: God only knows where the election is going
to go this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you thought politics were boring,
you're not watching the right news shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't out loud say that I endorse any
specific candidate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you were going to vote only based
on cannabis, you got to vote on Burn One.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely who you'd go for if
you're going to vote just on cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dude used to go to Grateful Dead
shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dude protested at so many,
if all those images I've seen are true.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're totally true.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're checked by major media outlets.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to vote for Bernie,
in November, you need to vote for Bernie
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Odds are your state already had its
primary caucus.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it hasn't yet, your ass needs to get in
front of a computer right now and Google
[SPEAKER_04]: what you have to do to participate in your
caucus.
[SPEAKER_04]: The odds are you're already locked out
because you didn't do this a month ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not true in like half of the
upcoming states or more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want a chance to vote for Bernie
in November, you need to get out and vote
[SPEAKER_04]: for him now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: For him to get the Democratic nomination,
it's going to be a lot of work and a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of people turning out who don't usually
turn out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your fan base.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my fan base.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to vote for Bernie in
November, you got to get out now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some states have primary votes where
you just go vote like you do in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each state's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of what you're Googling to see
how to participate in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't be that big pain in the ass and
it'll have major repercussions in
[SPEAKER_04]: November.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get out and do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't bitch if you don't vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were talking about the candidates
that are most pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can all agree that it's Mr.
Bernie Sanders right there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, by a mile.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if Bernie gets elected into office,
what does that mean for legal weed like
[SPEAKER_00]: across the nation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, his campaign pledge so far only goes
so far as to say he won't interrupt the
[SPEAKER_04]: experiments going on in legal states.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very set against the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's talked about decriminalizing
or legalizing it federally.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the record, this campaign, as a
president, he's got a couple of different
[SPEAKER_04]: options he could take.
[SPEAKER_04]: The president could sign an executive
order which would legalize it federally,
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Executive orders aren't federal law
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of contentious politics
involved with executive orders.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the executive order isn't a change in
federal law.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would still mean marijuana is illegal
federally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the president signed an order
saying who don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we really need to happen is an act of
Congress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whose president matters there is because
they get to a bully pulpit, is what they
[SPEAKER_04]: call it, where the president gets to say,
hey, guys in Congress, it would be a
[SPEAKER_04]: really good idea if you worked on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do it all the time with all kinds
of different shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no reason they can't do it
with, all right, you guys, we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out how to legalize marijuana this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do this, this, and this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he doesn't tell them what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your boss does it work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: With Obama, they just kind of look at him
and nod their heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then half of the people elected to
represent us have chose to do nothing for
[SPEAKER_04]: the last nine years and it's been a
fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But getting Bernie into the presidency and
paying attention to Senate races,
[SPEAKER_04]: this year major shifts in politics could
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over half of our elected representatives
in Washington DC right now are up for
[SPEAKER_04]: election.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we fire that many of them and replace
them with quality candidates that are even
[SPEAKER_04]: mildly pro cannabis, 2016 could be a
monumental year for legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the podcast just accidentally full
on endorsed Bernie Sanders.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're a pro marijuana person,
that's the logical, rational choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of arguments to be made
after that, but that's what you're looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred percent is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that's where your money in vote would
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very much not a one issue voter,
but marijuana legalization is very near
[SPEAKER_04]: and dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can see voting in an election like
this based purely on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My life is 98.7% funded by the
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's only like 25% true for me,
but like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's zero percent true for me,
but that's still like a big aspect for why
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm voting, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've studied this for so long and just
having it pro pro prohibited, just that
[SPEAKER_04]: concept in our law has ruined so many
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's infected every part of American life
from politics to medicine, to how we
[SPEAKER_04]: interact with each other, our neighbors,
the police, how they, how the police
[SPEAKER_04]: interact with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's just poisoned everything it's
touched and it's touched everything and it
[SPEAKER_04]: has to stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it stops this election year when
people under 30 turn out and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will hopefully happen a lot more
this year than it has in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen so many people turning out for
caucuses and voting pro Bernie in a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: places.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been sending records for caucus
attendances, attend caucus attendance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, there are going to be a lot of
new voters out there this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are more than usual energized,
but we've seen this before.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a political junkie, they refer
to it as getting due caucus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a guy who could have been president
and everybody thought he was going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the college kids were going to
vote for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he lost in a fucking landslide to
a nightmare of a Republican.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernie's really, really popular and he
could, he could lose in a landslide to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Republican nominee, whoever that ends up
being.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, we don't let it be Trump.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he could lose to Hillary in the
primary and we could be voting Hillary
[SPEAKER_04]: versus somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what that means for legalization
is very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trump just is fucking crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to, I was not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're fucking living a Mad Max movie
inside four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already, and I know everyone says
this, but like I've already let it be very
[SPEAKER_00]: well known that I will probably leave the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have family in England.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, but you've got a lifeboat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might, I might actually jump ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've always wanted to go
backpacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like do the Europe thing anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, thanks for helping me make that
decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I don't know what I'm going to do if
that dude gets elected because yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude, I'm going to ride the boat till it
crumbles.
[SPEAKER_05]: My life will change.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is an absolute thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my next question actually goes
to both of you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realistically is legalizing marijuana
across the nation, something we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for myself, I can say yes,
but I know that my reasons, and I guess I
[SPEAKER_00]: would rather hear both of yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to go for it or do you want me
to take it first?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great thing for legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who are doing it right are
going to be able to do it right across the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people that want to come in and
take over or come in and corporatize can't
[SPEAKER_04]: compete.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know any beer drinkers who
would be pumped if another Coors Light
[SPEAKER_04]: came on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of beer drinkers who are
pumped regularly about some small craft
[SPEAKER_04]: brewery coming on market.
[SPEAKER_04]: People who build up quality and churn out
quality are what we need in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Federal legalization opens up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the lab testing problem goes away
overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can use the same labs to test the
cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pesticide problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pesticide goes over, goes out
overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Immediately, the pesticide manufacturers
are able to run the studies needed to put
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis on the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the ones that already know they can,
because it's on the label for tobacco,
[SPEAKER_04]: will have those studies done in hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the seizure studies would be able
to be done for the children.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that medical research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Children and adults that have epilepsy,
hashtag Terps for Tots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that Marlboro's going to come in and
plant 500 acres worth of shitty weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: roll it up and throw it on the shelf at
6.5% pre-rolled joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a fucking little pack, and it's going
to be cute, and it's going to eat a part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the market for people who don't know
any better, but I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too much benefit to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's completely federally legal,
and there are places, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: compare it to the beer model like you did,
there's a cannabis manufacturer that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: same size as Bush or Coors producing mass
produced cannabis, turp-free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there are still niche gardens like
Green and Healthy Wellness and a few
[SPEAKER_05]: others.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few other shops that I've
totally would shop at and buy their
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that those shops are still
going to survive with that large market
[SPEAKER_05]: like the Coors type of stores that are
coming out?
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be a section of them that get
bought up, because when a Marlboro or a
[SPEAKER_04]: Coors, or fuck those companies,
but you get what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they step in, they don't create from
the ground up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look at you, they see what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hit you in the face with a check
bigger than you've ever imagined.
[SPEAKER_04]: You walk away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They replicate your business model.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a franchise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's going to be the people who do
this because they love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to not sell out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to slowly expand.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a million people who wish they
could just hop online and order your seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: that can't because it's not legal
federally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a federal offense to mail those to
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that goes away overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can just hop online, buy your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And enjoy life 100% legally without having
to worry about shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The benefit for the industry sky high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, there was just a report that
the legal industry is worth $4.4 billion
[SPEAKER_04]: this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to grow to $40 billion by 2020
if states continue to legalize like they
[SPEAKER_04]: have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last estimate I read on the black
market was Americans are spending $60
[SPEAKER_04]: billion on marijuana right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You figure a third or more that's the
black market markup.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry is worth $44, $45 billion
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're able to export to England every
now and again or whatever else is other
[SPEAKER_04]: countries start to legalize and the demand
for American quality cannabis spreads
[SPEAKER_04]: around the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That growth is exponential.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea that you're going to get squeezed
out if you're good at what you're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're a competent business owner is
just not there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I want to choke the fucking
stoners against legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see people every day online that are
actively lobbying against whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization efforts going on in their
area because it legalizes marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere in between alcohol and tobacco,
not like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only produce so much of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are rules on if you produce it in
your home, who you can sell it to or give
[SPEAKER_04]: it away to or not be allowed to sell it
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something I was going to definitely
mention is you got to be careful when it
[SPEAKER_05]: goes federally legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to be careful about what we get,
what we ask for, because there needs to be
[SPEAKER_05]: certain rules about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're all limited to six plants,
that's going to fuck some things up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need usable numbers, more viable plant
numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need just a little better rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes time, we got to be careful
that we get the right stuff that we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird in Colorado right now,
especially when we're extrapolating to
[SPEAKER_04]: federal legalization, because right now
those rules really help keep the idiots
[SPEAKER_04]: from fucking this up for all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Already, we've got major problems,
mostly PR problems, like nobody's been
[SPEAKER_04]: hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Massive outdoor grows that piss off the
neighbors, that lead to articles in the
[SPEAKER_04]: press about what bastards we are and how
the system is being manipulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of that leads to major blowback that
has political ramifications, including our
[SPEAKER_04]: area possibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're voting to ban the legal marijuana
industry this November.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a real fucking possibility,
mainly because there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: blowback lately about huge outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: People with a 20 and 30 plant count doing
20 or 30 VW bus sized plants in their
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking suburban backyard like a douche
bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it pisses all the neighbors off and it
looks terrible in the press.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to lead to sick kids losing
out on their medicine because caregivers
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to get quashed here in about
five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already pushing the caregiver
model out of the Colorado business plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already going away.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's really time, if you care about
marijuana legalization or you want to be
[SPEAKER_04]: part of this industry, to really start
paying attention and getting involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now everything is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually becoming legal everywhere,
very slowly, but it's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're moving forward every two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people turn out and vote and the
numbers that they can Facebook post,
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernie wins in a landslide, huge numbers
of congressmen get replaced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually make major progress on
marijuana law for the first time federally
[SPEAKER_04]: in 80 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can be a part of that revolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you got to do is get out there and
vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already told you who to vote for
accidentally.
Accidentally.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really didn't intend to endorse a
specific candidate for the beginning of
[SPEAKER_04]: this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if your only vote topic is marijuana,
you really got to vote for Bernie.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so then I guess that kind of leads
right there into my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What serious changes will occur if Bernie,
a pro marijuana candidate, is elected into
[SPEAKER_00]: office, like federally and statewide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it'll change the drug
classification of it, which will mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be able to be studied and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The change at the federal level is just so
huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be able to put our money in a
bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've spent 80 years thinking up ways to
make it harder to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every single one of those rules is
still in place for the legal industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And changing the federal law lets us
change all of those, the banking,
[SPEAKER_04]: the lab testing, the packaging
requirements, the state line rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get five calls a week at the shop about
people wondering where the buy now button
[SPEAKER_04]: is on our website.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You buy everything online now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably not going to be buying
weed online now anytime soon, but it
[SPEAKER_04]: should be there like everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can be if it's federally legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just changing who the president is,
it's sort of like the first step.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not how we get this battle won
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next best step.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real change happens, like regardless
of who gets elected the next election,
[SPEAKER_04]: calling your state legislatures,
calling your state senators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Google it, figure out who they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their job to listen to bullshit when
people call them and yammer at stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their job.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for people that live from whatever
area of the country they're from,
[SPEAKER_04]: call and talk to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's their job to listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's their job to go pass laws
based on how many people call them that
[SPEAKER_04]: week and said, vote yes or vote no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So literally this stuff matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a number of areas, cities,
towns, counties that are voting on
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana legalization far ahead of their
states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw New Orleans decriminalized it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Louisiana is never going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But New Orleans just passed a law,
maybe not full decriminalization,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they just did some sentencing reform
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been posting a story all week of
about a dude who got 13 years for two
[SPEAKER_04]: joints in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of there's three strikes in your
fuck law.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's enough hash on this table to lock
up everyone in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miami, Florida decriminalized it last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't this year earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think anything cities, towns and
counties everywhere are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're doing it because the local
officials in those areas got swamped with
[SPEAKER_04]: pro marijuana supporters calling,
hey, I'm a voter in your district.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pro marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's legalize it in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough people called.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough people got active.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what everybody listening to the
show needs to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you live in another country,
unless it's like North Korea, odds are
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got a system of representative
government of some sort.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do a lot of this, too,
because I know we've got listeners in
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're listening from North Korea,
please send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to know if you're listening in
Korea podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also huge shout out to our supporter
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we've got several, but we've got
one guy out there that is a huge
[SPEAKER_05]: supporter.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, my Rasta friend?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, get involved, get active,
because there's a lot you can do even on a
[SPEAKER_04]: local level.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you live in a state that's never going
to legalize it, you might live in a city
[SPEAKER_04]: that will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Austin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your opinion, out of the states that
have legalized marijuana already,
[SPEAKER_00]: which state is doing it right in the way
of laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who has a good set of laws put in
place to make a cannabis industry actually
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and not have issues?
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them are perfect yet, but I tend
to it might be biased, but I took a quick
[SPEAKER_04]: glance at the rules again today and I vote
Colorado by a mile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington's drastically overtaxing
marijuana and has caused all sorts of
[SPEAKER_04]: price issues and issues industry wide
between the city, the state, the county
[SPEAKER_04]: and the federal sales taxes that the legal
marijuana industry pays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a statewide tax rate of 30-35% is
enough to keep the shop from being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: profit at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's terrible for the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeps it on the black market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the shops can't profit, they can't pay
their people what they're worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't provide insurance.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't reinvest in their business and
there's no reason to get involved in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stay in the black market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The black market will be fine,
just like it was last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It always exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never going away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Oregon's got its own issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole new set of issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whole new set of issues as of yesterday,
but Colorado's far from perfect too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird social clubs are a very gray area in
our law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some areas allow them.
[SPEAKER_04]: No area has shops up and running where
they're allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Springs just voted to ban all the
shops, but gave them eight years to shut
[SPEAKER_04]: down, which is- Yeah, they're going to
leave them alone for eight years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're too dangerous to allow to
continue to exist, so they have to shut
[SPEAKER_04]: them down, but they gave them eight years
before they have to close.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually said that they're going to
vote again within that eight years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're probably going to vote at
least eight times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we can turn it around there.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you guys are writing the rules in
your state or city or county or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: it may be on your island, in your bubble,
when you're making the rules for your
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis laws, be sure to include some
sort of way to consume that cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: legally and safely with your friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are places to go to drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can all go gather.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can name 12 places within five minutes
of here that we can all go get drunk until
[SPEAKER_05]: we fucking die, but there's nowhere that
we can other than right here at this table
[SPEAKER_05]: that we can all congregate and safely
consume cannabis without any problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take it as a given, but there's a huge
contingent of people out there that want
[SPEAKER_04]: no rules, and they think that's possible,
and it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana might be the most safe
intoxicant known to mankind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be the most beneficial plant
known to mankind.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of that means you're going to
legalize it to be produced in the home at
[SPEAKER_04]: any amount with no regulation or no rules
as to how or where it can be grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll never be able to grow it like
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: At best, you'll be able to produce it like
home brew alcohol works.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some of those rules, honestly,
with the abuses we see just in the legal
[SPEAKER_04]: states that are going now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are idiots everywhere, and we kind
of have to set up the rules for the
[SPEAKER_04]: slowest link.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the guy growing eight-foot tall
trees in his backyard here in our
[SPEAKER_05]: neighborhood, and some kids tried to steal
his trees, and he shot them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God it was a fucking pellet gun,
but there's been others.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are home invasion robberies because
they've got a ridiculous grow going,
[SPEAKER_04]: and yeah, it's legal here, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats, bro, but it's not legal estate
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in fact worth 8,000 a pound,
and you've got $400,000 worth of marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: in your suburban backyard in the ghetto.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your life 12 times over,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did you put yourself at risk,
everybody else in your house at risk,
[SPEAKER_04]: your neighbors at risk, but you shot the
whole movement in the foot at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly don't want my fucking kid
climbing over your fence and stealing your
[SPEAKER_04]: weed when he's 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make him fucking hassle bums like I had to
do with Boost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was getting gas today, and a dude who
looked well, had decent shoes and looked
[SPEAKER_05]: clean, he's like, bro, you got an extra
cup of bowls?
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at him like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know what to think,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too big an ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spare change, not do you have $47.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of extra bowls?
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had a Rojo to hook you up,
am I going to throw in a couple of extra
[SPEAKER_05]: bowls?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if I had a Nug, I might have thrown
it his way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but a Nug is a bowl, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about offering him ... I was
like, you should just get in the car and
[SPEAKER_05]: take the biggest fucking dab you've ever
had, is what I thought about doing to the
[SPEAKER_05]: kid, but it wasn't the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't seem right at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got more questions for White Mike?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple more questions on the
list, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, Mike got the list also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everyone's got the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what other states accept other
states medical cards?
[SPEAKER_04]: They call that reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only state that I know that does that
is Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and they accept all other states or
just a select few?
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I'm aware, Nevada has medical
marijuana dispensaries except medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana cards from all other states,
which is great for the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: industry in Nevada because last I checked,
they had like 10 or 14,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: That just changed a lot of cool things
because one of our very good friends is
[SPEAKER_05]: getting married there on the 23rd of July.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been invited to their wedding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that means that I can travel and I
can stop at a dispensary and I can pick up
[SPEAKER_05]: some products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't wanted to go to Vegas since I
was like 24.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I suddenly, it's back on the list of
the to-dos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Arnie and Reve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats on the wedding, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been to Vegas, so that might
have to happen soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely do it a couple of times
before you die.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just told everybody that I'll be in
Vegas on July 23rd.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't wanted to go to Vegas and think
about drinking and legal weed or legal
[SPEAKER_04]: access to my medical marijuana,
to be more specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think being high will improve your
gambling?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by miles.
Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm not a drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say about the
smoking clubs thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge thing for me because I don't
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't drank in maybe two or three
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really do anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smoking is really important to me and
being able to have somewhere to go and to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that I can go to other states
and consume cannabis without having any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues or anything is a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Matt that said on a past
episode that they made bars so that you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have people drinking on the streets
all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to make cannabis social clubs so
that we're not out in our car trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: dab at the fucking Safeway parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get a DUI.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to go park between two trucks on
your lunch break or some stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalization doesn't exist in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be practicable just like
everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of people who live in
places where they can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of people who live in
situations where they can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about to be in one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gets cold fucking in Colorado
during the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you need places to go where you can
legally consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be standing out in an
alley if you don't have to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no reason to have that be the
legal consumption method.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking hate tourists or town tourists.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just go to the back of the hotel
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have a better answer than that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go smoke out your car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love the points that got made on
that show, that last show at Canyon Canyon
[SPEAKER_04]: about we've got kids now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't necessarily want to explain that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do that on my own time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to have to explain that shit
in the park or fucking anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Signs are one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are those guys doing over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we go do that, Dad?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to skip those questions for as long
as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there are consumption clubs,
that conversation only comes up like that
[SPEAKER_04]: if I'm at a consumption club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's fucking on me because I've
got my 12 year old in the consumption
[SPEAKER_04]: club.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the douchebag in that situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the guy smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, they will not let a 12 year old.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not even possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can fully have your 12 year old in the
bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to lay that out on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can totally do that in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really got to be hard to telling
people that about the hotel because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them at risk too, because if a cop
were to catch them smoking out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: open, they get, you know, they still get a
fine or whatever it is here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a friend who got caught smoking in
a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have anywhere to be for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: He parked underneath the stoplight or the
just the light, the street light there and
[SPEAKER_05]: was chilling out, loaded himself up a bowl
and took a couple of puffs off the bowl as
[SPEAKER_05]: he was blown out of hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cop walked up to his window and knocked on
his window.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had no choice but to roll down the
window and let the smoke billow onto the
[SPEAKER_05]: cop's face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all he did was write him an illegal
possession of cannabis ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he kind of chewed them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, you can't fucking smoke here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my buddy's like, I was just waiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have anywhere to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't fucking smoke here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our buddy's fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was 44's fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there had been a place for him to
go where he could safely consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: 44 and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there had been a place for him to like
safely consume cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that wouldn't have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole situation wouldn't have
happened for most people that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for our friend 44 and two,
that still would have happened that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I hate situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be more hotels that cater to
the level of tourists coming through
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just that part of the industry
hasn't caught up yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, consumption clubs solve a
couple hundred different questions about
[SPEAKER_04]: how legal marijuana works.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a dispensary in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the dispensary I work for is not a
recreational store, it's a medical only.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you about Emerald Fields in
Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to be in the Manitou
Springs, Colorado Springs area and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for recreational cannabis,
I would send you to Emerald Fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the vibe and the experience of the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unlike any other recreational
dispensary I've ever been to.
[SPEAKER_05]: The place was really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a neat vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little overpriced because it's
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm used to paying member pricing over
at Green and Healthy, but the place was
[SPEAKER_05]: cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right down the street, there is a 420
friendly hotel in Manitou.
[SPEAKER_05]: They advertise that they are 420 friendly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not going to kick you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can smoke in the rooms
or if they've got like a designated 420
[SPEAKER_05]: area, but it advertises 420 friendly on
the sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically if you're coming to
Colorado and you plan to consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: the best thing you can do is call around
to several different hotels and just
[SPEAKER_04]: straight up ask them what their marijuana
policy is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't use euphemisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let there be any confusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gotten this phone call eight times
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: The person on the other end should just
give you a rote response.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody from Emerald Fields or that
hotel heard any of that, you can kindly
[SPEAKER_05]: send an email with a check in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, just call and ask what's your
marijuana policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll tell you that they'll kick you out
for consuming on property and a story.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll tell you that they don't allow you
to consume inside, but they have a smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: patio.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is one hotel on the south side of
Pueblo that is cannabis friendly,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I cannot recall which hotel it was
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I used to send people to,
I sent a guy to the other night and I got
[SPEAKER_04]: a call back maybe 45 minutes after I had
this conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, no, they said they're not
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he yelled at me and I had to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I felt really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, dude.
My bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Colorado's got the best set of
laws so far in my opinion, but we've still
[SPEAKER_04]: got some serious, serious holes in our law
right now that need to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a couple of classier hotels in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I even want to say the
names of the places.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go for the cannabis cup and when we go
for the cup, we get expensive hotels,
[SPEAKER_05]: not to be an asshole.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we would go up to Denver,
we would go get fucking high-end hotels.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would be kind of assholes about it and
eat lunch on the balcony.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a work trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoil yourself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you told the people at the desk,
you're like, so what's the smoking fee?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, it's $500 here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be here for three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's eight of us throwing out like 40
bucks each or 50 bucks each or what is
[SPEAKER_05]: that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do math this quickly while I'm
talking about it, but if we divide the,
[SPEAKER_05]: we all divided the smoking fee.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, can you just bill us for that
and not fuck with us?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just let us pay the $500 smoking
what they were going to charge us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're going to smoke this bitch out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just let us do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other hotels that won't let you
smoke them out, but some of, or all of
[SPEAKER_04]: their rooms have balconies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them are more or less lenient
with just go out on the balcony and puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Others have straight up told people,
just go to the back of our parking lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I drive by one of them,
I see like three people standing in this
[SPEAKER_04]: parking lot just in the back corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Warwick has killer balconies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can, that's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: The balcony at the Warwick is rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a little smoking club in
Denver called I bake or I baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys ever been?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been, but I've heard a lot of
good things, but have not been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I visited Colorado twice before I moved
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both times that I visited,
I tried to go there and like they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: open until noon or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my, my overly excited woke up too
early, you know, so I was not prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: something to not be open till noon and I
was not ready to wait to smoke a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoked it in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, but yeah, so I have never
actually been there, but apparently that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really chill, like no entry fee,
no nothing place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're ever in Denver and you want
to check that place out, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a cannabis smoking club.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bake.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hit my PayPal.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, there's a bunch of speakeasy
style cannabis clubs around Denver and
[SPEAKER_04]: other cities in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just, if they were legal,
it'd be simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I shout out the Canna Canyon all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really had fun at the dab lounge a
couple of weekends ago with Steve DeFino
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the veteran farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went to the speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the 420 speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's next door to the lazy lion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a completely different vibe than both
places.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a big stage and there was a band
playing and they're pool tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed all three of those clubs
on a different level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just prefer the Canna Canyon because
it's got this hardwood floors,
[SPEAKER_05]: leather couches.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just classy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always explain the smoking clubs in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to go with people who
you're trying to, I wouldn't even say
[SPEAKER_00]: distract, but there's a lot of TVs and a
lot of things to do at the lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't necessarily have to interact
with people.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dab lounge is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but Canna Canyon, Canyon is where you
go with your like true friends to like sit
[SPEAKER_00]: down and talk and actually have like a
real conversation because there really
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't any TVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some music and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really go there for the atmosphere
and the cannabis and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: The music is kept at a real quiet level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the hostess is usually Camille
and she's, she'll bring you bottles of
[SPEAKER_05]: water if you cough too hard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I hope to see like all over Colorado
slowly start to spring up is places where
[SPEAKER_04]: people can go with their friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Socialize a little bit, consume some
cannabis safely out of public view,
[SPEAKER_04]: like away from people who aren't
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just that simple and it's
someplace to wait for the fucking cab or
[SPEAKER_05]: the Uber, you know, where people can
safely consume cannabis and hang out with
[SPEAKER_05]: a whole bunch of their friends and meet
Adam ill this table, the secret session
[SPEAKER_05]: Denver, Colorado on 420 hosted by Gatsby
gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was supposed to shut that out at the
start of the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike will be working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's got to do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout it to the Grammy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for all the love, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually just confirmed our DJ.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been talking about the DJ that we
might get.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just confirmed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to get permission, uh,
from the people that are hosting the event
[SPEAKER_05]: before I can announce the DJ on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a, we've got a good DJ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I asked one of my favorite rappers to
come rap and crickets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get Yoda dabbed again?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God, we're not going to go there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, shout out to highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Young lady, you want the show back?
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of took over on accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we had a couple more questions or
did we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think we're right at one hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in that fine spot between two dabbed
and not dabbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's usually how I love.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm either too high for this shit or not
high enough for this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, the last three questions are
what we had talked about that they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: shows in themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I don't mean we can do a round two
of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I think we should do is let the
listeners listen
[SPEAKER_05]: to this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you guys have any questions or
things that you'd like us to do,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll answer them in the next episode out
of all three of those plus listener
[SPEAKER_05]: comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring you guys both back for round two,
uh, in two or three weeks or so,
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe like episode one 27 to one 30
ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ballpark it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you never know what could happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: There could, the shit goes on in my world.
[SPEAKER_05]: This, this podcast, you guys, I had a
whole nother show planned and this podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: happened today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, this was, I love the way my life
goes and the way that this podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys love it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Mike, how can people follow you on
social media?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you can find me two places,
uh, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter or,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I run a Pueblo for sensible cannabis
laws, Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, hit me up on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for basically any
cannabis legalization news, a lot of it's
[SPEAKER_04]: local, but I do nationwide and,
uh, worldwide when it's good news,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can tell he knows a lot of buzzwords
and knows his shit when it comes to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis legislation nationwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: He really focuses on the state and the
local, but he knows his shit all
[SPEAKER_05]: statewide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of like a heroin junkie in that
fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I wake up in the morning,
one of the first things I do is hop online
[SPEAKER_04]: and check a couple of different really
good news sources, uh, for what's going on
[SPEAKER_04]: in marijuana today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I have to like, it's a fucking
compulsion after all these years when I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't get to do it in the morning all day
at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I get to read the fucking paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it's digital.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not just getting the Denver post.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read like 17 or 18 different newspapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to classify the amount of news
as a paper, um, a day just following this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff is a compulsion now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I do all the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I share to that Facebook page or,
um, some of the stuff gets up on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you follow that Facebook page
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also check them out on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you follow Mike on Twitter from this
podcast, uh, tag Mike, tag the podcast and
[SPEAKER_05]: tell him I heard about you through the GFY
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let him know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he likes to know where his listeners
and followers are coming from.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my followers, uh, follow me
because I regularly smack anti marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: people on Twitter and that gets you a
bunch of really weird follows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then every day, every now and
again at two in the morning, I'll get a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of random follows when I haven't
been on Twitter in six days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to think it's a podcast thing,
but I never fucking know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So answer that question for me,
please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be like, Hey Mike, Hey at Nemo punk.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the number 15?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: At Nemo punk 15 at Nemo punk 15,
we found you on the, and then at GFY
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to do it in a tweet,
you can do it in a message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, whatever you let the guy know.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the wife and kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out babies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can people follow you on the social
media?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Instagram and periscope are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my Twitter is traveling stoner and
then my Snapchat is traveling stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: without the G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone went and snatched up all of the
traveling stoner on a certain amount of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, social media sites that I didn't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, so yeah, so it's all over the
place, but those are them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a blog intern for Miss Mary Jane Co.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Miss Mary Jane Co.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Miss Mary Jane Co.

[SPEAKER_05]: The other ganja girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we should explain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so she posted a picture to Instagram
of her and Bobo Blastoco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her and I saw that on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her and Bobo Blastoco were on a hike and
they post a picture and she tags it ganja
[SPEAKER_05]: girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really popular hashtag.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, he's the sexiest ganja
girl of all, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a beard like and a mustache.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is, it's appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my girlfriends called it out and
she was like, Oh my God, what cute ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she immediately wrote like,
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm, I sometimes I get really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm funny on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really sorry.

[SPEAKER_05]: Don't apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobo, what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're my favorite ganja girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could easily be a 420 nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was the visual I needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only seen one photo and I took that
photo and I just threw the fucking ganja
[SPEAKER_04]: nurse out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you know who Bobo Blastoco is and now
you're imagining, imagining him as a 420
nurse.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that fur and those little green
crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leaning over giving you a dab with his
little nurse hat on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, shout out to Sloppy for the,
uh, the man size dad that he tried to take
[SPEAKER_05]: with me yesterday.

outs here, but big, big, huge shout out

[SPEAKER_05]: I moves us up in the rankings.
[SPEAKER_05]: More people will see us.

the world.

at a time.
