[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 383 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of goat power
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at their Pueblo Medical
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label on this concentrate says
it is 74.8% THC and 86.4% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have ever smelled or smoked a
golden goat, this is exactly what golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a fresh smell so I can give
you a fair description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of citrus, not
overpowering citrus, but it does have a
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus base to it with a tropical
pineapple and a juicy fruit gum sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma on top of it minus that stickiness
that a juicy fruit piece of gum would
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's weird to say something smells
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that stickiness is part of the
flavor and aroma of the gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that tropical sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of pineapple, mostly a
citrus and tropical fruit sort of a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really describe it as a orange
pineapple tropical fruit Jolly Rancher
[SPEAKER_00]: would probably be the most accurate
description that I could nail it down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a beautiful golden color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just the right amount of
diamonds, just the right amount of sauce
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful goat power from our
friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously it has got me amped up and
ready to talk my face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: in-depth grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In episode 351, we talk about setting a
goal for the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about picking a space for the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about the appropriate
equipment and setting up the growth safely
[SPEAKER_00]: and effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we work our way through getting
clones and starting a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we're all the way to week
four of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
weeks four, five and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower or if you're new to
the podcast, I suggest you head back to
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 351 and start with the grow
lessons there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an experienced grower or if you
feel like you were up to speed or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been following along, let's jump
right into a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we're going to focus on
episodes four, five and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point of flowering, it should be
obvious where the bud sites are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have little buds popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should look like little dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to actually form into
buds by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be clearly obvious where the
buds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should also be more than obvious which
plants are males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the males better be gone by now or
you have pollinated everything and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a seeded crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the males are gone at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, your buds are starting to
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing little pistol, hairy covered
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to get minimal bud mass at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also coming out of that rapid
stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first three weeks of flowering,
our plants really like to stretch and take
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty much over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are still going to get taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that top bud grows gigantic,
but that rapid stretch phase is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to worry so much about the
plants just taking off on us anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stop stretching and
they're going to start focusing their
[SPEAKER_00]: energy more on developing the fat chunky
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want now at this point, if you don't
have a carbon filter, it is really time to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a carbon filter in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any air exiting the grow,
going outside that the neighbors may
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, you need a carbon filter by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to start getting really
aromatic from here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your odor under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very common way for your garden to be
discovered is for the aroma to be noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: by a neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neighbors call the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police driver on the block,
they narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they hit the front porch,
they can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a legal state, they want to
count your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got law enforcement in the house,
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a non-legal area,
if whoever shows up at your front door
[SPEAKER_00]: feels that they have got probable cause to
come into your house, they can come.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can discover your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be handy with the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may speak well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know how to keep them out of the
house for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the aroma was strong enough,
if the suspicion was strong enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to contact the judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have a warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in several days, they will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pull off the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will come in armed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be scary as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will destroy your entire garden and ask
questions later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is the time to have a carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be thinking about safety and
security if you are growing in a legal or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't even notice how pungent
your garden is because you're there every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first time the mailman walks in
front of the house and catches a little
[SPEAKER_00]: whiff, he's going to know exactly what
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time a little bit of aroma wafts
out of your grow and hits your neighbor
[SPEAKER_00]: right in her nose, she's going to know
exactly what that aroma is immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this scenario, we are only four weeks
into flower and our plants are beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: By weeks seven, eight, and nine,
it is going to be pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we start harvesting these
plants and trimming the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that aroma is going to increase
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add that extra stress to yourself by
stinking up the entire neighborhood with
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that buying a carbon filter
and an extraction fan sound like just
[SPEAKER_00]: another expense to a new grower,
but I would much rather invest that money
[SPEAKER_00]: in a filter and a blower than my lawyer
and bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I've made my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have one now, it is time to
start taking the steps to get a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that's a good
overview of what's going on in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds are showing, the stretch phase is
over, and it is starting to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the environment in
our grow for weeks four, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a daytime temperature for weeks four,
five, and six, I would suggest a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you can dial it in a little
tighter, I would like to be between 74 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now during the night, I would suggest a
temperature in the range of 60 to 70
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can dial it in nice and tight,
I would recommend 65 to 68 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to suggest no more than a
10 degree difference in your day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is if your day temperature
is 77 degrees, you don't want your night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature any lower than 67 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to see any more than a 10
degree diurnal temperature variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we allow drastic temperature drops in
the night cycle, we will slow down the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth and we will also encourage
powdery mildew development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, during the day, we want to be
between 70 and 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, we want to be between 60 and 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as time goes on, we are going to want
to reduce the temperature of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in flower, we want to make the room
a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are struggling to get the room
to 74 at this point, maybe just keep it up
[SPEAKER_00]: there at 78, 79 degrees so that when weeks
eight and nine come around, we can reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: that temperature down to as low as you can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lowest you can get it is 74,
let's wait until weeks eight and nine to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it there and leave it around 77 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know a lot of people are going to
say, why do we want to make it cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about a plant outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the seasons change, it gets colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows, oh shit, the end of the season
is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will encourage the plant to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also encourage beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also encourage more terpene
production, heat and light, break down
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not make it a little bit cooler
where we can preserve a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel that that little bit of cold
toward the end will increase in density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get tighter, more dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also will help reduce humidity and late
in flower, we need a little bit less
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity because we've got those big
chunky buds and we don't want to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: bud rot in the middle of our flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing the temperature later in
flower has many advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that not all rooms are set up
to be able to reduce the temperature late
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be running a perpetual cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just simply may not have the equipment
to get it that cool in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a little bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tip and trick that may help
increase aroma and color and density,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also help you avoid powdery mildew and
boy tritus toward the end of your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I suggest reducing the
temperature late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk more about that as we move
through these grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: For weeks four, five, and six,
I suggest 40% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reduced the humidity by 10% from
last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need as much moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to develop buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds act like sponges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will gather all of that moisture in
the air, which will lead to boy tritus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our worst nightmare when we get
giant buds in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's reduce the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it down to about 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For weeks four, five, and six,
I know I don't give detailed information
[SPEAKER_00]: when I talk about nutrients in these grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I don't know what brand of
nutrients you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using powder
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're running organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what you have chosen to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be too specific with the nutrient
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can do is make sure we cover the
bases and I give you a solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the things I would make sure
to have in my nutrient mix for weeks four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running bottles, you need a
basic bloom nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a bottle that says bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a bottle that says bloom A
and a bottle that says bloom B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottles are what we need for this
stage of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that those bottles have
three numbers printed on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an NPK value.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of flowering, we do not need
a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need a lot of nitrogen to provide
energy to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of flowering, we need more
phosphorus and potassium than we have
[SPEAKER_00]: previously needed in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will see a low N number and higher
P and K value numbers on your bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing with bottles,
hopefully your bloom base has covered your
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also need CalMag at this phase of
the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend enzymes and microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also introduce a kelp product to
my feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think kelp has a lot of great benefits
that we will talk about in a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a great time to start
introducing a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know what products you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what brand you have chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most bottle nutrients offer a very obvious
bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start implementing that
into your feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to provide energy to
your plants, you can feed them a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate product at this stage of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbohydrates will give the plants
energy and the carbohydrates will also
[SPEAKER_00]: feed your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing with veg bloom powdered
nutrients, I would have added Shine by
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely would put Shine in there by
week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is basically the time I start tapering
off the microbe products and start adding
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bloom booster products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots should be big and fat and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the plant is done,
I want that plant to be nearly root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are well on our way to filling that
pot with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to start focusing on moving
that energy up top and making big giant
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through weeks four, five and six,
I start tapering off the microbes and I
[SPEAKER_00]: start increasing the bloom booster
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now be careful with your bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to overfeed the bloom
booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most bottle nutrient companies have a very
clear suggested dose printed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time that is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to feed your plants too much
so that you have to buy more of their
[SPEAKER_00]: product more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that a new grower starts
off with 50% of the recommended bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: booster doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you add that bloom booster
to your plant feed, only put 50% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended dosage and see how the plants
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants don't show any sign of burn
or stunted growth, maybe increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding just a little bit next time and
increase it until you see the leaf tips
[SPEAKER_00]: just barely burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call it getting their nails done
because it starts to look like the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fingers are just getting their
fingernails on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them starting to get their
nails done, that's when you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing them to their limit and they're
just starting to get burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either give them that much again
and just keep burning them just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit or you can reduce it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do not go any harder with the bloom
booster once you see the fingernails start
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it sounds natural and feels natural to
want to add more bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you bigger fatter
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a point of diminishing
returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add too much, it will burn the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants begin to burn,
it will start to lock out nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they lock out nutrients, they will
not take any of your bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it all becomes a waste of money and
you have a shitty harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over bloom boost your plants five or
six weeks into flower and completely burn
[SPEAKER_00]: them and make them look like shit and ruin
your crop when you've only got three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are just the basic nutrients I
would recommend if you are growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every company is going to have other
products to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies may offer a silicate
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies may offer a terpene
enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies may recommend a bud
hardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what company you have chosen,
but be careful when adding your additives
[SPEAKER_00]: and just pay attention when mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your pH is correct and try
to make note of your EC or your PPMs if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're growing with organics,
if you're growing with super soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have probably mixed up your soil at
the beginning and there's not a lot you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do to it at this point other than
adding teas or maybe adding a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: or possibly a top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be quite honest with you, that is not
my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing organically and you
want to boost up your plants a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably suggest a compost tea
that included worm castings and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably include some sort of guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I am not the organic expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the no-till guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a super soil guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly grow in a commercial
environment and I grow from bottled and
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the advice and guidance that I
give you on this show will be based on
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled or powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that covers the basics of
nutrients for weeks four or five and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we want to give them a solid
NPK, a little bit of CalMag, some enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: some microbes, some carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would introduce kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would introduce a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically at this point, I would start
reducing the microbe products and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: start replacing the microbes with a bloom
booster product over the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I feel like we know what type of
environment to keep these plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we know how to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what's going on in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what can we do to these plants to
increase production?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to make sure they stay
healthy and pest free all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the flowering cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we need to keep in mind is that
we need to be very selective on sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: this late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer not to spray anything at
all on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do run into issues, there are
very limited options of products we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use to spray on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do our best at this point to keep
bugs out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should already be implementing an
integrated pest management system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes a spray rotation and
possible release of predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also avoid going to other gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have friends that grow,
I would stay away from their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also never take anybody else into
my grow, especially other friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are inviting their spider mites right
into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, change clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to another grow, if you work in
a commercial grow and have a private grow
[SPEAKER_00]: at home, change clothes between those
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend changing clothes
between stops at the grow store and going
[SPEAKER_00]: to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go straight from the hydro shop to
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are picking shit up at the grow store
all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the dirty growers are going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the soil is being shipped there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a hot bed for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take your pests from the grow store
right to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend a dedicated pair of
shoes for the garden or for the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in multiple facilities,
I would have a pair of shoes for the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have a pair of shoes that I wore
after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would have a different pair of
shoes that I put on to go in my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you have an outdoor grow and an
indoor grow, change clothes and shoes
[SPEAKER_00]: between those gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really tedious and it sounds
like overkill, but we do not want to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread spider mites from one garden to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most obvious and easy way for mites to
spread is for them to travel on a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do our best as responsible
growers, as responsible farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: to not spread spider mites to our other
grows and to our friends grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy to get rid of spider
mites early in flower and veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a pain in the ass to get rid of
spider mites late in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not drag them into the bloom
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have multiple rooms or multiple
facilities and you do find a pest issue in
[SPEAKER_00]: one area, treat that area as a
contaminated space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notify everybody that works there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there are spider mites in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in here unless it is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you do have to go in that area,
make sure you change clothes before
[SPEAKER_00]: entering another grow area and carrying
those spider mites throughout the facility
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one room that is not infested
with mites and you have another room that
[SPEAKER_00]: is infested with mites, work on the clean
room first when you get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all the work that needs to be done in
there, close that room up and be done,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go to that spider mite room,
do your work in there, and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done, leave the grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove your clothes, clean them,
put them in the laundry, and don't take
[SPEAKER_00]: those dirty clothes back into that clean
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on the clean room first, then work on
the dirty rooms last so that we don't drag
[SPEAKER_00]: those spider mites into the room that is
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know that one room is
contaminated and you have to go in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost suggest a lab coat or a
Tyvek suit that you can swap between
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to go into the mited room,
throw on the lab coat, throw on the Tyvek
[SPEAKER_00]: suit, go into the spider mited room,
do what you need to do, come out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: room, remove the lab coat or Tyvek suit,
replace it with a fresh lab coat or Tyvek
[SPEAKER_00]: suit, and then go into the room that you
need to work in next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I know this sounds tedious,
I know this sounds like overkill,
[SPEAKER_00]: but imagine if you've got 500 plants in
one room and you're expecting to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: over 100 pounds and we just dragged spider
mites into there from the other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got one room that is almost
ready to harvest and we've been fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites, it's almost gone,
we're almost through that battle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just walked into the other room and
we're five weeks into flower and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped a spider mite bomb in there
because you were lazy and didn't bother to
[SPEAKER_00]: change your lab coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small problems are small problems when
they are small problems, but when we go to
[SPEAKER_00]: a large scale cultivation facility,
a very small problem will multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those spider mites are going to have a
party when we turn off the lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody goes home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will come in the next morning and now
it is spider mite world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do our best to not introduce
spider mites to the grow because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: very limited on plans of attack to get rid
of those mites in this point of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very limited sprays we can
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we can do, we can release
predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you were planning ahead,
part of your integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: system did include ordering predator bugs
to be released early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully around week three you released
an army of predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if any spider mites do show up,
those predators are already colonized,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're already there claiming their turf
and no spider mites will start infesting
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you didn't get those predator bugs
in there early, it is not too late to
[SPEAKER_00]: order predators to come attack your spider
mite infestation, but you need to act
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say I'll order them Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see spider mites in the grow,
order those predator mites today.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that box of predator mites comes,
you need to stop what you were doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: release those bugs into the garden
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to win the war.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to release our troops to get in
there and destroy those spider mites that
[SPEAKER_00]: are sucking the juices out of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are destroying our potency and they
are diminishing our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get rid of them immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's too late to spray, I highly
suggest you order predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order more than you think you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a large army to get in there and
wipe out the infestation as quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier I did say we are very limited
on the products we can spray to our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: this late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few beneficial fungus based
products that can be applied to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: this late in flower that will not affect
the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand the products you are
using, you can apply a sprayed pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can release predators and they
will work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper pesticide at this stage of the
game will not harm your flowers and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will not kill your predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I do not suggest spraying plants
with bulky flowers, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: something has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a few spray application
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not spray anything oil based.
[SPEAKER_00]: This late in flower, it will ruin the
flavor and aroma of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things I would recommend to spray
this late in flower would be beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus type products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never apply an oil this late in
flower and I don't even want to spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: unless it is absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather release the predators and
let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand sometimes you're going to
go into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's more than what the
predators can handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may have already purchased a
pesticide and you don't have funding to
[SPEAKER_00]: order insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that things come up in a
garden and life does happen and we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: always control things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we can do from this situation is
take note.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try to understand how did we get
spider mites and how can we prevent this
[SPEAKER_00]: from happening next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to stop spraying the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also time to stop running the sulfur
burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a sulfur burner in your
grow, turn that shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is making your plants taste terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is making your concentrates taste
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop using sulfur burners in the
grow and let's start correcting the true
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is causing the powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: People use sulfur to prevent and cure
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we find the cause instead of
burning sulfur in the room and making the
[SPEAKER_00]: room smell like shit, making your buds
smell like shit, making your concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like shit, making the final product
completely taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out what's causing that powdery
mildew and cure that instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: burning sulfur in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know a lot of people have a sulfur
burner and that is their method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to stop doing it because
I said so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist on using a sulfur burner in
your garden, perhaps you can stop using it
[SPEAKER_00]: around week three or around week four when
those buds start popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in the episode I suggested
reducing humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps reducing that humidity a little
bit will help prevent that powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: since we're getting the fat buds,
we need to reduce humidity anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it a little cooler, reduce
humidity and stop burning that sulfur and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the product will taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever smoked a concentrate that
tasted like fish or fish oil, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: times that is because there was a sulfur
burner being used in the room during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more sprays and no more sulfur
burners after week three, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we are approaching week four,
it is time to reduce some of the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: stress we have been performing to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want to do some popping and
twisting and I still want to work them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the nets, but I don't want to go as
hard and as extreme as I was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to allow these plants to use their
energy on producing buds now and not
[SPEAKER_00]: recovering from all the popping and
breaking and not being stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to just focus on making fat
chunky buds and sweet trichomes for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to reduce the stress a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean I'm going to stop
beating them up, but I am going to mellow
[SPEAKER_00]: out just a little bit on these girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to reduce the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a little less popping
and twisting, but we are still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop and twist the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to continue working these
plants into the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a trellis net and you've got
a plant that's taken off, getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, don't be afraid to grab that one,
crack the stem and work it right back
[SPEAKER_00]: under the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: The start of week four is also a good time
to do our final bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got those little bud sets showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where the buds are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a stick with a bunch of
little tiny shitty buds on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just clean those little popcorn balls
right on off and leave that stuff at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the branch to develop into a nice
chunky bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I talked about
taking off all those little tiny sucker
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave the thick branches,
but those little buds that grow off the
[SPEAKER_00]: base of that branch toward the bottom,
those can get cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're just a waste of space and
energy and they're not going to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: anything except a pain in the ass,
you can cut those right off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers like to say, that's what I
was going to make concentrate out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to make my edibles
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to leave that there,
I feel like if you cut that stuff off,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't get a lot of light,
you take that energy and you move it right
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of the plant feeding those 12
little tiny shit buds at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can just put that energy right up at
the top where it's getting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can use that energy to make that top
cola that much beefier, that much fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sucks to trim that bottom stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to trim those little popcorn
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to waste time cutting that
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can cut something off to make
something better, why wouldn't you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to go do a final
bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean up that messy crap on the
bottom that's not going to turn into any
[SPEAKER_00]: usable bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also like to do a light defoliation
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf with a purple petiole will get
taken off at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a big leaf, it's got a
purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that long purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and break that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break that stem off as close to the
branch, as close to the bud as you can so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't leave that little stem there
with moisture hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just break that stem right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those leaves out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need all the excessive leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything with a purple stem,
I'll go kind of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do one layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say, yeah, I could do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll go back and take off more
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll stand back and look into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just try to make sure that I've
gotten all the giant leaves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking the light from hitting the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can see light coming down and it's
hitting a leaf and I can clearly see that
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf is hanging over a bud site,
I will remove that leaf so that bud site
[SPEAKER_00]: can get the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of old school growers are going
to tell you don't remove the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's where the nutrients and
sugars are stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pretty sure earlier in this
episode, we talked about feeding these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a whole bunch of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really a reason for these
plants to store nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are feeding the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are high performance plants that are
going to get a high performance meal every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need that stored stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves will give us opportunity for
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are places for pests to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves have to come off when we trim
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take those leaves off now and save us the
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't go extreme and make the plants
naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off the leaves with the giant
petioles and the leaves that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of intimidating for new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, this is an art and a skill
that you will have to develop over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way to practice defoliating and
seeing what happens to the plants is to
[SPEAKER_00]: get four plants of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got four clones of let's say
Golden Go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got four Golden Go plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate one really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate one kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate one a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then don't defoliate the other one at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take pictures if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take as many notes as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep an eye on those notes and
pictures and see which plant came out the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the plant that you left alone come out
the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the plant that we beat to shit and
almost made it naked come out the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it the one that's right in the
middle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be strain specific on how
hard you want to go with defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most strains will benefit from a
medium defoliation and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely benefit from removing all those
super large leaves that are blocking your
[SPEAKER_00]: bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you go too hard, your plants will
look naked and the growth will stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go extremely hard on your first
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and pull off some leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say this in the podcast all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take more off, but you can never
glue those leaves back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull a few off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take off more, get in there
and take them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're intimidated by it, leave the
leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will suggest is that if a leaf
is yellow or funky, you remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hesitate and don't be shy to take
down the ugly leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow leaves are invitations for
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spider mite will see a yellow leaf and
they will head right to that leaf because
[SPEAKER_00]: it is weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outer layer isn't as thick and crunchy
so that spider mite can get its shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: little fangs right through that skin and
it can get right in there and start
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to deal with that thick,
healthy plant flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of those yellow leaves and
remove them from the garden as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I would suggest at this
point in flowering is to increase airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a good time to add some fans to
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have an oscillating fan in
the room, now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those leaves rustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want those buds sitting still and
letting stagnant air build up in those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't want the plants being bent
over and getting shit whipped by the fan
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want every leaf to rustle
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want that fan to pass by and just
give those leaves just a little rustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stir the air just so that nothing can
get still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep doing this motion with my hand
like you guys can see me just moving that
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said earlier, our buds are
going to start developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start getting fat and
chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds work like sponges.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too much moisture in the air,
that moisture will get trapped inside
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll start getting bud mold inside
the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a fan, moving that air and
moisture around, that will reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for bud mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're adding fans, you may need
to add some sticks or some sort of cages
[SPEAKER_00]: for supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using a trellis net,
your buds are going to start toppling
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not wait till weeks five and six
when those buds are big and chunky and
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky and they're falling over trying to
break the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some steaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start supporting these plants early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big long branch and you
can tell that it's going to turn into a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant bud, go ahead and stick a long steak
into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to cut up too many of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shove that steak straight into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that stick straight up, sticking where
you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use a twisty tie or a zip tie or
something gentle to just gently attach
[SPEAKER_00]: that topply stick to that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to squeeze that branch at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be loose so that you don't
pinch that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some freedom in there,
but you don't want it flopping around too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pinch or crush or squeeze the branch
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a few steaks and stick them in the
dirt and have them sticking straight up
[SPEAKER_00]: and attach those floppy branches to those
steaks as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use a shit ton of steaks
in each pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you've got to do,
that's what you've got to do to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some sticks or get some tomato cages
and be prepared to start supporting your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your buds get so chunky that those
plants just want to fall right over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I hope for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also hope you've got some sticks or
a tomato cage on hand so that those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't die when that shit starts happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some sticks on our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to focus on is to
continue scouting for pests and PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we're this late in flower
doesn't mean that problems can't arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eyes open for pests and powdery
mildew and boy tritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while we're scouting for pests and boy
tritis, we also need to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any nutrient burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any pH issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few crunchy leaves here and there,
that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few shitty leaves low in the canopy,
that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start getting large clusters of
shitty looking leaves, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that needs to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you were taking notes of what
you've been feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got some kind of record
of what the pH was that was going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and maybe you've even been taking
notes of what is coming out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been measuring the EC and pH of
your runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, that will help you diagnose
problems if a problem should arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while you're scouting for pests and
while you're looking for nutrient issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: also don't forget about all of the
equipment in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do some visual inspections while
you're walking through the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, look, you may notice things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be paying attention to the plants
and the equipment while you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while you're looking around,
you're looking around for equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, you're looking around for pests,
and we're also looking around for yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, we still need to keep our eyes out
for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing from seed, it is still
an opportunity to reveal hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: traits this far into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your eyes out for herm flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've talked a little bit in a
previous episode about what to do if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do discover a hermaphroditic plant this
late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got several options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull out the flowers, you can cut
off the main bud that's got the male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers on it, you can cut down the whole
plant, or you can choose to ignore the
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate threat and you can keep an eye
on that male flower and see if it opens
[SPEAKER_00]: and drops pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind that if you do see male
flowers, you do run the risk of having
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point of flowering,
those female plants are really eager to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive that pollen and create seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your eye open because it is not
too late to find hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that is always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eyes open through the entire
grow on your first or second run with the
[SPEAKER_00]: new cultivar or if you're growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is starting to get long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start recapping and start
wrapping up the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week four, we are going to continue
working the plants into the nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to bottom the plants a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is the time to put on sticks or
tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to reduce the stress of the plants
and start letting the buds develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still need to work the plants and
pop the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And defoliate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll work into week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we're going to do our final
bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to finish bottoming the plants by
the end of week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do our final popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to let the plants just
settle in and develop buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do our final major defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to lightly defoliate
through harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the last big defoliation we
will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also pull all of the shitty
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take off all the small popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any branches that don't look like they're
worth the shit will get taken out at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the last chance to get supports on
these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have some sticks or some
tomato cages in there now, by week five,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to see problems in week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to start toppling
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is the time to get in there and
make sure you've got sticks and some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of twisty tie or something like that
holding your buds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also time to increase airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to start getting chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have the airflow moving,
now is the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need a carbon filter in week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to recap that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in week six, we are going to need that
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better have those sticks and supports
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are done bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are done working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are done cracking, popping,
and twisting these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to let them grow and let the
buds get fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay on top of scouting for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to pay attention to
environmental, nutrient, or pH stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we see anything caused by those
things, we need to adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my favorite part about weeks five and
six, this is when the good photos happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are starting to get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are nice and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the pistols are still nice and
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the leaves are still lush and
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a great time to start taking
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my favorite part of week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in week four, you got little nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got those little popcorn balls
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in week five, you're starting to get
actual buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the buds growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in week six, you actually start
developing photogenic colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get in there and start taking
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing some beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to get some good colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week six is when it really starts getting
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing to think about is keeping
these plants healthy, pest-free,
[SPEAKER_00]: problem-free, all the way till the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start posting photos just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do take a sweet-ass photo in week
six, I suggest you start saving it until
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start flooding the pictures out after
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, nobody knows when you're cutting
down your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of a weed grower trick
from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to start thinking about is,
is the next run ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to harvest these plants in
two to four weeks, depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have plants lined up for the next
run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have clones that are getting
rooted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ordered seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared for the next run?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to miss any time,
so let's get on top of the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels like a great opportunity to
pitch my seed vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some seeds, I highly recommend
the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find them at www.dankseed.store.
