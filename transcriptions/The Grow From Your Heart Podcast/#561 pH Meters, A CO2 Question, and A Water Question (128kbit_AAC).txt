[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dads of hella tight live
batter from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of sex on the beach and
peach warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
sour and star fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something sour and funky about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I've ever tasted star
fruit, so I can't compare that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it tasted like sweet mangoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a star fruit tastes like a sugary
mango, that is an accurate description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show this to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the remnants of my gram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked the better part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was pretty delicious, quite potent on
the back of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it contains 60.0 or 60.15% THC and
non detectable amounts of CVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at green dot
labs for the delicious hella tight live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, I'm going to

[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already supporting the show
on Patreon and you'd like to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do so, all you have to do is visit www
.patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include that link in
the show notes to make it nice and easy
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think we have covered all of
the business part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you've got a question,
you can send it to me via Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a level on Patreon that you will
get your question right to the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Patreon question came from the
girls grow to and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff, can you give me any
advice on pH meters and EC meters?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheap shit on Amazon sucks,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it's hard to find really solid
information on equipment that isn't total
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any advice or $150 meters
worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, unfortunately, you get what you pay
for when it comes to EC meters and pH pens
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the good shit is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is scientific equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most cases, when it comes to
scientific equipment, the more expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not probably what you wanted
to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted me to recommend some sort of
$40 device that will save the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have that
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to screen share some stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were watching the video,
this is exactly the device that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing a Blue Lab pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Blue Lab pH pen for $100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's another combo meter that is
$308.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will measure pH and conductivity
and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conductivity is the EC, the electrical
conductivity that measures the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the device I use, the Blue Lab
combo meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is $308.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy that, I also recommend you
buy the storage solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also recommend you buy one or two
bottles of calibration solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need a four and a seven and
possibly a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your research before you buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the appropriate calibration solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a little tiny bit,
but not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to calibrate about once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're on a tight budget,
you don't need that EC meter and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend this Blue Lab pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to step it up,
go for the Blue Lab combo meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they do offer in the middle
here, you see the Blue Lab truncheon
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, it says impossibly tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: EC meter built to last a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the Blue Lab stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are relying on these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like, if you were a carpenter,
this is your saw or your hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use this every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want this right there on your tool
belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you spend good quality money on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cheap out on this type of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that, like I said,
you're using it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants rely on you to have the
appropriate pH and EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered you on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper storage is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do get a good pH pen,
make sure it is stored properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a storage solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommend you store your pH meter in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some in the cap and then push the
meter right into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll leave some of that moisture in the
cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never want it to get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase is, if it dries, it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never let your meters get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also clean them and calibrate them
obsessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep saying, don't cheap out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing kind of an expensive
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about the value of the
product in the end, you've got a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: or 300 bucks to spend on this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least you will after a couple of
harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you'll save that much on your
dispensary runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about returning investment into your
garden so your garden is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do got to buy the expensive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that I had cheaper news for you,
but it's expensive to get good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says, side note, I've also listened
to some of your episodes more than once
[SPEAKER_00]: and sending them off to friends now who
are wanting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, and it's thanks to you,
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate knowing that you're
introducing new people to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means you trust me enough to tell your
other girl friends like, Hey, listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's teaching me how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can teach you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got a virtual fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say you're a solid human
with a good, big heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a good energy that can be felt
through the mic and through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my favorite grow podcast by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My man from girls grow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you could feel the vibes and
energy coming through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people feel plasticky and weird
on shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you meet them,
they're not who you met through the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all I know how to be as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you're noticing and thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks again for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thank you for the continued
Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name pop up on Patreon every
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the iry army forever gang gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting a big check mark on your
message there because I've done read that
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had cheaper advice for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could recommend a cheap piece of
gear, but cheap gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why cheap out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get cheap shit, just like musical
instruments, just like most stuff in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy the cheap shit if you want,
but it's cheap shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to buy it once, go buy a good
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they say the cheap hammer is the
most expensive tool you'll ever buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got to buy six hammers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to break it every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go buy a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that bought the $40 hammer on
Monday, he didn't break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spent 10 bucks, five days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought five hammers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spent 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cheaped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't win.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next message comes from North North
Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up North?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard your name on the DGC also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for supporting the cannabis
community and cannabis podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that the dude and everybody,
Scotty real, everybody at the dude grow
[SPEAKER_00]: show appreciates your support for the
community as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I printed this message,
it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it printed the Patreon box and it
printed your name, but it didn't print the
[SPEAKER_00]: full question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that you did ask, you said you
wanted to breed with Scarlett,
[SPEAKER_00]: but going is, is there a specific
phenotype of Scarlett begonias,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I would recommend for breeding with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes, there is a, a big bushy phenotype
that's very, uh, fast growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a bushy tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's fast growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit longer to finish
than most of the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a longer finishing phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's probably not your favorite
thing to hear when it comes to breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants the fast finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like longer flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think longer flowering times gives you
bigger plants, more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: More vigor, uh, the longer flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like their high better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give me a better head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I breed toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it were me, I would find the one
that grows like a big tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long finisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got long skinny jacket leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a haze plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant makes long, tall colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant is just long, tall colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also the trichomes are really,
um, they're not, some plants make short
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trichomes are really tall as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stick up off the plants quite far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scope them, you'd be like,
those are tall trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also this one, the phenotype I'm talking
about, if you've grown it a few times,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll notice that at the end of the
flowering phase, no matter what you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just goes hard yellow on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, you could feed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow your feed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can top dress me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want, but yellow,
I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the plant that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very haze dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of the haze from the
redheaded stranger cross in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a lot of golden goat coming
through in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the Island sweet skunk,
but it's got a really sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, leaf shape, and a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is noticeable is it is very
spicy in flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a, a spicy sour apple
sucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a sour apple sucker and maybe
dunked it in jalapeno juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds really weird,
but you're going to, if you go get a sour
[SPEAKER_00]: apple sucker, you'll notice there's a
spiciness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost sour apples with a jalapeno
juice on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you so, it gets me so high that
I'm almost, I sit still, but I'm super
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cause my brain is jogging,
running laps around me, but my body is so
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned that I can't, there's no need to
move anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the phenotype I would recommend
breed to her and you will get that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put, I think you were going to breed
it to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what your goal to breed it to
was because I didn't print the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's poor podcasting, but breed it to
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will find that you get an insane,
insane, head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make your eyes vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your body vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, your brain will be running
laps inside your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish, the little fish in your fish
bowl will be swimming laps, bumping into
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall and shit, but your body will just
be stuck and he won't want to do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: except sit there and try to contemplate
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pick the lint out of your belly
button or something that's as exciting as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the female phenotype that I
would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a male phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to breed with a male,
don't get the one that is crazy tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crazy tall, tall male is just going to
make crazy tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get even taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The offspring outgrow the tall scarlet
begonias male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use the male,
find one that's medium in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a super tall one because it
puts off tall traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the one that's got sour apples
and puke and the stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use the male,
that's as far as I can give you advice on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got so many phenotypes to pick
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: However many seeds you've got,
you got a couple of males to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the earliest male to show
you that it's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be too dominant in the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got five males, usually that
second, third and fourth one are the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, too dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, kind of weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three in the middle are your
selectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then base that on vigor, leaf shape,
plant shape, aroma, stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one of them get powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does one of them have spider mites and the
other one doesn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the one that doesn't have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's showing you that it's got
resistance and we want to pass on
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're not just breeding for
Instagram hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got some ... I know who
you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got a good goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just speaking in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with intention, breed with purpose,
and I think you'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck with your scarlet begonias
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'd love a 10 pack of those seeds,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably grow those out and send you
some gnarly photos of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe back cross it, maybe F to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what a breeder like me
would do with some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my good friend,
North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name pop up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the love and
support that you showed to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community and to cannabis podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need people like you on our side,
on our team, keeping us going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big virtual digital fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit doing that because it fucks up
the light every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from ... Do they want their
name said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a Y and a P, a V.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, Hey man, thanks for entertaining
us, educating us, and providing us with
[SPEAKER_00]: dank ass genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing my passions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to come on here and be a wise
ass and be goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education was what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to dispel all the silly myths
around cannabis and then providing you
[SPEAKER_00]: with dank ass genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've said this before,
without somebody on the other end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, I'm just a psychopath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says between all the breeding,
live chats, podcasts, and consulting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to be the busiest guy in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I do take breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I decide that it is time to take a
break, there's a day or three where we
[SPEAKER_00]: just chill out and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for noticing that I'm
staying busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's daily work, taking care of the
plants is daily work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live chats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a live chat every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on embracing organics every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then today was a Saturday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the operation grow show at two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a cannabis live panel where I talked
about breeding at three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's late in the evening and I'm
doing my own show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do stay pretty busy with live chats
and podcasting and then consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a once or twice a week thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm out of town for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some miles on the car, put a lot of
miles on my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing, but it says,
I appreciate all of your time and effort
[SPEAKER_00]: and the quality you bring to everything
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make sure that everything I do is at
least a solid nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to make it a 10, but you know,
we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fucking humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times I try to make
everything fucking solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I've got a question
regarding CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a CO2 grow or I ran CO2 last grow
and pulled significantly more weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've got nothing to compare to it
since it was the first time I ran those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good that you realized
there's not a valid test in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would have jumped to the
conclusion that it was the CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you've got new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe those are hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they came from seed and they had
seed vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having thought on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I also ran at 800 PPM
because I was not confident I would be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to keep the plants up with 1600 PPM
of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of CO2 to try to maintain
for eight or nine weeks of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you want to add veg in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did increase CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did augment it a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural CO2 is probably somewhere between
four and 450 PPMs of CO2, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were increasing and giving those
plants a little extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says, my question is, in your
experience, what does elevated CO2 bring
[SPEAKER_00]: to the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is another expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing you're going to
notice because before you see any return
[SPEAKER_00]: on your investment, you are paying out of
pocket for equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a CO2, either a generator or a
tank and a regulator, and then you need
[SPEAKER_00]: tubing and you need a monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you're going to notice
that it brings to the grow is another
[SPEAKER_00]: expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you'll notice is it brings
another trip to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to refill that CO2 canister
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to drag that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the tall ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the short ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get them out of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's at your house, that could be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that comes with CO2
is more equipment and another expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's talk about the return on
your investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes with the CO2 is more vigor,
more size, more growth, possibly a week
[SPEAKER_00]: less veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running CO2 and veg,
they're going to get that much larger,
[SPEAKER_00]: that much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be able to cut down your veg
time by a whole entire week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you're going to see is a
faster metabolism, which means you can
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the plants more, which means they eat
more, which means they grow bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: faster, which hopefully means you're
getting bigger, better buds at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall thing that you're going to
see with CO2, if you do it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a bigger harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have bigger fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have more vigorous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have healthier plants that
eat more, and they're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a little bit higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to take stress a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, you're going to get
big, fat, juicy, more potent buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about more potent,
but bigger and fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse the more potent part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried to sound like a salesman,
over-talked myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it goes on to say, are both quality
and quantity increased?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some best practices regarding
feeding temperature and light levels when
[SPEAKER_00]: running moderate to high levels of CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantity will be increased if you do it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot guarantee that quality will be
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing that will
turbocharge the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may push them to the next level,
but it may not increase potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it will increase the size of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have more of it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't guarantee an increase in
quality, but I can almost promise an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what are some of the best
practices regarding feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to keep an eye on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best practices is always keep an eye on
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants be the fucking boss,
but you may be able to increase feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: because now they're metabolizing a little
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave them a little bit of a
turbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they could take more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a turbocharger on the engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they could take more gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could burn more rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might want to eat just a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making them work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're exercising them more,
feed them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding temperature, you may be able to
get them a little bit more warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to promise, but now they may
tolerate a little bit higher temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: with more CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light levels, always run the most light
you can put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go ridiculous, but always try to
have the most lights you can put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that you're not running
ridiculous amounts of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would know about that by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have included that in your
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a thousand watt light,
turn it up to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got LEDs, crank them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say run that light as high as you
can for your space and for your allowance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing, but more light,
more light, and then more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then moderate to high levels of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you consider moderate to high
levels of CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 is a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get up to 1600.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good range to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that the higher you go,
the more they may eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may start speeding up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to mention is once you
start feeding them a high level of CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said before, you weren't
confident you can keep it at 1600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to a level you're confident in which
you can keep it, and then don't back off
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run your CO2 during the lights,
but not during the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need CO2 during the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting out their own CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a veg area, pump that air
from the veg area into your flower area
[SPEAKER_00]: while it's sleeping, and you'll move that
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lights are on in your flower area,
they can take advantage of that CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: but run the CO2 during the light cycle,
not during the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is smart venting.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is heavier than oxygen, so it's going
to fall to the bottom, but if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: big carbon filter and you've got a bunch
of air moving and you're exhausting the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and getting heat out of the room,
getting humidity out, you may also be
[SPEAKER_00]: venting out your CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your venting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where the CO2 is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I've seen guys do it a
couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some dry ice and a bucket of
water, and you put that in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see where the air goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry ice will make smoke, and you can
see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're me, take a fat dab in the
room and let it out real slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't blow it because it'll go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let your dab out just out of your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where the air flows into your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the shit getting sucked right out of
the vent?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some opportunity for airflow in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust some fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where the air is flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is slightly heavier than oxygen,
so it will fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a fan blowing it back up if you want
it to come back up to canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a fan facing up will deter insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs want to land on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a fan going up, they can't
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get annoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find somewhere else to fucking land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got CO2, think about your
exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the main things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've started giving it CO2,
don't stop giving it CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be something about dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just a shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have the ability to dial in my
environment perfectly, and I also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR meter to adjust my lighting and can
maintain over 1,000 PPFD evenly if needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if they start acting like they're
angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them as much light as you think
they'll take, and then pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start drooping, if they start
curling, if they show you they're angry,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of room do you have that you can
dial in perfectly and get 1,000 PPFD
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, good job building that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants decide if they're getting
enough light or too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now, you should be able to tell what
they're looking like when they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, thank you for
everything you do and may the only corona
[SPEAKER_00]: in your life have a lime in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great fucking catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not drink, but I will have a kombucha
with the lime in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some tea over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll drop a lime in that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he sent me a link to some music,
a local Detroit rapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully he puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend, Stone Trout
Bum for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your CO2 questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a smart guy, so you should
be able to make use of the info I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a question,
of course, patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart, or this one came from
grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read one more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll be enough for this
episode, trying to get these pages unstuck
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've got concentrates on the table
and now everything is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard this story before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Ross, to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says his Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go by green thumb Kels on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys give green thumb Kels a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just want to know your rec for
a water schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one res, one pump and two tents on
a 12 hour schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: One at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to water all of my plants at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I set watering for both to get
maximum efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and grow on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be listening as I always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has access to their grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like our friend has one
opportunity per day to water, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: running two tents on opposite cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done this in one room before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a room that fits two five by five
tents perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spare bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot upgrade the electricity in there,
so I can't run both tents at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gets too hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've decided to run one from 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other runs from 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a light on in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using that electricity to its maximum
efficiency while not blowing anything out
[SPEAKER_00]: and having to do any upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lasted a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should go back to doing that one day,
but it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel your pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got one opportunity to get in there
and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't disrupt the dark cycle of the
tent that's asleep, but we've got to water
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent that's awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in there doing it, I would say
the time to do it is 6.45 to 7.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're in there 15 minutes before
one goes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right as the light goes off, you zip your
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night, sweet dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would rather water in the morning right
at the start of the day, but we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tent gets watered right before
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if this works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're watering yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you've got a pump and a rez,
so you might be doing auto-watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get in there 15 minutes before
that first light went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself 15 minutes to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be long enough to water a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit them with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out whatever needs to be done in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights will go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other tent comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water that bad bitch in 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip them up and get them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should take you about 30 minutes to
water both of those tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more time, extend your time
both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're in there when the flip
happens and you're not disrupting any
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is ideal to water right at
the lights on time, right at sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives the plants all day to
metabolize those nutrients you gave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they can rest and sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Babies do their growing when they're
sleeping, but you don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you can't get in there and water
yourself, if you're using a pump and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using an auto system and a
reservoir, why can't we set two timers and
[SPEAKER_00]: have them water at two different times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have a splitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got to water it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's on one splitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's all on one watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, water whenever is best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water when one comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe in the middle of one night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way one's in the middle of the day
and one's in the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adjust to what
works for your life right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I keep saying it, it's best to
water when the lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your best bet is to water right in
the middle of one hour cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got seven to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in the middle there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: One o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water at 1 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way one is sleeping and it's only got
six hours till the lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't spend too much time super wet in
the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the other one's still got six
hours to metabolize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still got some water for the dark
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be okay at any time of the
day that you do it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were looking for a more
specific piece of advice, but without
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing if you're the one watering them by
hand or if you've got a system to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're doing it by hand,
get in there 15, 20 minutes before one
[SPEAKER_00]: goes off, water it, close it up,
open up the next one, do it, get the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: out for the day, call it a done deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a machine doing it, any time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to be one of them is going
to get watered at a dark cycle at an
[SPEAKER_00]: inopportune time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Green Thumb
Kells from Instagram.
