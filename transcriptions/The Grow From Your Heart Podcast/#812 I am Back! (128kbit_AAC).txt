here at the start of the show I do have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of great messages to read here on
today's podcast I did mention that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give away free seeds on today's
show if you go to my website I read
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics comm there is a tab on the top
that says grow help if you click on that
[SPEAKER_01]: grow help tab and send me a great question
if I read your question here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Podcast I will send you a free pack of iri
genetics premium seeds This question of
[SPEAKER_01]: course came from the grow help tab This
one came from a person who wants to be
[SPEAKER_01]: known as michigan mike big up to michigan
mike great to meet you Thank you for the
[SPEAKER_01]: great question mike, please do send me
your shipping address The question goes a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says hello rasta jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you, bro It says I am a
grower here in the great lake state I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been growing outside for about three years
now in this short Season that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet that's a struggle, bro It goes on it
says i'm growing in fabric pots But the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem is that the pots get really nasty
on the outside from year to year Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: i've seen that like a white crusty buildup
that'll grow on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's from the salty nutrients I'm
not sure what you're using to grow but
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes i'll get algae on there And of
course if you're growing outside you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get dirt and mud and all kinds of
junk and gunk built up on the outsides I
[SPEAKER_01]: completely understand bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're playing with dirt and organic stuff
and nutrients And all kinds of shit here
[SPEAKER_01]: anything could go wrong anything is
possible But it does say is there a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean these pots year after year after the
growing season ends Or should I buy new
[SPEAKER_01]: pots each and every year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to reuse them each year if
possible That's probably the most
[SPEAKER_01]: cost-effective most eco-friendly way We
don't need to throw away a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: if we can clean it and reuse it It goes on
it says also, uh that we've got a second
[SPEAKER_01]: question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me talk about the first question then
we will jump up to The second question the
[SPEAKER_01]: first one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know how big your pots are I'm
not sure if you're using I grow indoors I
[SPEAKER_01]: use a three a five maybe a seven gallon
pot indoors Those aren't too much to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you could be using a 30 or even a
hundred maybe even a 250 gallon fabric pot
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what you've got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of Suggestions that work
for me that maybe you can modify for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what I would do If it were me and
they were small pots I would take them to
[SPEAKER_01]: the laundry mat and Throw them in the
washer throw them in the big commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: washer if they've got it don't Unless
you're brave don't do this in your washer
[SPEAKER_01]: at home Where your lady is going to come
home if your wife or girlfriend or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even your mama or even worse Your baby
mama is going to show up and find that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a bunch of pots from the garden
in the washing machine Maybe don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take them to the laundry mat and wash them
in there So they're not in your your
[SPEAKER_01]: lady's washer where she's going to throw a
fit and then also rinse out run that
[SPEAKER_01]: washing machine after one time when you're
done at the laundry mat to get all your
[SPEAKER_01]: gunk out of There for the next person but
my first option my first suggestion is
[SPEAKER_01]: take them to the laundry mat throw them in
the washer Give them a good solid hot
[SPEAKER_01]: water rinse if you want to throw some
organic detergent in there of your choice
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I would put any sort of
detergent in there Just give them a good
[SPEAKER_01]: jostle in that washer You can even throw
them in the dryer when you're done if you
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to that's my first idea Idea
number two throw them in the back of the
[SPEAKER_01]: truck if they're big and take them to the
car wash Go use that car wash sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put any soap in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pay for the the power hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it the car wash Just use that just
spray them down with that put them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: they got the thing You can hold your car
mats the floor mats clip them into there
[SPEAKER_01]: spray the shit out of it Let it hang for a
few minutes throw that one on the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bring somebody with you and make
them carry that one over and fucking shop
[SPEAKER_01]: vac it out If they can do that for you
give you a little backup, maybe even shop
[SPEAKER_01]: vac it out first Then hang the next one up
spray the shit out of it Let them let them
[SPEAKER_01]: dry in the Sun after that or put them in
the back of the truck and drive around
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll probably dry that way put
something heavy on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't lose any my next Idea,
of course, I'm just coming up with shit to
[SPEAKER_01]: help you because I would use the the
washing machine at the laundry mat Is what
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do or the car wash The other idea
maybe you got a big farm Maybe you have
[SPEAKER_01]: your own space hit them with the pressure
washer, bro Lay them out in the driveway
[SPEAKER_01]: lay them out in the Sun or out somewhere
and just hit them Wow, you guys that was
[SPEAKER_01]: lightning Thunder so loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it through the headphones through
all the noise canceling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize I'm not even gonna cut that
part out of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were getting beat with hail and Crazy
storms all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was wild freaking lightning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for the shock and distraction
That's real life big shout out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor growers in Colorado this year You
guys are working guys and gals are working
[SPEAKER_01]: for your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back on track Power wash your
pots if you're out in the yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you got a big driveway, maybe an open
space, maybe go to a parking lot I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you can do But get the power
washer out there and just power wash the
[SPEAKER_01]: shit out of those pots Those are three
solid ideas that I think would work for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got a washing machine Or a
laundry mat near them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people have a car wash near them and
some people They live near a harbor
[SPEAKER_01]: freight probably have a power washer or
know somebody with a pressure washer And
[SPEAKER_01]: they love to use those things your friends
with pressure washers love to just fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: blast stuff with them So they'll want to
do it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my dude, Michigan Mike Those are the
first three recommendations for part one
[SPEAKER_01]: of your question Part two of the question
is a really good question that I get asked
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the time So let's jump into part
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says also are you Ever going to make
auto flower seeds sometime in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to that is a strong No,
I do not make auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not interested excited nor passionate
about passionate about auto flower seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I would not do a good job
making auto flower seeds There are plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of people out there making amazing auto
flower genetics that are readily available
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mentioned in the past that my
friend das from night owl and I were kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of collabing and working on an Auto flower
project with a half his stuff half mine
[SPEAKER_01]: The f1 generation has been made and no
blame no finger pointing at anybody We
[SPEAKER_01]: both kind of pushed it to the back burner
and have been working on other shit
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither one of us have put any energy into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not blaming anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both busy dudes with Seed companies
and wives to live but that project it
[SPEAKER_01]: exists, but it has not moved forward in
any way I'm not super involved in the auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower project because like I said,
it is not my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like photo period plants Eventually Daz
and night owl genetics will put out some
[SPEAKER_01]: iry crosses that have some auto flower
that are auto flowers that have iry in
[SPEAKER_01]: there also my buddy I can loco are making
auto flowers out of some of my stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know if they'll ever release it but
If you do want the auto stay tuned and
[SPEAKER_01]: check out Daz from night owl because
eventually one day He will release auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers that do have iry genetics in the
lineage, but not straight-up iry genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I'm just not into auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I describe it as I play music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could play any kind of music You need
played if the band if a band called and
[SPEAKER_01]: said hey, bro our drummer I don't want to
give a drummer a problem But if he
[SPEAKER_01]: disappeared if you got abducted by aliens
because that's rare and cool If you got
[SPEAKER_01]: abducted by aliens, we'd talk a lot about
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool So if you got abducted by
aliens and they said we need a drummer I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like I could probably fill in for
most basic gigs You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean not like some I probably shouldn't
try to fill in for Dream Theater or
[SPEAKER_01]: Meshuggah or some shit But most basic shit
I could do it, but I don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: passion to play in a country Band,
you know that just doesn't do it for me
[SPEAKER_01]: reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotcha jamrock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotcha rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it country music I could do it
because it needs to be done But it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be it's not gonna feel like real
country because I don't have a real
[SPEAKER_01]: country music feel My auto flowers would
just be me playing country It just be
[SPEAKER_01]: really just doing it for a paycheck and
I'm not into that grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: breed with love That's the way that I do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting rambly and nostalgic today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go on It wraps up with thank you
for the great podcast And for giving me so
[SPEAKER_01]: much information and for the ideas that
help me grow, bro Thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_01]: compliments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the interaction Thank you
for being part of the iry army.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says keep up the great job that you
guys are doing bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big respect Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, my buddy, Michigan Mike,
please do send me your shipping address
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a real name on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan Mike isn't gonna fly for me put a
real name on there because the lady at the
[SPEAKER_01]: post office She wears a mask down
underneath Her nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just wears it over her mouth But she
always gives me a snide look when the
[SPEAKER_01]: names are like Michigan Mike or like Big
Mike smokes weed or Dabaholic 5000 she
[SPEAKER_01]: does notice that stuff and I don't want
any Problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep the momentum moving here on
today's podcast I've got another great
[SPEAKER_01]: question here in front of me This one also
did come from the grow help tab on the iry
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics website This one came from
somebody who we are going to call crystal
[SPEAKER_01]: today crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says hello Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I just wanted to say thank you
very much for bringing quality genetics at
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable prices Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna ramble here for a minute I think
that seeds are overpriced on a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: websites and a lot of places by a lot of
breeders a lot of what was making seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive back in the day was the idea of
scarcity because the idea of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization the illegal ization of seeds
now cannabis is legal in a lot of places
[SPEAKER_01]: We can produce our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to worry about so many
things without all that fear and without
[SPEAKER_01]: the the legal Without the justice system
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that this product should be
so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price of cannabis has gone down The
cost of living has gone up people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily Need ganja seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a secondary and ancillary
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a bonus you buy food You get
all the groceries you get the baby taken
[SPEAKER_01]: care of you get the family taken care of
the car the phone all that stuff Maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: buy some Some extra good groceries or
something, but the the seeds are like at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of the list of shit that you've
got to buy So I try to keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to charge a whole bunch of
money for seeds that I can make I've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of them I want to get them out there
I'd rather get the seeds out there and get
[SPEAKER_01]: them grown and make a few bucks Then have
a bunch of seeds in a box and make a
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make any sense to me I told
you I was gonna ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing that my seeds are
affordable I want everybody to have access
[SPEAKER_01]: to high quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems very reasonable And very fair
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see no reason to charge exorbitant
prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let me move forward it says um
Being a medical patient it has really
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me in many ways and I am very
grateful So they're talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off as a Medical marijuana
patient myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off as a pot smoker became a
medical marijuana patient Then I became
[SPEAKER_01]: the manager at the only medical marijuana
dispensary in my city So I got to see a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people's need for cannabis They're
medical their recreational need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it improve the quality of people's
lives So I do have a lot of appreciation
[SPEAKER_01]: for getting these seeds out to medical
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing once again All
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be a challenge today Why do
they call dabs concentrates when all you
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot do is concentrate after you smoke I
could do anything but concentrate right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get back into it It says is there
any way to know when certain varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: will be back in stock on I redirect as I
was told by a good friend Of mine that
[SPEAKER_01]: your strain the machine would be a great
one to help me and my nerve pain issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I deal with Thank you once again for
