[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 451 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me is my
buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, as always,
this episode is brought to you by our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new, regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds for your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I just took some ridiculous dabs
of some pre-98 Bubba Kush batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it has 61% THC and 72.2% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sets you back in the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you nice and mellow, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a pretty chill evening
since we broke that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super chill pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I let Mike smell it,
he said, oh, that smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the earthy gassy,
funky sort of a smell that comes out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a solid Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that batter is just so pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that golden color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice kind of a cheesecake-y texture to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really liking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious pre-98
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Kush batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been killing it over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knocked it out of the freaking park.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I are going to read some customer
reviews in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I would like to give
a shout out to some of our friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to my buddy,
Brett G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big giant grow from your
heart podcast shout out to my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to Keith K.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a giant shout out to Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant grow from your
heart podcast shout out to my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby McStabwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a giant fist bump to my
buddy, Matthew K.
[SPEAKER_00]: W.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information that you need will

[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all the technical business
we've got to take care of here at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you been, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Been good, man, yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I am great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics has taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is getting a lot of listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have nothing to complain about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful and thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to be a guest on the Dude Grows
podcast with Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Scotty?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Scotty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of great response to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My YouTube boosted up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of podcast listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually reposted the episode on this
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe hopefully many of our friends
listen to that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun watching the community sort of
blur together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really I like mixing the Dude Grows crew
and the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like blending them into one big cannabis
force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said on Scotty's show that I don't feel
any sort of competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for one of us to feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, Jeff, you've got the best
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to have the best, but I feel no
sort of competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't out to be better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out to do my duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love uniting the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty's team, my team, the Dude's team,
my team, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango Lose's team from Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on the same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to grow the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel no no competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love uniting everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loving that that sort of feel of the
cannabis community right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, it was like, this is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like either you're one of my
supporters, you're one of my haters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you support that guy, you're just a
hater for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of that's fallen away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noted now that we've got so many more
states coming on, I have noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new states like you've got to go
in and flex and be like, no, we're bad
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of those people either
survive or disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone through enough of those phases
here in Colorado to where we know the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are doing it, who have survived
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at each other and we go,
bro, you made the struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we high five each other and we just
keep going because we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's been so rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the other that you see from
time to time where it's, you're still
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there is some of that,
but a lot of that weeds itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does absolutely remove itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market cleans itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most industries do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it takes a while for the course
correction to happen, but it usually
[SPEAKER_01]: comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about that a lot on the show
because this is grow from your heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: not drum from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was in the music industry and it's
the same shit in the music industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same nepotism, the same favoritism,
the same bickering, the same infighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing, just different
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shifts a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same reality show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same soap opera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it with so many artists that I
love when their first couple albums that
[SPEAKER_01]: had a feel to it where like you could feel
the emotion behind the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as they got paid, like it's
hard to feel like super angry when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: super rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like album three, like they were
still trying to sound like one and two,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it didn't ring true anymore because
like it's just hard to be that bad when
[SPEAKER_01]: like you got up and your Butler had your
favorite breakfast ready for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I know you had a rough morning
because your favorite Bentley wasn't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was in the shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to take your second favorite
Bentley to the show tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my, uh, some of my favorite
artists from back in the day, I can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to the new stuff, but we say that
if any band gets popular, people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't listen to the new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes like it's hard to, a lot of them
are on drugs and they quit doing the good
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs and they get rich and they live in a
mansion now and there's no, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're totally correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get myself back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always shout out to the entire dude
grows crew in the iry army for accepting
[SPEAKER_00]: the collaboration of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks to Scotty real,
the dude and all of the entire dude grows
[SPEAKER_00]: crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are seven of them that all
put it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to warehouse Kyle for staying at
work late the day that I came to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the crew, the team,
everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one big community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got a blank look on his face when I
said, stay iry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a daily show at like four of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how the fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know how.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get there, you'll see how
they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, uh, for a bunch of stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean that like we're, we smoke when
we get there, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the car for four hours by the
time I get to Scotty real's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, Hey dude, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that noise was me dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really wait to say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the car for four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I 25, uh, is a fucking adventure right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's broken in so many areas and it's
sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the main highway that runs north
south and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get from us to Scotty, it's four
hours on this bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four hours on that highway will make you
want to, uh, not be on that highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the best way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get there, you're ready for a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, of course we get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the whole room stoned when I show
up, then they say, how do we want to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of show are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've seen the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go and they put that shit together
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would have a couple of
minutes, you know, chill out, drinking Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepper, get some water, maybe go take a
piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke an action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because watch brah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's all set up and you're like,
damn, these guys are on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they do multiple shows in a day
because are in a week because they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: knock two, three shows out in two or three
hours and just have it ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer production over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they've added more cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they do a video show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a lot of extra work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do the video show by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta hire an assistant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have enough cameras and it's
just not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The solo grow lessons would be a little,
a little dull to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like watching Chris Delia's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anything you want to touch on before
we start reading these iTunes customer
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing special.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then we are going to make a very
unsmooth segue into reading some iTunes
[SPEAKER_00]: customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you are using the iTunes
application on your Apple device,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got an iPhone, if you've got an
iPad and you're listening to the show
[SPEAKER_00]: through there, that is very, I'm going to
skip Mike's Android comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably works very similarly on an
Android device, but that is not what I
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, iTunes is where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where these comments are coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to leave a comment on the
show, uh, go to your Apple device,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the podcast, simply go to the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably already close to that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open the podcast, open grow from your
heart, go to available episodes and scroll
[SPEAKER_00]: right past there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you scroll past there, you will be
given the opportunity to leave a rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will let you leave an amount of stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, let's see how many,
246 people have given us a five star
[SPEAKER_00]: rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one four star, one three star,
one two star and one one star,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is fair mathematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cool with all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, leave the amount of stars that you
feel appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you think I am not a good
podcaster, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do much effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to change much, but say what
you have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but leave some stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think of the show and
I will read your review on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do that, it sounds a lot like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find the most recent episode
or the most recent comment, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: scrolled away from it because I was trying
to find more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be too far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to me ramble you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this review comes from a person who
calls themselves 401 smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left this on June 6th of 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left a five star rating, but the
headline of their review says don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he meant doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment says, I got a $100
dehumidifier and I have no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs 24 seven, but if humidity is fine,
it shuts down automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think he's replying to something I
said when talking about purchasing or
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting equipment, uh, that sounds like
he's replying replying or referring to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm glad your $100 dehumidifier works
for you and you're in a situation that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be the solution for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may need a $70 dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may need a $500 dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on where you're at and how much
humidity you got to deal with,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big is your room, how many plants,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm glad your equipment works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's my point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Price points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the only thing in a purchase,
but it matters to a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but usually you get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about when it comes to drying
and curing, I talk about having the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier and the humidifier running
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To battle each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that creates a really nice
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only way to keep it where you
want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dial it in within 5% if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing any other way,
you've got a limit on one side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other that you can't control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either the shit can get way too low on you
and there's nothing you can do about it
[SPEAKER_01]: being too dry or she gets too too wet on
you and you can't dry it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does make sense, but Hey,
thank you for the five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please keep listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, leave us another review in the
future and let us know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to move on to the
next review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the dankness and they gave us a
five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by a person with a very
clever name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are called sofa King dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so fucking dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review was left on June 11th of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am loving this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was more though, but Rasta
Jeff is growing the dank and growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on it right now,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing more right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do two episodes a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I aim for a 30 minute
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they've been like 25,
24 minutes lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I would rather put out the
information I'm trying to put out and
[SPEAKER_00]: press stop and be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put fluff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could add some frosting, but there's no
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already, it's a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you need to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Mike's and Mike's the
frosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so gross right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's, I, I don't need to tell
jokes at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or tell a bedtime story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learned what you needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point was proven, especially when it's
a grow lesson, just get to the point,
[SPEAKER_01]: stay on topic and end when you're done
with the info.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, if I'm listening for how to
pop seeds, like when you're done with that
[SPEAKER_01]: segment, feel free to end it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to go on to step
whatever else after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to tell you a joke or
anything, but so sometimes they are short
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like short and sweet is
sometimes the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other times invite me over and we'll
do an hour and a half show where we take
[SPEAKER_00]: the show out to places that that is quite
often a thing, but we enjoy those shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love all aspects of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to save that for the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shout that person out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to sound creepy coming
through the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it sounds really weird in my
headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're coming through compression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds all right in my ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so fucking dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so fucking cool for leaving us a
cool review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they're loving the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a great way to start a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you wish there was more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to put out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: 450 episodes in a can, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go listen, go start at number one and
catch up and then tell me that there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then, but they do acknowledge that I'm
growing the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm teaching people how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands in a lot of pots, lots of joints and
a lot of ashtrays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my version of irons in the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, lots of nails on the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, and growing the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you acknowledge that I'm doing
my best to grow and unite the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the DGC crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm glad that people see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, we've only got two more reviews,
so we're working our way right through
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say only because that makes it
sound like I don't appreciate the reviews
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two more exciting reviews,
which we get to read on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I should feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be really disappointed if they're
not excited now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you they're excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody better jump a shark or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this one says Rasta Jeff is the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't you already excited?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got five stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part is going to be saying
their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, C-B-I-P-S-K-A-B-I-P S-B-I-P-S-K-B-I-P.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm saying some sort of a curse or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, them for picking it, not you for
saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I just summoned some weird demon
trying to say that though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to not say that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to think three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get Beetlejuice popping out,
but S-K-B-I-P-S-K-B-I-P.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read this review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review is easier than the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, this is by far my favorite
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and people have just started calling
me RJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not Rasta Jeff anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people call me RJ when they type it,
but people address me as RJ, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and live chats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like when they're saying it,
they don't just type it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, Hey, RJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even at the dude grow show,
when people were coming to the booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would say, Hey, RJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just knocked over a can of butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's wondering what all that noise
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to fish it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the tan, the torches fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, people were addressing me as
RJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was, it took me a minute
to go Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I was like, who is the
fucking RJ?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, this person said, RJ fills
every episode with incredible information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show always has a light, fun tone to
it, which makes it a pleasure to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: To listen to and learn from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said every episode is filled with
incredible information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the ones when we get rambling,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a nugget of beauty in there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying a couple of episodes ago that
I learned something from some random dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was consulting for him and he made a
comment and I was like, Oh, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: nugget of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, if you keep your eyes and ears up,
you learn shit in the strangest places.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's there's a grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing the grateful deadline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then the part about, uh, the show has
a light, fun tone to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not getting too serious here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm not here, Jeff tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not like school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse doesn't try with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We miss you, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some more outdoor grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta wait for the fucking winner to
talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing his grow thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it's like, yeah, I wasn't,
I hated school, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not, I love learning, but I'm not
sitting at a desk kind of a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you find it light and a
pleasure to listen and learn from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me they fall asleep listening to my
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes me feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you're enjoying the show,
Hey, keep clicking, keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps it up or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a guy or a gal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure it could be a non-binary
gendered person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 2020 by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they wrap it up and they say,
can I even say they can, they wrap it up
[SPEAKER_00]: by saying thank you for all of your hard
work, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the words of
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, thank you for giving me a fun
name to make fun of for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you took that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new friend Subbips skibbip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to skibbips skibbip and the
whole skibbips skibbip family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's just skibbips skibbips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little skibbips skibbips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just little skibbips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they didn't get the, the bips at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kabips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bramble is brought to you by,
by those kind of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one more marvelous review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says full of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what it's going to say when
you start to see when it says full of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't open the whole comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at your phone,
you're like, Oh, what's this one going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say?
[SPEAKER_00]: It said full of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad they went that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one is left by a person who calls
themselves purple thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash your hands, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe they hit it with a hammer and
it's just all purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they grow such a good weed that they
went beyond green and they got a purple
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how color play works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good weed comes out purple sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout it to our friend purple thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was left on July 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Ross Dejef is an amazing podcaster
and gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I've ever been called
amazing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an amazing podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of fun podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 450 episodes and I'm comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this microphone, these headphones,
this little spot right here, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nothing can go wrong right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel so in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I also did a hundred episodes of
another show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably 500 ish podcasts that
I've produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got comfy in front of the mic for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've built a really nice little
setup here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, I always laugh when I find a new
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first things I find myself
critiquing is the sound quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you, uh, you enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate it after listening
to other shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't appreciate it nearly as much
until I started listening to other shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell immediately which podcaster
has taken the time to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a good recording and those that have
just slapped together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll record it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's on your phone, I won't listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you recorded it with your iPhone on the
plane, I'm not going to listen to your
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter who you are.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's more says, I love your energy
and vast knowledge of breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a great statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, energy is hard to convey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody picking up the good rasta
vibes through my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that means a lot, uh, vast
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, that's a good compliment of
breeding and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they noticed that I could breed and
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned so much from listening to
you and I can't get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 451 episodes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get tired of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live feeds plus all the cannabis posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get enough of me eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then they say, thank you for sharing
your fucking awesome bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the gravelly voice at the
end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said you're fucking awesome bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they throw a peace sign emoji in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't get enough, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we got to keep recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a moral imperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep going bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300, 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not cool until you hit a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only 45% of the way there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still remember how psyched we were for
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like an accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at it and I go, damn 450
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means 500 is just, just a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got any
ideas for episode 500, something you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like me to feature or something you'd like
to remember from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Hey, remember this time,
send me some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I don't check Twitter as much finding
the mentions and shit is hard on Twitter
[SPEAKER_00]: for, I don't care as much, but you can
tweet me it's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email is your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what we should do for episode
500.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a clip that you would like me
to feature or highlight and talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you'd like to tell me your favorite
moments, let me know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any ideas yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to start thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your input will matter on that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just ignore your input,
but this one, I will pay a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 500 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for the awesome,
amazing, excellent, exciting, fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had a hater in a little while,
so we're doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person even said, it don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when we confuse and we were some
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't make any sense and we're still
the best that they thought we could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have time to squeeze in one of
these emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, do you want to squeeze in a listener
email right quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just getting warmed up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got all kinds of rambles for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: pimps and hoes, chicks and bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Mike was such in a good mood to get
the recording and said we're just getting
[SPEAKER_00]: fired up, I decided we would take a couple
of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fucking did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, that was pretty nice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Apothecary for
the Stardog dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finished the jar, or I would read you
the post.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already in the jar recollection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the graveyard over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an email in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's real quick, right to the
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a four by eight tint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a thousand watt hydro crunch HBS
air cooled hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good visual started already.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next slide is a mini LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a thousand watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an AC infinity eight inch fan and
an eight inch filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Automatic watering and drain setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six five gallon air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got cocoa and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Description of the new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple of more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of explains what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, this is my first time I've been
buying everything for a year since we
[SPEAKER_00]: bought this new house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent is upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on ducting through the floor
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the smell be noticeable?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, should I buy another fan and filter
to scrub that air down there for a second
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found your podcast and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a grow tent upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me address the just found the podcast
and love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you just found the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope somebody cool introduce you to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a high five for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that I've got an opportunity
to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent's upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to run the ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the floor downstairs, but he's
worried about the smell being noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of options available here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're worried about it, go ahead and
add an extra blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you decide you don't need it,
you've just got an extra filter for when
[SPEAKER_01]: the one you're using upstairs needs
replacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always say go extra if you are
worried about aroma, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go go extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's go extra is the rule, not the
exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not mention where they are,
but it sounds like they need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're so worried about aroma,
is there another option to duct that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He automatically wants to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people are sometimes in the
downstairs of your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost never anyone in your attic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if your attic is just a shitty crawl
space, it's way easier to push hot air up
[SPEAKER_01]: than it is down A and there's way fewer
people in your attic in your basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like you're ready to cut a
six and hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you cut a six inch hole going up
into a crawl space and save, if you cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice circle, save the circle, you can put
that circle back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can teach you how to do that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that circle back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a handyman of any sorts,
you've already got an idea how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through the floor, there's probably
a gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it depends on how old or where your
house is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be a gap between that floor and the
next ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's finished, we don't know what's
going on there, but you're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a finished area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume you're going to have
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going in one and out the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where's that area going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just going to blow that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're heating the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that downstairs is a
living environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is somewhere where
people are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a little bit more
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend venting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a basement, maybe, but that smells
going to come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell is going to come back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to keep trying to rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're forcing it downstairs,
you can scrub it all you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That heat's still coming back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would rethink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to go up into the crawl space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely recommend the carbon
filter attached to the ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your carbon filter,
your blower, and your ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're running that to wherever you
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you've got the opportunity and the
budget, I don't know what your situation
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many variables to this
question that we're going to do our best
[SPEAKER_00]: with what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hang another carbon scrubber in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a tent, I would put it in
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can hang another one in there just
to scrub the air, that is just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: going to clean the smell out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got that one clean in,
then it's going to suck through that other
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting cleaned twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you can put that second filter in
the attic where that air is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: dumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'd put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another great option.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had an inline, I mean my ideal option
for say I had a two story house,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a grow in an upstairs bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd run that into the attic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be a carbon filter at the front of
the line in the tent where the pole was
[SPEAKER_01]: starting from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suck that through the light, out the
ceiling, in my attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to keep in mind the air-cooled
hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to go carbon filter,
duct, air-cooled hood, in, air-cooled
[SPEAKER_00]: hood, out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it continues just like normal,
but make sure that that is sealed up as
[SPEAKER_00]: tightly as you can see and seal every
joint on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always tough having a beautiful new
light hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You slide the brand new ducting on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You slide in that nice hose clamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get it tightened down just how you
like it, and it looks so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to get ghetto as fuck and
grab your roll of duct tape and really
[SPEAKER_01]: seal that bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to whistle in.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're done, it's going to look a
little ghetto, but you're going to solve
[SPEAKER_01]: your air leaks and your life's going to
run smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd run that exhaust coming out of my
light hood, out of my tent, up into the
[SPEAKER_01]: attic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would have another in-line
scrubbing, another in-line carbon filter
[SPEAKER_01]: in the attic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The filter is going to hold a lot of heat
just as it's pulling it out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: That air processes through all of that
carbon powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to suck out the smell and it's
going to retain some of that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like a fire source or anything like
that, but it's going to slow it down and
[SPEAKER_01]: cool it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll cool the air a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface material heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon will absorb the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That heat's going to maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're adding a little heat to your
attic, it's not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're pushing warm, pot-smell
filled air into your basement,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just going to rise right back up
into your floor and back into your living
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the season and your location,
you may want to direct that heat right
[SPEAKER_00]: down into your bedroom or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of the other benefits to running it
into the attic for people who are never up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The landlord's never going to want to get
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's usually an air vent or two to let
heat out of the attic already in place for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to piggyback on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks natural to have heat coming out
of the roof of your house and not out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the back basement window.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow at the back of your
house and you've got some ducting coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the window, have you ever gone out
there the day that it snows and you look
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and see that there's that big 12
inch fucking arc where there's no snow by
[SPEAKER_00]: your window because your hot blower is
going there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that people should think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a side rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get back on track here to our
friend with the carbon filter question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you're going to want to keep
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're new at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that you haven't thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you harvest these plants,
it is going to stink twice as badly as it
[SPEAKER_00]: did while they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be odoriferous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you start cutting into them,
you unlock all of the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's really going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think it stinks during the grow,
it's going to double during harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you'll really find out if you
needed that second filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to harvest upstairs where
the tent is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to hang these plants in the
tent so they can dry and cure there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an entire veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got four to six weeks of
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got at least eight or nine weeks of
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got time to think about it,
but start thinking about it because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can think about is
things to distract people's noses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other options do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put some roses outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put lilacs outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that will distract your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put things indoors that will
change your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe have one of those little
spritzers that shoots out the fucking air
[SPEAKER_00]: freshener every 30 seconds right by the
front door?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that near every door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may smell like pink baby powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that weird smell is,
but it's better than somebody realizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that your whole neighborhood smells like
ganja because of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on where you live, smell could
be your Achilles heel for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell complaints are one of the top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said number one, but the stats may
have changed from things I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupidity is the number one cause lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odor complaints are one of the top three
causes of people being in trouble for
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana to note the address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he coincided going and checking on
all those addresses with the announcement
[SPEAKER_01]: of a ballot effort to shut the industry
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's literally where they got the list
of addresses to go fuck with was just
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood watch and PTA people walking
around and walking their dogs at night
[SPEAKER_01]: going, there's a strong smell at the
corner of 1st and Johnson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's coming from the house on the
corner of 1st Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write that address down in my
little book and turn it in at the next
[SPEAKER_01]: night neighborhood watch meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then honestly, there was just a skunk in
the yard at 1st and Johnson and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting harassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually at 3rd and Johnson.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got a shitty nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the cops get that call, they go to
the door and knock.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the cop smells weed in the front yard
and you freak out and say fuck off,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a warrant and slam the door in their
face, they go, okay, they come back with a
[SPEAKER_01]: warrant and they send you to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, what's happening now a lot with
these busts is kind of random.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people don't know the law here and
they just go, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cops like, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cop counts to 12 and goes,
ha, that could keep counting if I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're under arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard them have a little bit of
grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got like two or three extra,
they've allowed you to pick your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't rely on that, if you've got
one or two or three or four or five over,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would stop at three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd stick with the hard number at 12 if I
were you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they just did a bust here locally
where the press was happy to report that
[SPEAKER_01]: homeboy had 26.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like 26.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also inflate the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the cop math episode where
that's $374,000 worth of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably fucking enough for seven
fucking middle schools to overdose on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the news fucking beefed that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was laying into one of the news
agencies, the other day on social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was just a big other drug bust up
north of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the article reporting it listed like
70 pounds of this and 20 pounds of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fucking they're talking about
heroin and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no like dumb piggy guest of it
in the top where the reporter interviews
[SPEAKER_01]: some idiot guarding the yellow tape and
they go, this is worth blank millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, why is that always in the
headline for the pop bust?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's an advertisement for broke
people in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to do is get to Colorado and
secure a rental home and we could be
[SPEAKER_01]: running a multimillion dollar business
from home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that instead of being Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time they do one of these fucking
reports, it drives me bananas and they
[SPEAKER_01]: always lie about the fucking numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's weeds not worth shit here
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here the cops find real drugs and
there's there's no that part of the report
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden they just forgot to ask
that follow up question or the cop forgot
[SPEAKER_01]: to brag about that this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or more likely, it's just the cop has no
idea what other drugs are worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like they know how much weed
is worth, but they've got to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're comfortable telling when it comes
to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured out some sort of fake
algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay within your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the moral of that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where the fuck we went with
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy another carbon filter, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to set.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question is, will the smell be
noticeable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell the heat, the weird humidity,
all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good test.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a grower and you want to know if
your growth stinks, go away for 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: or like as long as you can be away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go run a shitty hotel room just long
enough to take a good shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's if you've only got an hour,
like go somewhere else, shower,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the smell out of your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go eat spicy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go somewhere weird and
take a shower, make sure to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: significant other with you or give them
some sort of clear heads up what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a hotel and took a shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you did motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you been?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you got to get out for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember working a trim job at one point
and we all just got up to go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't think nothing of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're sitting down at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all got our menus, a couple of
minutes go by, come by and get our drink
[SPEAKER_01]: orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that went a little weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it wasn't just like iced tea for me,
any conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little more awkwardness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I drink showed up, the manager
showed up and was like, get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you guys cannot be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stink so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't us wearing badges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely shouldn't have been
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dumb luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law enforcement didn't happen past us or
somebody who knew what we were up to
[SPEAKER_01]: followed us back to where we were to help
themselves to whatever later after we all
[SPEAKER_01]: headed home for the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just dumb luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just exhausted after a long week
at work and needed a fucking sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the smell was so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was freaking out a whole restaurant of
people, but none of us could smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd all gone completely nose deaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to leave and be gone for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your head clean, get some food in you
and then come back to it and you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to smell it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've driven up to friends houses and
gotten to their driveway and been like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to have a conversation with my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in and you're like, Hey bro,
um, I can smell you from the driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I turned it to David Tell
when I said no man, no drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could smell you from the driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and me were headed somewhere one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was for us a harvester in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we were just stopping by while they
were getting ready to start harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to the corner of the block and
this person was three or four houses deep
[SPEAKER_01]: in the block and corner and you hit the
brakes and started giggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the smell hit me and we both just
started laughing and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that's, uh, where we're headed.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to pull up to one of our,
uh, friends houses and you could smell for
[SPEAKER_00]: a half a block away that he was blasting
BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very distinct aroma when people
are making, uh, BHO concentrates and I
[SPEAKER_00]: could smell that for at least two blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazingly intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will need a carbon filter and I
don't recommend blowing that into your
[SPEAKER_00]: main area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your living quarters or anything like
that, because that is going to bleed into
[SPEAKER_00]: your living quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity is going to come along with
that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going to be smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're blowing out heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're blowing out humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're blowing out aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to change things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend blowing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's going into your
basement, into your bedroom, into the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: tank room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you got going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, if you're, you're too near your,
where your furnace is, I know people that
[SPEAKER_01]: have fucked up how their furnace works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that because of too much air
pressure coming out or not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have sucked out the pilot light by
having too strong of a blower to near the
[SPEAKER_00]: furnace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kept sucking out the pilot light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have had back drafts where my
ducting was blowing air up into a vent and
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was triggering it, making it think
I was getting a CO2, uh, backflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was shutting off a furnace in one
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to tie in your ducting to
existing ducting either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will create those, that ducting that
was ran professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only accounted for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't add yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people vent out into like an air
dump space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen some spaces that have been
neglected for repeat grow cycles where no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's bothered to enter that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the ducting goes to the wall and
the thought for three years, five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I've seen some horrendous,
horrendous things in those spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really think out your whole air system
from start to finish before you really go
[SPEAKER_01]: to town and always add an extra carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you got enough, add one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've covered this part,
but you just put me off on a random
[SPEAKER_00]: thought when you're going to put up
ducting, if it goes outside at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some sort of a cover on the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen snakes and shit, snakes and
shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew exactly where I was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen snakes climb into the ducting,
into people's grow lights, wrap around a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light while the grow light was on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I saw someone
let ladybugs go in a sealed environment
[SPEAKER_01]: with the only out was through the carbon
filter and through the hooded lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I remember taking this fool's light
down and shaking handfuls, fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: handfuls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm making snowballs with dead
ladybugs, dead ladybugs stink so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a dead ladybugs genocide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt so creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I've got this light hood and I'm
fucking shaking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a giant salt shaker with
dead ladybugs, just pouring out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're cost effective than
a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly into the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll fly directly into the fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a fun way for the grocery store to
make money in your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really think through your air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of flaws with that and a lot
of people get caught because they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: properly vent and scrub their air or they
don't change their filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy a carbon filter in January and
two years later they're running the same
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon filter and it's not doing anything
but slowing down their airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on that in about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on it 13, 14 months around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've 10 months, 14 months, replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always go a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always buy a bigger filter and blower
than I need for my space because I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people tell me when they're
working on the backyard or something like,
[SPEAKER_00]: sir, you got a skunk back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, nope, that's the grateful
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some skunk, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great photo of, you've made me
think of it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out of Amsterdam from the early
thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's been memed since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you see a hundred roofs and two of
them don't have any snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, got to think it all the
way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where to raid today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a terrible spot to end
the podcast, but let's do the next email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that one took a weird trip trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to stay on track for the last
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I have a short one,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of the next emails are going
to get us onto a long path that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have us talking more than I want to be
doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it into two shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here, let's go on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, he says, we'll make it two
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to keep going,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's on a roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, and I'll keep going
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really say it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one R in the Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I put a lot of R's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to drop you a line from my
couch in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having a good time on your couch
in Florida, sorry, we bashed Florida folks
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly what we meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I ran a single plant of
lemon Jeffrey in my tiny closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it go for, you ready for this,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little over 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get down to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I was watching those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to the last jar and it has been
curing for two months, flowered for 11
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and cured for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, it's such a different smoke now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon candy got melted into some sort
of marmalade syrup flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I wish you could see the look on
Mike's face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike rarely gets excited about cannabis
aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks like he wants to lick the
microphone like it's a fucking ice cream
[SPEAKER_00]: cone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never enough of it for me to have
it around for two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon Jeffrey does go quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we got to get you a, yeah,
we got to get things set up for you so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can have that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody want my nephew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I edit that or do I leave that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a judgment call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a marmalade syrup flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes with furniture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marmalade syrup flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to leave that in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, no smooth edit point.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had started out so bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transfer me and I know what he means
by bright because I see bright green,
[SPEAKER_00]: bright yellow flavors in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a magical tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds fucking so weird when I say it like
that, but maybe it's my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transformation has been a pleasure to
witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mature lemon Jeffrey still gets the
mind going fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite things about it,
but it's dreamier and perfectly suited for
[SPEAKER_00]: a Sunday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreamier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like about the lemon stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you that like fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, huh, I don't know what's
going on around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in front of me is perfectly cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the left and right, I don't give a
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what I like about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I look forward to the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, me too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you have a clone or if
you're running a brand new seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the two things that really
struck me about the start of this was how
[SPEAKER_01]: did you end up with one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he bought a six pack and only ran
the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you buy a six pack and pop one?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did your friend buy a six pack and give
you one?
[SPEAKER_00]: A tiny closet tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably bought a sixer or got a
freebie or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no idea who this guy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got his name here, but we're not
going to say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says no names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually says that in the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I really liked about this,
it hasn't happened to me pretty much since
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, but I haven't had a bunch of
one strain as like my primary smoke source
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my own sort of half-assed outdoor
home girl at one point and ended up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck ton of blueberry was the last time I
did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got to the fourth QP bag that I
harvested, it was light years different
[SPEAKER_01]: than the first one I smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the last time I got to really
enjoy how a strain matures as I worked
[SPEAKER_01]: through a bunch of it personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was fun and I miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hadn't realized how much until you
were reading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we just go to the store and we get an
eighth of this, an eighth of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: an eighth of this, a quarter of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always get three or four eighths or
quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get home and I immediately grab
the smallest two nugs out of each and jam
[SPEAKER_01]: them into my grinder and make a little,
a combo bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even try?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I do and go with A, B and C
independently, but it's when there's two
[SPEAKER_01]: nugs, A, B and C left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like, Oh fuck, I haven't done
that with these yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to dab my concentrates
individually, but occasionally I'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: like, sometimes I want to take a big,
like I get the crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get ridiculous over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make little combos, but I prefer,
I like to see the, I'm going to take three
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs anyway, so I could take a dab of
this, a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: With concentrates, I usually keep them
separate at home, but with herb,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all a mixed green bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get full cannabinoids,
full turps, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a, I'm a picky bitch for the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude grew lemon Jeffrey for 11
weeks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that they were watching the tri
combs is why they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've gone like 72 or 74 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever gone 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 77 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, excuse all the throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow another seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a clone of this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what's next bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next is he's going to send pictures
of the next grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if they're already two months into
this one, Karen, the next one ought to be
[SPEAKER_01]: just about done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way you think Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, our friend who doesn't want their
name right on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for growing the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come smoke a joint with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what that tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before Mike tries to get us into reading,
another email I'm going to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put down the caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to wrap it up next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get Mike back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's enthusiastic and excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we'll get him here on the
show again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, uh, I had somebody hit me up on
social media and asked specifically if I
[SPEAKER_01]: would cover a piece of national press,
um, in detail on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was the back of my shoe on the
support bar for the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puppies screeching or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nice little unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a specific request and
there's, uh, there's been some federal,
[SPEAKER_01]: some federal interestings and,
uh, a couple of state statewide initiative
[SPEAKER_01]: interestings that I would like to share
with the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you better get some Google documents
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a more info heavy Mike and Jeff
show here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard it from the horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said that last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't mean to call you a horse just
now, but you know, I've been called worse
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thanks for coming and hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really cool episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just recorded a solid hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to, uh, enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, thanks for listening everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it means a lot to us that you're
still listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit us up on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know what you thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was just about to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they harass you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in public, say it to his face at Nemo
punk 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, Pueblo for sensible cannabis
laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemo punk 15 on the Twitter and Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had more to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can hit me up on either of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been getting a lot of Instagram
follows, especially after the DGC seven 10
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I appreciate all the Instagram love,
but you're not going to get anything out
[SPEAKER_01]: of following me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't post shit to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every now and then I take a picture of the
table that we're recording at and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exciting table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the more bad ass kitchen
tables I've ever been at.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, thanks for hanging out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, man.

unlocked, but that's not true.
