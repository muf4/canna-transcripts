[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, welcome to the show podcast
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 456 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, a quick Thursday
[SPEAKER_00]: episode for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of double OG
full spectrum extract from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Legend OG and Sour
Double.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
pine, sour and lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely agree with all of those
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is certainly a pininess on the
inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sourness on the exhale and the
lemon kind of lingers on the tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a very gassy aroma that
lingers in the room when you smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Double.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this product
contains 74.73% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up a four gram jar and it lasted
two and a half days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious double OG full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a couple of emails,
but before we get there, I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a shout out to a few of our friends
from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out and a thank you to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Baked PWN.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant shout out and a
thank you to my friend Tyler.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out and a thank you to Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, another giant shout out to our
buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant shout out to Dustin
P. Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast shout out and a thank you to
Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a shout out to Baz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
holding it down out there, I want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout
out and a fist bump to our buddy Farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: John.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
for the continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show on Patreon, you can do so by
[SPEAKER_00]: going to www.patreon.com slash Grow From
Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, I want to send a huge
thank you to everybody who has supported
[SPEAKER_00]: the show in the past, in the present and
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your continued support does mean a lot to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That support keeps this podcast free for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put out over 450 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never charged a penny for any of my
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Patreon is what allows me to produce
free content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Patreon covers the cost of my
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Patreon covers the cost of my
internet connection every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: My internet connection is expensive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Patreon covers things like microphone
covers so that when Mike comes over,
[SPEAKER_00]: him and whatever guest has been over
before, they don't have to share the same
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone cover because that's a little
bit funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes for things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody who supports
the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes the show possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I just did an NPR sales drive
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, without your
donations, NPR wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the Patreon, I would still do the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that the people
who contribute know that I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the next order of
business.

[SPEAKER_00]: It is free and it is a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should mention about
Cannabuzz is we recently added an irey
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing or interested in
growing or interested in learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: irey genetics, there is a group dedicated
to irey genetics on the Cannabuzz
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: The app is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be hard for some people to
navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk us right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is open the Cannabuzz
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the bottom, there is a little
magnifying glass type icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a, I know this is a lot of
steps already.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top, there's a search bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that search bar,
it will bring up the groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on that group, scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on the group tab,
scroll down and you will see irey
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in alphabetical order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there, join the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, it has got 47 members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a brand new group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great photos in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to join the group and post
some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any questions about irey
genetics, that is a great place to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a great community there ready to
help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am there quite frequently and the irey
army is there all the time to have your
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us on Cannabuzz and join the irey
genetics group.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough talking about Cannabuzz,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people send me great emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of wonderful grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need help in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a stack of emails, two feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's help some folks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said I've got a stack of emails
in front of me, but if anybody out there
[SPEAKER_00]: has a grow question and you would like
some help on the show, maybe you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: got something you'd like to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from someone who calls themselves
St. Stephen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, brother, good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email from our friend St. Stephen goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I have purchased two humidity
and temperature monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are both giving me wildly different
readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like my information about
temperature and humidity to be as accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible, both inside and outside my
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any temperature and humidity
monitors which you would recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple I will recommend,
but before we get there, I am kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about your experiment that you
have done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought two temperature and humidity
monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are hygrometers, I think we call
those, and they are giving you wildly
[SPEAKER_00]: different readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if you bought two of the
same kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you buy two different hygrometers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you buy one at one time and one at
another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one battery operated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one, I don't know what the other one
works, is the battery dead on one is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they the same kind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the same quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my next question is, are they in the
same place?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far apart are they in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very common in a grow space to have
wildly different readings just a few feet
[SPEAKER_00]: apart from each other in a grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I'm up here by the light,
six or eight feet up high in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I come down just directly straight
down, go three feet down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be drastically cooler just a
few feet down if we don't have appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then imagine if you move off three feet to
the left, it's going to get much cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get drastically
different readings throughout the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have microclimates based on the
size of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have 90 degree sections and 78
degree sections based on the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and the efficiency of your airflow
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first investigation is what kind of
hygrometers are we using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the same quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we're using different monitors
and we're getting different results,
[SPEAKER_00]: that experiment is a little bit invalid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need three of the same or at least two
of the same tools to do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment to expect similar results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the same kind,
this may sound crazy, but I would suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a third and compare that third to
those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get a more expensive model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you came to me for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking if there is something that I
would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would recommend a PL grow
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very great monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They monitor your temperature,
your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can water the temperature of your
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a reservoir with water in
there, there's a little probe that just
[SPEAKER_00]: measures that temperature at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will do the calculations on your VPD
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what your vapor pressure
deficit is in the room where the monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: is hung at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are quite affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not expensive units at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really like about the PL grow unit
is I can look at it on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I have to do is open my phone,
go to a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already got the tab saved in my
favorites says PL grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm in, it just takes a couple of
seconds to refresh the dashboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shows me the temperature and the
humidity in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell if the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell if the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell if the air conditioner did or
did not cycle on as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell if the extraction fan to get
rid of the humidity cycled off and on as
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I can set parameters in the PL grow
unit that will send me an email if
[SPEAKER_00]: something gets out of the parameters which
I set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I tell it, hey, when it's 87 degrees
in here, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it hits 87 degrees, I get an
email and it says, hey, Ross to Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: your PL grow unit has detected that you
are above desired temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can go, oh shit, I need to go
to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not where that grow is,
I could drive to the grow, whichever grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these in multiple locations that
I can log into and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could say, how's the grow in Pueblo
West?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the grow in Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can look at all of those grows while
I'm chilling at lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to go anywhere and I can
monitor those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first monitor I would recommend for
your grow environment would be a PL grow
[SPEAKER_00]: systems minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a PL grow systems minder unit
at PLgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while you're there, use coupon code
GFYH25 and you will get 25% off at
[SPEAKER_00]: checkout.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quarter of the price off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna pay 75% of the price for a
minder unit because you have got a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast coupon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, that is PLgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coupon code is GFYH25.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets you 25% off at checkout.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends at PLgrow were kind enough to
send me a couple of minder units to give
[SPEAKER_00]: to my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do something super kind
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Stephen, it sounds like you need some
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a gift from myself and PLgrow
.systems, I would like to send you a
[SPEAKER_00]: minder unit to put in your grow and find
out what is happening in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get that room dialed in and
this is a perfect opportunity to help
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this podcast will come out on August
22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you until August 31st to
send me an email and claim your prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who sent me this original email,
so don't try to pull a fast one on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reply from the same email address and I
will set you up with a brand new free
[SPEAKER_00]: PLgrow minder unit to put in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, my friend St. Stephen who sent
me this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got until August 31st to send me
an email and claim your prize and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: be happy to send you a PLgrow minder unit
to play with in this grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is yours to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like some updates and some
info on how well it works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that, ladies and gentlemen,
a random giveaway in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is more to this email we should
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also say I would like my information
about temperature and humidity to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate as possible both inside and
outside of my tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering now if you are putting
your two individual hygrometers and
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometers inside and one outside the
tent and checking those readings and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting two wildly different readings or
if those two thermometers are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting next to each other and showing you
wildly different readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to figure it out because
you've got a minder unit coming your way
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get your room all dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get that minder unit,
you can find out what actually works,
[SPEAKER_00]: which thermometer hygrometer is working
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can place that one outside of the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the PLgrow system inside of
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like the PLgrow enough,
you can get another one and put that
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have it all dialed in and pay a
lot of good attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really going to have a lot of fun
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am lucky to have central air
conditioning coming through a vent into my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I have been struggling
with heat problems due to the 2000 watt
[SPEAKER_00]: and 3000 watt LEDs that I am using.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, my plants are in flower
and are transpiring tons of moisture into
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like gardening in a rain forest in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just added a duct fan to boost the
airflow from the air conditioning vent and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's helping to cool the room down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still need to do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, should I have the cooler
air blow directly into the tent via one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower openings in the tent or should I
cool the room outside of the tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some great questions in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of great information to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a lot of lighting in it and it
is in a small room that has central air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to cool the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is getting hot because it is a super
hot summer this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about some of our options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question is, do I want to blow
air directly into the tent via one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those lower openings or should I cool the
room in which the tent is in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, we would cool the room in which
the tent is in, but that is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle because you're probably venting
the hot air out from the tent directly
[SPEAKER_00]: into that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't know where it goes from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that hot air is trapped in that room,
it's going to be hard to cool that entire
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to maybe open a door and
get some air exchange where that hot air
[SPEAKER_00]: can get out of that room, travel through
the rest of the house, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand if that is not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we do need to keep the grow
rooms contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go opening that door,
you expose odor, you expose noise,
[SPEAKER_00]: you expose the option of discovery which
may not be something you can open yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to run that ducting directly
to that lower passive vent near the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on how cold that incoming
air is, that's how I would judge how
[SPEAKER_00]: closely to the plants I put that incoming
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really cold, I would back it off a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just nice, if it's like 78
degrees, you may allow that to blow
[SPEAKER_00]: directly right onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about any temperature of air blowing
directly on you for too long will become
[SPEAKER_00]: annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it is the perfect
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any air blowing constantly on you for a
long duration of time eventually will
[SPEAKER_00]: become annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a plant, it will happen more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can't reach over and turn the
fan off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is stuck there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a duct blowing on one
section of plant, pay very close attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to that one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your VPD in that section, your vapor
pressure deficit is going to be highly
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupted because of that constant airflow
and you're introducing that cool air right
[SPEAKER_00]: to that one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do that, you do need more than
one mix fan in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to stir that fresh air in there
and get that environment mixed up so we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't create, like I said earlier,
micro climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do duct that duct right to the
bottom there, feel how cold it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you stand having that blowing on you
24 hours a day at that temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, the plants don't want it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a good temperature, allow that to
blow in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be blowing this across the roots
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be hitting right across the pot
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't be bad as long as it is not
super cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower area can tolerate a little
cooler conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shady down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants should tolerate that quite
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are blowing Arctic chill air,
if it's fucking 68 degrees or lower in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, those plants may not be super happy
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature of the air being delivered
through that ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to make all of the decisions
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's super cold, you've got to back it
off and cool the room, which is ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a large commercial horticulture
environment, that is known as a lung room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more common to treat the room,
get the temperature, the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 levels correct in that room,
then pipe that air into the actual grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's done in other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's done in large flower
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's done in the Dutch
production where they do all the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the flowers that we have come from
Dutch production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are shipped all around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those facilities, they use a lung room
type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those facilities, they are also
ridiculously clean and it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish American grow facilities would take
some lessons from that, but I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: way off track now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you would cool that entire room
and pump that air into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air would just move in through the
bottom vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got an extraction fan at
the top pulling out all of the heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will create just a normal air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air will come in through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pass up over the plants and go right
out through the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally, heat rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help encourage the heat rise up
to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your humidity is going to go up to the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got a carbon filter in
there so you're sucking out the heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the key is that all of that stuff,
that heat, the humidity, all of that air
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be stuck in that room unless
you've got somewhere for it to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your exit strategy for that
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your plan to replenish that
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get rid of that stale stagnant
CO2 depleted air and replace it with some
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh CO2 enriched oxygen that is the
appropriate temperature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common ways to do that are ducts
in and ducts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commonly, you've got a power duct
out, sucking air out, and that naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: draws air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be an option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you may have to do, you said that it
is very humid in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to add a dehumidifier that
will help you get the humidity down in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make it feel much more comfortable
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're unable to add some sort of an
extraction fan or a blower to remove that
[SPEAKER_00]: stale stagnant air from the room or
possibly open a door, you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider adding a dehumidifier to your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with the dehumidifier, you've got
the option of putting that directly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent or you can put that in the room in
which the tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it sucks up a lot of space,
a lot of square footage in your tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider putting it in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing on tables or trays and
you've got plenty of floor space,
[SPEAKER_00]: why not throw that dehumidifier down there
on the floor where you've got some open
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't have all of the details
about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you've got going on,
so I can only give you options based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea, the blueprint that I've built in
my head based on the information you have
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like a dehumidifier may be
the next thing you need to get for this
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I would consider,
I don't know if this is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that you are watering a lot and
the plants are transpiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of moisture into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: An idea is how about watering less water a
little bit more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you don't have all that water
in the room, all of that water in the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the water from transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't put so much water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then water twice a day instead of one big
fat watering once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know the size of pot you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you were in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your options.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is simply a suggestion that may help
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less water more frequently may be a
benefit for this type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing that comes to mind,
you may simply be over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got that much air in the room,
you may have put too much air into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can only let out as much as we give
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we are giving them too much,
they may try to let out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that could be environmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to figure that out because
you're going to get a PL minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to dial in the VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can decide how to set up the
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can decide how to pipe that cool air
into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can decide if we need to add a
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely work on cooling the
room and circulating that air as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely consider getting some
ducting going, some sort of extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to evacuate that old air if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot evacuate that old air,
I would recommend putting a dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room to reduce the relative
humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another thing you may want to
consider is CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to augment the CO2 levels in
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it is all sealed up and your air is
not going anywhere anyway, pump that bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: with CO2 and your plants will go kabang
kapow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know if you've got an
extraction fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your ducting set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you just added a duct fan to boost
air flow, but I don't know where that is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming or going from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that is just a stir fan,
but I hope I get
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already expecting one message from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know if you need more
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back to me so we can get you that PL
minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let me know how it all goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got the ducting set up and the
minder unit in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those are added in, we will know if
you need to add the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there we can decide if you want
to add some CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will make additional adjustments
and we will get that room going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ka-bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ka-pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, St. Stephen, I want to thank
you for a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to getting this PL grow
minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get your grow room dialed in.
