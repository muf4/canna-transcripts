[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, let's do it again Check it out
We used to aim for the sky, now we higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than Mars On the rise till we shine like
the fire of stars Sun, I create,

rhymes, I'ma wire your jaw Check it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: Linus keeps coming out with the slammin'
beats Makes the whole house wanna bounce
[SPEAKER_01]: like static sheets We the track elite,
world star athletes And you can't compete
[SPEAKER_01]: cause your rap is weak, have a seat My
number's game is uncontained by a data
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet I run the game while you drag your
feet I'm unashamed with my love for fame
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause my life was mundane, now it's
feeling magnifique First place and we
[SPEAKER_01]: moving above Fluid in love, under the
influence of drugs You speak hate,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could ruin your mug Oh, you the boss,
I could squash you like a bug Do it again,
[SPEAKER_01]: do it then, do it again
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again, do it then, do it again Do it

[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again, do it then, do it again Do it
again, do it then, do it again the song
[SPEAKER_00]: ended and it got real quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you're at a concert and
you're yelling and then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: the song stops and all they can hear is
you yelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always saying a really stupid word
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had nachos in my butt or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, oil slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them a tweet telling them you're
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at
treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you in part by
treethugger.com, live music lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this show is brought to you
largely by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach
Street, unit F or stop by the new Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver
.com for current store hours and current
[SPEAKER_00]: store specials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually I've got an extra added bonus for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro has an awesome sale on roots organic
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get one toad of soil for $550
in-store pickup or $600 delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This deal is available at both locations,
the Pueblo and Denver store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please contact Hygro to verify delivery
availability, delivery availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how far those guys are
willing to drive to haul you that toad of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure a lot of guys are saying,
how much is a toad of soil Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is a toad of soil is 54 cubic
feet, which is about 350 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in one bag also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of buying a whole bunch of
separate bags, you got one big bag here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running three gallon pots,
that's 116 three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run five gallon pots, that's 75
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run seven gallon pots like I like
to do, that's 57 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a bad deal at all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go get your dirt at Hygro for indoor
growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read the address to you one more
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 6271 Beach Street unit F or the
Pueblo location.
[SPEAKER_00]: That address is in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pueblo location is 618 East 4th Street
in Pueblo on the East side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check out Hygro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to all those sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the show possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made it 21 episodes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of things I wrote down I
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did I put the paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, big shout out to Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running low on Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers came to
the rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some delicious, I'm reaching for the
container right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also recording this podcast in video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I will do anything with
the video, but I am actually recording it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Guava Sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing the container from
Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Mystic is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mystic has Tora Bora in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high CBD mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Guava Sky is the sativa that they
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more of the sativa than I did the
CBD mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll show you the Guava Sky for the
guys with the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also take a picture with the,
they're seeing the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a picture and post this up
online, but I'm not watching the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how clear that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna stay still for a second so it
can focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge shout out to Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Joey?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Shelly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do need medical marijuana,
it does require a red card to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do need your medical marijuana,
that's the place in Colorado Springs I
[SPEAKER_00]: would send you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelly's a cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she knows what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sick, she definitely knows how
to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's compassionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the boss there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's always busy working, but Joey's a
great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's super friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll shake your hand and spend a minute
with you if he is in the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got much love for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little personal note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is, as I'm recording, it's 420 in
the morning on July 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is officially the birthday of His
Imperial Majesty, King Haile Selassie I
[SPEAKER_00]: the First.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know what that is, who that is,
you understand why I'm giving thanks and
[SPEAKER_00]: praise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many thanks and praise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many birthday blessings to King Haile
Selassie I the First.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a little half a second of
silence because it's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A moment of silence would be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a half a second of silence for
King Selassie I the First.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we gotta keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sad to inform you, I'm gonna turn the
music way down for this one also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sad to inform you, we had an event
scheduled for July 27th at the Brickyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get that hookah bar turned
into a dab bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event is canceled and that place is
not going to get to be turned into a
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for advertising an event that
didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is against us every step of the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want us to get this place
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want us to have our event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planned on taking live plants to the
event so that we could do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: education and I could show a male plant,
a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had plants in different stages of flower
for this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't take plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they would confiscate the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't risk taking plants and getting
them taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't do that to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's medicine for my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a caregiver and they're gonna need
that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, the event that I had
planned, that I had talked about for July
[SPEAKER_00]: 27th at the Brickyard is canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't come to an agreement with the
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want us to do the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anybody to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want my plants to get taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have backed out of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I said something on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if I said it on the show
or just in conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to correct something that I
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to a website here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually from Ed Rosenthal's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just got it on my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to do while we're doing a
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to show it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not watching the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should put the video up on the screen so
I can see the video feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the book that I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said something about Red Spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may have gotten it backwards for
what I told you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All credit for what I'm saying right now
goes to Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed, don't get mad at me for saying this on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd want people to know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the critical light period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me give you a quick explanation of
what the critical light period is,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, and a little quick,
because you need to know that to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical light period is the amount of
dark time a specific cannabis strain will
[SPEAKER_00]: take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me elaborate with Ed's article
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big breath because
I've been taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 12-12 formula has been accepted
without question by growers all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one of the reasons for this was
my discussion of the technique in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: my early books.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 12-12 regimen was selected because my
co-author and I reasoned that no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what critical period a variety might have,
given 12 hours of darkness, it would
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most marijuana varieties need
fewer than 12 hours of darkness to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I was talking about with somebody
was they were saying that their plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to flower, and it's not 12 hours
of darkness outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's because of the sunset and the
sunrise have specific color spectrums that
[SPEAKER_00]: are triggering hormones in your plants is
what I was telling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was calling all of this info from
memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I got it backwards to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I said that on a podcast or if I
said that to you in person, I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what Ed Rosenthal has written a
little bit more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If marijuana plants grown outdoors
required a 12-hour dark period to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would not be induced to start
flowering until September 21st,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first day of autumn, when day and
night are equal length.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would ripen six to eight weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: In real life, most modern varieties ripen
between early September and late October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budding was triggered six to eight weeks
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, an eight-week variety that
requires 55 days from forcing to maturity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would normally ripen October 1st,
would start flowering August 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that day in San Francisco, sunrise
occurs at 514 and sunset at 918,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 718, a total of 14 hours and four
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dawn and dusk at another 15 minutes of red
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants use the absence of this spectrum to
measure the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total lit period came to about 14
hours and 20 minutes, leaving nine hours
[SPEAKER_00]: and 40 minutes of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical period for this plant was
nine hours and 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were given just 10 hours of dark
period daily indoors rather than 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would still flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardeners growing indoors who discover the
critical time needed to induce flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: can use this information to get more
efficient use of their indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, plants grown under a 12-12
cycle spend half their time in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these plants have a critical flowering
time of, for instance, 10 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness daily, they can be provided 14
rather than 12 hours of light each day so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can receive almost 17% more
energy, which they use to produce sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: used for more and faster growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that make any sense, you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the critical period for the
specific strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your like Cush strains,
your Indica stuff, that's gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: critical period apparently closer to,
that's gonna have like your 12-hour stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your more equatorial stuff, you may be
able to cut that down just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I heard DJ Short say that he
runs most of his plants on a it's 13 off,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 on, and he said that that shows a
little bit more phenotypical expression is
[SPEAKER_00]: what that does, which means that if you're
growing from seed and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find that keeper, you'll get to see larger
variances in your seed stock if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a little F1 hybrid there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another article, I gotta click back
a couple of steps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh, I learned a whole lot of stuff about,
here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I hate to stumble through that,
but I'm looking for stuff on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: while I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy broke something down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things, cannabis plants,
where's this coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from marijuanagrowershq.com,
slash light cycles and flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says, cannabis plants are referred to as
long night or short day plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: they require a long period of darkness to
trigger the hormone that tell the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: switch from vegetative growth to
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: These light receptors are color pigments
in the leaves called phytochrome red and
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gonna start abbreviating that,
so I need to try to remember which is
[SPEAKER_00]: which.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pigments get their names from the
types of light they absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome red absorbs red light between
600 and 760, it doesn't give me a
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of what those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phytochrome far red absorbs far light
between 760 and 800 nm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what nm is, and that's,
I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I went blank on that one just now
when they wrote it on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two pigments chemically react to the
light and trigger the plant to flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it gets a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis plants, the normal presence of
phytochrome far red switches off the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of phytochrome far red is what
you can manipulate to adjust the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome far red is quickly produced
when plants are exposed to light that
[SPEAKER_00]: contains far red wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there is light, the phytochrome far
red and phytochrome red maintain a
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun goes down or the lights go
out, the darkness gradually switches the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome far red to phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, the phytochrome red
levels gradually increase and the far red
[SPEAKER_00]: gradually decreases during the dark
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of red is a neutral condition
to the plants and essentially tells them
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the light returns or if a small
amount of far red light interrupts the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark period, the red immediately switches
back to far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is without light long enough,
the far red will decrease past a tipping
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This decreased level of phytochrome far
red signals the plants that fall is
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching and the plants begin
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, the presence of phytochrome far
red due to long hours of light and short
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of darkness keep the plants in the
vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant experiences enough hours of
darkness, most of the phytochrome far red
[SPEAKER_00]: turns to phytochrome red and the low level
of far red signals the plant hormones to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really technical version of what
I tried to say where was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna Google that and find out what that
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Googling it right now, NM light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurement definition pops up as soon as
I start typing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visible light is usually defined as having
a wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that is nanometers is what I
thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wrote it small N capital M and I
haven't seen it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nanometers is what I thought it
was there in that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until Safari just decided to freeze up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, this is gonna be a short episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just wanted to come on and talk
about having to cancel the committee for
[SPEAKER_00]: the responsible regulation of cannabis
party that we were going to have at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Brickyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna say that once again in case you
guys are skimming through this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party, the seminar, the educational
seminar we planned to host, it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna take some live plants and show
you guys those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had people that were gonna talk about
all kinds of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a miniature job fair planned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Pueblo does not want that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police department have threatened us
and scared us and we don't want police
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna bow down and just not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best we can do right now for what
we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough begging for your forgiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were planning to come out,
message me and we'll find something else
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're listening on Twitter or
Facebook or whatever, message me and we
[SPEAKER_00]: will hang out since I had that night
booked because I thought I'd be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let's wrap up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give another, I wanna mention that
coupon or that ad that Hygro Pueblo and
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Denver are both doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get yourself a gigantic bag of
roots organic soil for 550 bucks or $600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, dude, 25, seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 57 gallon pots worth of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two runs in a four light room,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that tells you anything with what
you could do with that amount of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of our sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give a shout out to the Grimy
Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grimy Gatsby, thanks for hooking us
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good folks over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out thegrimygatsby.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do that end of the show wrap up
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm gonna try to get Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting married.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually texted me, when am I gonna
be back on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I promise he's coming back soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get him back on the show,
do that outdoor grow lesson for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to King Haile Selassie I the
First.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do that give thanks portion,
but I've been cramming so much stuff into
[SPEAKER_00]: one episode that I haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So officially give thanks to King Selassie
I the First as my give thanks on this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
