[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 478 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me is White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been begging for him to come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got him here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to kick out a podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 478.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, the show is brought to you by
our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you find them at www
.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like to start the show off by
talking about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just took dabs of Miracle Alien Cookies
live batter from our friends at Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross of Alien Cookies,
Colombian, and Starfighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on the package is described as
jelly biscuits and lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say fair?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I don't know that I taste jelly
biscuits and lavender in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taste a lot of unique things,
but I still am not convinced that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: jelly biscuits and lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, the folks at Green Dot
are spot on with their descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, we may have to have a talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love you guys over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it does say
that this product contains 61.89% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the Mac, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor, the buzz, I've been enjoying
it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're red eyed and droopy faced,
so I think it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, let's do some shout
outs to our friends on Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, you ready to get into
this part of the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we should hear the little drum
roll and tone look should come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're thinking different songs,
but we're going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going to be the wild thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got a news article in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make the iPad quit dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing the screen orientation thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very interesting news article
that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caught my eye immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caught social media's eye very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of very interesting comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that part in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into the article,
the source of the article, the Denver
[SPEAKER_01]: Westward, has been doing top notch
cannabis reporting for like 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was taking a note while you were
saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to take that opportunity to
write a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I spelled that to where I can
remember what that says.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: October 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a few days behind here,
but we're going to blame that on taking
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike a couple of days to get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article came out in the Westward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike gave them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have an author?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give an author a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was written by Thomas Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, in random mold tests at
25 Denver dispensaries, 80% fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a scary headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell by social media that many
people read that headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a headline that's going to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people didn't get past that headline
from what I saw on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: By their comments, by a lot of things that
they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll segue into that smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Denver recently conducted random
tests of more than two dozen local
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries to learn more about potential
yeast and mold issues with marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the results were not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Denver recently conducted tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know who did the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was just Denver,
because Denver's not a person who is the
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On August 19th, the city of Denver sent a
notice to every licensed marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in the city warning that
investigators would be conducting random
[SPEAKER_00]: assessments at about 25 stores in the
coming weeks to evaluate contaminants and
[SPEAKER_00]: products on store shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each sample will be tested for pesticides
and total yeast and mold by the state and
[SPEAKER_00]: ISO certified testing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Results of their respective testing will
be shared with each facility and will also
[SPEAKER_00]: be shared broadly within a write-up of
results the announcement read.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to 25 stores, but they sent a
letter saying- I think we're still waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: on the broad write-up of what they found,
so we don't have a lot more detail than
[SPEAKER_01]: what's been presented as of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking for pesticides,
yeast, and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing to know from the very
beginning here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the people that saw this
on social media didn't realize yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold were the potential mold issues that
they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people thought this was moldy
weed, like weed that had powdery mildew on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, or weed that had bud rot in it,
which may not be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be possible in some cases,
but I'm sure that in the majority of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: these things just passed or failed the
microbial test for yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other piece of information that caught
my eye that you've covered now is that all
[SPEAKER_01]: the stores in the city and county of
Denver got a letter saying in the coming
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells me that the odds that any of
this was visibly identifiable is zero or
[SPEAKER_01]: close to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that somebody on social
media said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, why are these people putting
moldy weed on the shelves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't they tell it's moldy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't they trained?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, can you see a mold spore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you look at a mold spore?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see a yeast spore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you identify that without a magnifying
glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: The level for yeast is twice what's in the
air, and that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you clap twice, you're going to fail
the test with your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that here in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find where I was in this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, Although that write-up
is still months away from being released,
[SPEAKER_00]: Westward learned of the test and analyzed
25 Denver Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment dispensary inspection reports
filed over a two-day span in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the reports filed between September 9th
and 11th, 20 listed at least one or more
[SPEAKER_00]: hold and quarantine orders of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should read that more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 listed holds or quarantine orders for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says for cannabis flour, shake,
or pre-rolled joints, an 80% failure rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those disciplinary actions was
tied to plant matter testing above the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum allowed total for yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about the testing and
yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing is really simply done,
but also it's really easy to... We test
[SPEAKER_00]: such large batches that even if what we
send does pass, there's so much left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't test all of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The sample that gets sent to the lab is
good, but depending on how and when that
[SPEAKER_01]: sample is taken, how it's treated versus
how the rest of the crop is treated,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a million different things that
could have led to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you done reading the article?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we get to the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's one more short paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the failed plant matter wasn't
typically covered in white and gray mold
[SPEAKER_00]: like an old piece of bread, but still can
carry potentially toxic fungi that isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: detectable by the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: That supports what I said a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the Denver Department of Public
Health and Environment officials would not
[SPEAKER_00]: confirm whether all 25 of the tests
conducted within that two-day period were
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the planned assessment of
potential mold and yeast issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: though they acknowledge that some were.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a whole lot more to this that I
didn't realize was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine we probably did some
routine inspections during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food and marijuana safety manager Abby
Davidson says, I'm just gonna scan this
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if we need to cover this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically don't do 25 investigations in
a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stress that the random assessment
inspections were part of a long planned
[SPEAKER_00]: research project to learn more about the
shelf life and packaging of marijuana that
[SPEAKER_00]: had been announced in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not targeting any specific
dispensaries, so that's a good thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to actually learn so they
can make this safer for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be fun and ramly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the dispensaries that
failed microbial testing had gotten the
[SPEAKER_00]: flagged marijuana products from wholesale
providers, which were not named in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every commercial grow must send samples of
each harvest to state licensed labs for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial testing before that product
arrives at the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's accurate, according to MED
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, while there are defined
acceptable levels of microbes prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving the grow facility, we are unaware
of the existence of acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: post-delivery microbial levels once the
flower product leaves the grow and winds
[SPEAKER_00]: up on our shelves, says one dispensary
owner who had two strains fail the
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there is no universal test
for products once they hit our shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more to this, but I think we
have covered the part that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that really stood out to
me is, this is a news report in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Westward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The test was conducted by the Denver
Department of Health and Environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't released the results yet or
anything detailing the study that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Westward just got word that they were
doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The notice letter that went out to all the
dispensaries in Denver County had a few
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters in it that they're using to
come up with the 80% number.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw that 20 hold orders were
submitted over a two-day period in
[SPEAKER_01]: October, and they're assuming that those
20 were all part of this investigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that leaves five that did pass,
which is where they get their 80% number.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensary owner that talks about
having two whole strains sale samples fail
[SPEAKER_01]: had two samples fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of how many they tested from
him, but that tells me that the 80% number
[SPEAKER_01]: is nonsense because there weren't 25
samples if this guy had to fail,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they didn't test 25 dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's part of the math that's missing
that we'll learn about in the report to
[SPEAKER_01]: give us a real number.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of this, they don't talk
about a lot of things going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace right before these tests were
done in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I wrote down,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we go into all that stuff now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's go deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado for the last, God,
how long?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, six months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a major legal marijuana
market product shortage this spring in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unseasonably damp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a truckload of rain that we don't
usually get, and environmental controls
[SPEAKER_01]: have been a major hurdle for the legal
marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing indoors on a commercial level
presents some significant challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's humid outside, you're fighting
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your equipment has to get dialed in,
and sometimes it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and everybody had it dialed in for
last year's weather pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some owners don't want to buy more
dehumidifiers this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or didn't realize how big of a hole they
were in until it was too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while there hasn't been a lot of
press coverage on the shortage,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been obvious to everyone in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should have been obvious to
consumers and patients watching store
[SPEAKER_01]: shelves go from having 30 jars of herb to
select from, to having 10, to having four.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've watched it happen for half a year or
more now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is the product shortage was
likely caused by people failing testing
[SPEAKER_01]: because of all the additional moisture in
Colorado for the first part of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a few reports of product being
destroyed because it had too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't pass tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a couple of big recalls and a
couple other companies that have put out
[SPEAKER_01]: notices saying that they had to destroy
stuff over the last six, eight months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that product is gonna have the
same problems until the problem gets
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the weather didn't adjust itself back
to normal until the end of summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still hasn't?
[SPEAKER_01]: So only the companies that really invested
heavily had a chance to fix the problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of product ended up having to be
remitted for retail testing or put on hold
[SPEAKER_01]: or turned into oil and cleaned up into a
usable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for a side note, they retest that
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that is made, they retest that
also to make sure that that passes lab
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they make it into oil,
it gets retested so you know none of the
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants move on into the new process
or in the new product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not polishing turds and
sending you out shiny turds still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they kind of are, but I mean,
it's safe turds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Colorado, I think of it as like the
hot dog of the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a distillate is for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically it's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely cut you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things in Colorado that a lot
of people outside the industry aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily aware of is a thing called
process validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a production facility harvests a
strain, they have to send samples to a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: to get tested for the stuff that all of
these samples failed for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a half dozen different tests
that you have to have done now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the important part is process
validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've harvested a strain a couple of
times over a certain time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't remember what the numbers are
off the top of my head, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like six times in six months or four times
in six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four times in six is what I think I
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a minute since I've had to
schedule this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once a strain, say your blue dream
passes, all its tests and becomes process
[SPEAKER_01]: validated, you don't have to send every
single batch to the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why'd you pick blue dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: That infuriated me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't want to use a strain I like
and to tell people it's moldy because of
[SPEAKER_01]: process validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about the
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of skipped right to the
validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say there are many different
harvest methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you send a thing to the MED
saying this is how my product is stored at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they send you a thing and says,
cool, in container 32, reach to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: left corner and pull out a sample from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they expect you to reach into certain
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more your department.
[SPEAKER_01]: You input the information about your
harvest into a computer program and it
[SPEAKER_01]: spits out a sampling diagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're supposed to do is follow
the sampling diagram and say if your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are on a rack, it'll tell you rack
one and then it'll have a diagram of a
[SPEAKER_01]: rack mapped out like a city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll say in quadrant one,
take a half gram sample and quadrant
[SPEAKER_01]: three, take a half gram sample to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll do this eight times per rack and
come up with a four gram sample to send to
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it's supposed to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposed to be what a lot of people do is
take the choices for gram four grams they
[SPEAKER_01]: can find in their their sampling section
and send that because what's most
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable for the consumer is a high THC
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't even want to guess
the percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large portion of the consumer says,
what's your highest THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their first question when they walk
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need the highest test we can get out
of this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company is looking for the highest
testing sample that's going to pass the
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully most companies are
following the diagram because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: best way the state's come up with so far
to ensure that product's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once your sample has passed or you've
got that strain pass three or four,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, six times over a certain time
period, you don't have to test it again
[SPEAKER_01]: for half a year or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there ways to cheat and do you think
people can cheat or do cheat sample
[SPEAKER_00]: testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, and yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an infinite number of ways to
cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a speed limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of ways that you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm pretty sure most grows do the
best they can to pick the best foreground
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sungrows have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I ask them, how do you do your
testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, we just grab stuff just like it
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, do you clean it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything special?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of them I find it amazing that
they just send a sample just like normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many ways to manipulate
those samples to increase potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to make sure that you don't
have microbes on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know testing well enough to spot
bullshit when I'm flipping through a stack
[SPEAKER_01]: of tests and I'll see it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw someone I kind of respect
talking about a 40% pre-roll and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, well, that's at least 12% Keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's just there are certain
things that once you do this for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can spot nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so clearly the process is being
manipulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even when it's done honestly,
and that's sort of what I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I ran it, I ran it as honest as I
could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that pissed off some of the people
above me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still had killer lab tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we still had good lab tests,
but not everyone is going to do their best
[SPEAKER_01]: to follow the sample polling method.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if they do follow the sample
polling method, once a strain becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: process validated, it doesn't get tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for at least a couple of months.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing how easy it is for these tests
to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have 50, 50 samples and
two of them will fail for no identifiable
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just two of those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all in the same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing different for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of the samples came back dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been the person taking the
test sample, handling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person could have sneezed in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sneeze, a deep exhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A deep exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got, let's hypothetically,
my microphone cover right now is a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to send for sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wipe it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, this is a sterile bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been touched by my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worn a glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been treated well in the grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, this bud passes microbial
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, now it fails yeast testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My breath, I know that sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your breath does it too, asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our breath carries enough funk and mold
and yeast and different microbes that it
[SPEAKER_00]: will make that bud fail the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how sensitive that test is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for two times the yeast that is
in the air naturally and that is not very
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that if we went to New York
where they make that delicious New York
[SPEAKER_00]: pizza crust, everything would probably
fail because there's probably that much-
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having a lot of trouble in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that much yeast and shit in the
air already because of just what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really easy to fail that test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple things that I assume
could be happening and I may be jumping
[SPEAKER_00]: over three mic, but people could be
cheating the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: People could be doing something to the
sample that they're sending that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing to the full batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's making it to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it gets tested and it's obviously
going to fail because they cheated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that possibly those buds,
those products completely passed testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they got sent to the store and they were
cool, but they've been in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens to the jar at the
dispensary all day long?
[SPEAKER_00]: They pop open the jar and they stick it
right under my nose and I take a big ass
[SPEAKER_00]: breath in and then I exhale right into
that damn jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do it again, unless I don't
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pass it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really like it, I'll take two or
three of those and I'll blow right back
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think about doing it,
but what if you got a cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you got, I don't know,
what if you're a fucking mouth breather?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right into that jar all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of things in this story
that make me think most or all of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: honest mistakes or issues with the process
validation procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies were issued a letter saying,
hey, we're going to be checking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every company in Denver got one,
which means all of their suppliers,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if they're outside of Denver,
heard about it, which means everybody knew
[SPEAKER_01]: this was coming two months in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know about you, but if
somebody tells me they're going to come up
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if my room's clean at noon,
you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got an inspection on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Tuesday, before everybody goes home,
the last thing you do is make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's tippy top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if people were cheating the testing
or specifically manipulating the system to
[SPEAKER_01]: put product that wouldn't pass testing
onto store shelves, they would have,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at least in my mind, known that
they were doing that and taking steps to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that, oh shit, we've been
breaking the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come check.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to make sure all of that product's
in the safe for the next couple of months
[SPEAKER_01]: and only put out stuff we know is going to
pass muster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even super shitty restaurants pass
inspections because the health department
[SPEAKER_00]: tells you when they're coming.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because so many tests failed and
because of some of the other factors that
[SPEAKER_01]: I know are in play, like the product
shortage, process validation, Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty weather, environmental control
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is that this is just an issue
we've identified in our lab testing
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also start in the article by
saying that this was part of an
[SPEAKER_00]: educational experience for everybody is
kind of something that they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't even have the report yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know how many tests were run,
how many failed, what they failed for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guess is that the Denver Department
of Public Health and Environment is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to take further steps to investigate the
samples that failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, that's not just something
that we're like, oh, you failed testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try harder next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff that happens after
the failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out how many of those samples
failed for yeast or mold or possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or unfortunately there are things like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli that are available that are happening
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also may find that some of them are
held for pesticides because they did
[SPEAKER_00]: mention pesticides in the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get to see how they did the
inspection, my guess is they said,
[SPEAKER_01]: they sent inspectors to 25 randomly
selected stores in Denver and had them buy
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain number of samples at each store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you picture an inspector,
like that's his job all day, he shows up
[SPEAKER_01]: to work on Monday and gets his assignment
for the day and he's got to go to six weed
[SPEAKER_01]: stores and buy three samples at each
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't know walking in as a customer
unless he really quizzes the blood
[SPEAKER_01]: tenders, which wholesalers produce that
herb, and all of that stuff's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out in the aggregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we get a look at the data,
we'll see if this is an issue with the
[SPEAKER_01]: production line, if it's an issue with the
packaging, if it's an issue with storage
[SPEAKER_01]: at the store or handling at the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to learn a lot from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what the tests find,
that's going to mean a lot to those
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and how it's handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's powdery mildew that they passed
on, shame the fuck on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's bud rot, shame the fuck on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's mold or if it's yeast,
I mean, that you can't even detect with
[SPEAKER_00]: the naked eye, you got to have a lab test
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I passed on a bud that failed the yeast
test, I couldn't feel bad because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no way I could have known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't be too upset at them for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's powdery mildew or bud rot,
that's something we got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be some sort of course of
action for that sort of shit, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: corrective action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is one of the bigger hurdles
to legalization for the existing
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get over the moving all the way into a
fully legal, regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy a can of Pepsi, it doesn't
matter which state you're standing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the fuck you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how cannabis will be before I
die.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so, so difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And should that can of Pepsi kill you,
you flip it over and there's a number on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back that says it was made at this
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your relatives know who the fuck to
sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know which batch of Pepsi to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a terrible product anyway,
so I'm glad we went with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they know which batch it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know which stores that went to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know where to go recall it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado now, we've gotten to that
point where if I bought a legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: product and got sick and went to a doctor
and said, these are my symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I think did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I bought a bag of herb that had some
mold on it and smoked it anyway and now
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to track that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I bought it at this store.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the growth was produced at.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the batch it was harvested from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just grabbed some concentrate off the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back here, it's got RMCF.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's recreational marijuana cultivation
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number starts with 403R-.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read you the number
because that's none of your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is where the flower that made
this concentrate was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where this was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there should be an accompanying MSDS
sheet for every product that was put into
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there should be a Department of
Agriculture pesticide log for every
[SPEAKER_00]: product that was sprayed or applied to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of history that comes
with that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are part of the MED or any type of
inspector, I know a lot of information by
[SPEAKER_00]: these numbers just because of my
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this information and all of the lab
testing that we do in Colorado is why we
[SPEAKER_01]: know our legal industry isn't a culprit in
the vaping illness thing that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: around right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know for a fact it's not Colorado's
legal marijuana industry that's making
[SPEAKER_01]: people sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a medically infused product
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the back, I've also got a batch
number here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of details on this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably tell you which plant
numbers went into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means in the cultivation,
there are probably 1,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to guess in this
cultivation where these flowers came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you which plant numbers from
that cultivation were turned into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot about the testing in
Colorado or in every legal state that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people don't realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't think about lab testing
and how that gets performed on everyday
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't occur to us to think down
that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people that I've talked to assume
legal cannabis gets lab tested at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: place they lab test everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the federal law,
every legal state literally has to create
[SPEAKER_01]: their own special testing labs that only
test that state's legal cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to build that whole thing
from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally, it's like we'll just follow
the layout for opening a testing lab that
[SPEAKER_01]: would test anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't because fucking step two is
apply for the DEA license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you tell the DEA, you're about to
open a testing lab that tests cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: samples for a state's legal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show up with machine guns and steal
your computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that literally happened the first time
Colorado started doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've literally had to build all of
this from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the federal law with
cannabis, we're literally inventing the
[SPEAKER_01]: wheel right now in real time when it comes
to lab testing and legal production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did this with edibles already
when the newspapers went around and bought
[SPEAKER_01]: up edible samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a black eye for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people got smacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And six months later, how much better was
the edible side of the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the edible market is amazing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lab testing component to this has
been a real slow, ugly, just nightmare to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're getting there in a couple of
more test runs like they're doing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll really be in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go to any cannabis store
that's legal and licensed in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be able to be totally confident in
what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, you can be pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fairly confident that if I buy an
edible right now that it will be as potent
[SPEAKER_00]: as they say it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do allow a plus or minus 10%
variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're buying a 15 milligram edible,
that makes me a little sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't buy a 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy 100 or 350 is what I purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I'm going to get at least 100 or
350 out of that bad bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be all right for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to segue into this next bullet
point I've got that says black market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it really entertaining on social
media that people were making the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: that, oh, the weed at the dispensary is
moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I buy black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The comments I saw were all, a lot of the
anti-pop people, every time they see a
[SPEAKER_01]: recall or something like this,
they're like, see, regulation doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, this is regulation working.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it's supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just take the marijuana out of
it and it makes it easier for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cantaloupe place made some
cantaloupes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of those cantaloupes didn't look
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We back solved the problem, had to pull
some cantaloupes off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's regulation keeping consumers safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happened with a bunch of Romaine
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see a bunch of activists going,
oh, ban all the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: They finally got all those Volkswagens off
the side of the highway up a little north
[SPEAKER_01]: of here from that big recall from three or
four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a random thing to share with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we live about 20 miles south of a
Volkswagen graveyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Volkswagen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new cars though, so it was extra
creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to have security guards driving
around it to protect that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of recalled Volkswagens parked
in very organized fashion in this giant
[SPEAKER_00]: field with security guards just rolling in
the aisles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like a full sporting event
stadium for a major football game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like a damn Volkswagen car
dealership, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no people and no sporting
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of security guards doing
loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because those were all decent cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they finally figured that shit out and
finally got those moved off the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, recalls happen in every industry
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is regulation working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally creating something that
we've been told we weren't allowed to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to create for 80 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be baby steps backwards
and there's going to be fuck ups and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be things that we have to
stop and scratch out and rewrite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That rewriting and rethinking step is
where Colorado is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're past talking about if we should do
this and we've moved on completely to this
[SPEAKER_01]: is how we decided to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start taking a look at the rules and
regs we put in place originally and start
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluating each one of those rules
independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too harsh, not strict enough,
too strict, or if we got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the lab testing, clearly we don't
have that process right yet, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already did this with edibles and now
the edibles in Colorado are on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the dispensaries aren't getting it
right, imagine what your home grower that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't educated is doing to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's literally zero protections in the
black market and there's this weird thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that happens where I'm trusting you to
sell me pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trusting me to buy pot from you and
we're both trusting each other not to say
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about this to anyone official.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's cool if I tell my friend that
I know a guy that I can get herb from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cool if I tell a cop to go to my
guy's house and bust him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because there's that implied trust,
even if we don't really know each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I'm going to provide this service for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to enjoy this service for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to get each other in
trouble about it, but we're going to break
[SPEAKER_01]: the law together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If two people were going to go commit
almost any other type of crime,
[SPEAKER_01]: the level of relationship and trust has to
be a lot greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cannabis industry, it's very chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very laid back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically non-aggressive and
non-violent until the rest of the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market world comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most people, if face value when
they're interacting with their cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier, it's friendly, it's
lighthearted, and there's a lot of trust
[SPEAKER_01]: in that relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But none of that applies to quality of
product and lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy selling you herb just wants you to
continue buying herb.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're going to do that,
end of story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever has to get sprayed, whatever has
to get applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk in the door and say,
hey, do you have Snickle Fritz?
[SPEAKER_01]: He does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to go get it out of the other
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grab the bag of Blue Dream,
write Snickle Fritz on a different bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw a handful in there, tell you
this is their last quarter of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're hooking you up special for
only $20 more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to somebody on another
podcast about the state of the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were asking about black market in
individual areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about in Colorado,
there is a black market, but it is not as
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent as many other places because
we've got so many options for dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: with lab tests and other quality options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody left the comment that I'm
corporate cannabis now and I'm against the
[SPEAKER_00]: black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying that there aren't many black
market dealers around here because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are so many dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start my little rant by saying I am
not against the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that didn't exist, I would not be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That used to be the whole market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many places, the free market,
the gray market, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it, we know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-regulated market, the homey
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from there, so don't think that I'm
against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I was saying is that's not available
here so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my mom wanted a topical, she's not
going to go to the dude down the street
[SPEAKER_00]: and hang out at his house and watch him
play Xbox until he gives her some fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to pay cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needs a couple topicals to make her
hands feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of market we've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was going to go on what Mike was
saying about we just trust each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a friend who is in the free
market and you were supporting him,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love friends supporting friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your business that way, but maybe one
day kindly ask him, so what are you using
[SPEAKER_00]: for pesticides, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask him accusingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it look like you're worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be like, what do you use for
pesticides, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you use for pest control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Compliment him that the weed is good and
then be like, what are you doing to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the bugs away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what kind of nutrients do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about the product that you're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is your flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how long are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you'll know if the product burns
well or not, but people say that the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market- Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, it's what they've been
exposed to, what they've been around and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they've had access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against the black market,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say that the black market is better
than the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys may not be educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing any black market grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the legal market, I train people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a trainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I train them on pesticide safety,
pesticide handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Mike, fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We follow a lot of regulation to make sure
that the product is not moldy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the product is not funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike's getting a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the get the hell out of your
signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the five minute warning,
but the black market exists because the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you buy your shoes on the black market?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want no knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you buy your t-shirts on the black
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you buy your groceries on the black
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you buy your headphones on the black
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you want a new laptop, do you hang
out in the Vespai parking lot until you
[SPEAKER_01]: see the dude walk up out front with the
used laptop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just walk the fuck into Vespai
and talk to the Geek Squad guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost nothing Americans buy or people
anywhere on the planet buy is from the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market because the legal regulated
market is infinitely superior in every
[SPEAKER_01]: way, except sometimes cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the cannabis community,
I came from a pure black market world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we were 18, 19, Cali went
medical and it changed the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden there were medical
marijuana jokes in movies like,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that for your glaucoma?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the world fucking started to change
and we slowly started to take baby steps
[SPEAKER_01]: into the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a million reasons why the
existing community and market is resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a consumer standpoint,
there's only one reason to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: shop with the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reason why most of the
growers we knew that operated back then
[SPEAKER_01]: are working in the legal market in some
fashion now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us did head right over to the
legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or immediately moved to a state that
hadn't changed their laws yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people that moved east
when Colorado went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people that came here when
this place went legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was growers on the East Coast
that were dying to get legal came here and
[SPEAKER_01]: growers here that would rather make a
black market price per pound or per ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: moved east.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this product is not worth much
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, let's get wrapping up to
get you out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I support the free market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got somebody that's helping you
out, let them do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to bash on anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not against the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somebody said that I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was almost pushed to get legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can feel that I was almost
offended that somebody said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's not what I meant at all
by that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're probably listening to this
conversation now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, dude, I hope you realize I'm not all
against the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from that black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that without that, there would
not be this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big love to the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything against the black
market, but like people that drive don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of things against people that
walk either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just there's a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing, Pimpin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, thanks for hanging out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I got to bail out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I hope I didn't get you in trouble for
keeping you for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
