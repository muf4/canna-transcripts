[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 175 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call me Ross DeGefo and I thank you guys
again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got through the whole intro without
coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took some monster dabs of some
distillate over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some 92% THC distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just made my brain spin a little bit
and it made my lungs try to wobble a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to
the podcast, my friend Sammy, the painted
[SPEAKER_02]: chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to be here for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for making the long drive down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, it's a little big deal to
come here and hang out with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: my man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to have a long time listener
and a long time friend here on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen you in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been, I don't know, like three or
four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been way too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine too, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a little bit busy, but hey,
you know, we're just talking for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both parents and we're both proud
poppers of beautiful girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we let them consume, consume our
lives, which is definitely priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, big shout out for being a good
father, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Family's the number one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Family, family, family.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys go give your, go give your kids a
hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always talk about taking a fat dad and
give your mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go, go give your kids a hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out with them for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any kiss, kiss them on the forehead.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter how old they are, boy or a girl,
go embarrass the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go kiss them right on the forehead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when their friends are around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brother man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can people find you on social media so
that they can stalk you while they listen
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook, Sammy Chanclaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean shoes, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened is my buddy, he used to make
himself up a bunch of cool names on
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook, like Al Guapo and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was clowning him, telling him,
give me a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He called me Sammy Chanclaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Chanclaz, you can't mess
with the Chanclaz, so whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on Instagram and everywhere else,
it's The Painted Chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Painted Chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys go follow my friend The Painted
Chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check him out so that you can see how sexy
he is, so that you can see his beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a wonderful ganja grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned a lot from a lot of people,
but I just try to do my best and give the
[SPEAKER_03]: planet all the love I can, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my favorite thing about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were saying a minute ago that you're
trying to get your name in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: and get your foot in the door,
basically, and get to be known.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you are a humble dude and
you're not so worried about getting out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and getting known.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that when the time is right for
you, it will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are a ganja soldier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a warrior.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're doing it kind of behind the
scenes and low key, but you're doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram followers are cool, but putting
heart into it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing stuff for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what it's all about here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just try to focus on me and doing my
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, my little family,
you know, that's the main motivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know a lot of people have been
affected by cannabis and need cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: help or are against it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just always trying to go push it
forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best way I can, all the love I can,
because that's the way I was raised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love in everything you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love in everything you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, man, I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already thank you for joining me,
but I want to thank you for backing me up
[SPEAKER_02]: on Facebook the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sammy and I, I was a member of a Facebook
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Sam is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I call you Sam or Sammy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't called anything from Jim to Bob,
so it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to stick with something close to
Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was in a Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am no longer a member of that group,
but I don't have any issues with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to sound like an asshole,
but people post the dumbest shit in
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be like, I've got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, you should pee in your
plants and then put baking soda and
[SPEAKER_02]: vinegar on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: No one wants to Google or do anything for
themselves at the beginning, but that's
[SPEAKER_03]: why I get mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm like, why are you asking
what you can do with this when you know
[SPEAKER_03]: you can go Google this?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 101.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got a 101 thing, go Google it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably in a book that says cannabis
growing on the front of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just bought a cannabis growing
book, you could go to the glossary or the
[SPEAKER_02]: index, look for your problem, find it,
turn to that page.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd find tried and true solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, you want to go to Facebook and
ask some dude with a clever fucking name
[SPEAKER_02]: who doesn't even have pictures of a grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like telling you to do the
weirdest shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll go in there and I'll be like,
no, you shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will give a factual reason why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will state a positive way to
improve your solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that way or improve your
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way you're not because a lot of
the things they say will cause you even
[SPEAKER_02]: more problems than you started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people hate on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're an asshole just because you're
an expert doesn't mean we can all do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're afraid of a little bit
of work and spending a couple of bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make as much as they can off
of this crop without putting any energy
[SPEAKER_02]: and money into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that day, that's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I jumped in it because I'll see
them going at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can handle your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you know your stuff, but when they
attack, like, calling you an asshole and
[SPEAKER_03]: all this shit, I can't handle that because
just one of the best dudes I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, since I met you,
you know, whatever we've been friends or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I see that happening,
I won't allow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll come in and I'll interject and
get your back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll try to challenge my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, come on, I'm not,
I don't know everything, but you're
[SPEAKER_03]: messing with the big dog here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'll let loose and then I'm
gone too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't want to be put in their
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They booted me real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you kept a screenshot of me,
what they were saying, which was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, they're trying to say this,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tried to back me up and tell you,
you're like, you don't, you said something
[SPEAKER_02]: about you don't even realize the wealth of
knowledge you just eliminated from this
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those people, they have no idea
what's even happening when I'd comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just look at me like, they call me a
know it all and try to talk shit to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I'm really trying to help
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if I went over your head and I feel
like a lot of the problem is ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bruise some egos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and I don't know it all also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know how I did learn, I'll admit a
lot of the way I learned things was by
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way you learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to learn unless you try
and fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing for a long time,
so I made a lot of mistakes and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to admit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm willing to share my mistakes with
people and they don't even realize that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying I did what you're trying to do
and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and they just get mad at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of doing all the trial and error
that I did, I'm going to tell you how to
[SPEAKER_03]: get past that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe it's not the nicest because
you're not understanding through text,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm going to tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to lead you astray and like mess
your plants up worse just because you
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't ruin your plants because some
dude on Facebook with a cool name taught
[SPEAKER_02]: you to spray something on your plants in
week nine of flowers so that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, I'm glad that, dude,
I've got cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have as wicked bad cotton mouth as I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dabs fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That distillate put my dry face on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the biggest dabber, but one kind
of small dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling it, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another person here.
[SPEAKER_02]: She took a dab and she is now tucked in in
bed, probably snoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a champion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking forward to trying to distill
it because I never have, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: wait till after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you saw what it did to her,
you kind of change your whole mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be able to talk to the people,
not just laugh at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet dreams down there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's going to listen to this show
later and be like, OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm kind of glad that those people are
failures on the forums and on Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: groups because it's those groups kind of
contributed to me starting this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hanging out at Maddie's house late
at night and answering grow questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what contributed to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another podcast I would
listen to and people would ask questions
[SPEAKER_02]: and instead they'd be like, I have spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of saying fix the room,
find the mites, clean up and then maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: use a type of product, they would say,
oh, go to the store and buy this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get this store made by this
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it this website for this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them that sales this code,
which is my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're making a lot of damn money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't even a real email from a real
listener.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could feel that from a very specific
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do that to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that podcast kind of inspired me to do
a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Tim, Tim Martin had a podcast for
a little while there, the JDR,
[SPEAKER_02]: the John Doe Radio that inspired this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Coral, Coral Reefer, of course,
I wanted to fill the gap that she was
[SPEAKER_02]: missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She did all the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do the gross stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Adam Ill had a fun podcast with
his what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to kind of join that vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of so all that stupid stuff
is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is actually the Facebook group sucking
and then all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to help people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's part of why I started the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without all those crappy info avenues,
the show probably would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's a good thing that those
things out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess some bad things always come a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inspiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, why not lead people the right way,
you know, in a fun way instead of making
[SPEAKER_03]: it boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone wants to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier to listen than to read
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can absorb this show while you're
driving down the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be on your way to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be in your cubicle with an
earbud in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be doing whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to a podcast and learn how to grow
weed and meet Sammy the Painted Chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are scrolling through his
Instagram right now and checking him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, that feels weird when I
say that, but I hope you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about your growing history
and stuff, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give you some credibility here on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're cool as shit, but nobody
else here has met you before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, I always had my mind in,
you know, since I don't know, eighth
[SPEAKER_03]: grade, whenever I first tried marijuana,
I always wanted to grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once I was old enough to do my own
thing, I started just dabbling with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: playing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And reading, I read for about 10 years
before I ever put a seed in the ground,
[SPEAKER_03]: just because, you know, knowledge is power
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's something I encourage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it just so happened that I think
I joined Roll It Up or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the old forums that existed back in
the day and I discovered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm cool because me and my buddy were
looking for a soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're up in Denver, going to start
growing, going to get going on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And found that forum, you know,
a lot of good knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very classic forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's still out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone wants to check it out,
you can learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, it was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met a lot of good people through there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met all the guys over at Geek Farms out
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those guys, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Samson Mallory while we're at
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Raya.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew B.
[SPEAKER_03]: That cat's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I met all those guys, you know,
and we just started talking on the forum,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started learning from them and taking
what they taught me, applying it to my
[SPEAKER_03]: plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trial and error.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first one I grew was a purple
Kush I got the clone of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my own first tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: My ex-wife at the time surprised me for a
gift, like got me a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to let me grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went full bore, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just learn, learn more,
learn more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything progressed and I got to where I
am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Started working over at a concentrate
products in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great place to work for.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many lights were you running over
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was eight rooms, 75,000 Watts per
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 2000 plants at all times in
there and learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learned a wealth of knowledge over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys were good, but you know,
I'm not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking to do everything that I can,
you know, just progress more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much my story in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got so much heart,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I love about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I noticed about the
cannabis industry, though, is people just,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't stay in the same place for very
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go in and I don't mind doing the bounce
around because I love seeing the facility
[SPEAKER_02]: and learning as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, I've kind of,
it's like a class.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, I've made all the friends I
want to make here and I've learned as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to go find another
facility to play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I am now keeps me really happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep, they keep accidentally putting
bonuses on my paycheck, so I can't argue
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They treat me really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're super cool people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, weed nerds, that's where
I learn most of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all the weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed nerds everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every nook and cranny, you know,
you can find us always.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had weed nerd stuff wrote down to talk
about later, but we can go that way if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's introduce the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a lot of my listeners aren't
familiar because people are listening in
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia and countries I can't even
pronounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make that mistake a lot to assume
everyone knows who and what the weed nerds
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a guy, a group of people,
but mainly it's led by the ringleader is a
[SPEAKER_02]: dude by the name of Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's on Instagram, but they keep
deleting him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Subcool420 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's what it is, but I'm not a
hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time this episode comes out,
they will have deleted him.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will have a new account.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so his name is Subcool and he runs a
seed company called TGA Subcool Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: TGA stands for the Green Avenger.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are known for strains like Space
Queen and Vortex and Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jilly Bean actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about another member of TGA,
Ms. Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: MZ period Jill made a strain called Jilly
Bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Jelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Jilly because it's named after Ms.
Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Subcool's wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a badass grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a cool lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does some breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: She made the Brian Berry cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is part of the TGA Subcool family.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also Jinx Proof who made the nine
pound hammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a crazy cat, but I like watching him
blow his glass over there on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love his be positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a child with autism and he also
suffers from a seizure condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his be positive attitude is just really
cool to see him use cannabis in a positive
[SPEAKER_02]: way and educate everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so shout out to the whole Weed
Nerd crew, but that's who we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Subcool is the ringleader of the weed
nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the leader of the TGA Subcool seed
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've also got a side company known as
Natural Homegrown Wonders, which are some
[SPEAKER_02]: of Subcool's best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the weed nerds are, so he does a show
on YouTube called The Weed Nerd and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can watch him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a little head banging.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a little ganja teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll speak his mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I better give him some credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of inspired this podcast too on
accident, I think, without me even
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing it because it's the same damn
format now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without Sub, I wouldn't be growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be where I am for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My photography, you could tell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, he made photography what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and Nugbuckets, Nugbuckets,
that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, Nugs takes the pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another guy, Freebie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And TC, TC takes some good pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: TC Curtis, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Spliff, a bunch of great cannabis
photographers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sub's got a show called The Weed Nerd
and then all of the folks that follow the
[SPEAKER_02]: show and are on the show are considered
weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a weed nerd nation and it's a
big group of folks that have heart about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, that love to grow and breed and
support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a bunch of weed nerds is
basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I endorse you to go encourage you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said endorse, but I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high as shit to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage you to go check out some weed
nerd stuff, check out some Subcool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have a lot of opinions
about Subcool and his products,
[SPEAKER_02]: but go see for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people have opinions about people,
but if your attitude doesn't match with
[SPEAKER_03]: someone else, just look past that and look
to what they're bringing, look to their
[SPEAKER_03]: message and you can learn a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people probably don't realize how
many strains Subcool has brought to market
[SPEAKER_02]: that are amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plush Berry was a Subcool creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plush Berry, the original, they're
bringing her back, but there's some stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Plush Berry is one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Miss Jill was making a bunch of
Plush Berry seeds recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I loved, I've bred with Plush Berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a really cool purple phenotype of
Plush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that, what you've bred with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what made the Black Cherry Cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's some fire right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get onto that later, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Jilly Bean too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking on Facebook a little
bit and you actually wanted to talk a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about LED growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: LED growing, I use it for veg when I've
got a full thing going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use it because of course it saves power.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know how to use them, you can use
them right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people who like to put
them down real close to the plant because
[SPEAKER_03]: they think the closer the better,
but there's actually an opportunity,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you want to say range there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 18 to 12 or 18 to 24 inches
away from your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beans focus and you can actually tell
when you're adjusting your light if you
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the shadow, the way the color
split.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you do that, they just take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that's actually right with just
about every light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to find, I'll call it the sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get too close, you can probably
tell yourself when you get too close,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's real hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start backing off a little bit,
you could tell, oh, that's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you go a little further,
you're like, oh, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: light on my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants can tell the same damn thing
and they want that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to find out with an LED and you
say it's 18 to 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been out of my own grill for a while
because I've been bouncing around,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I believe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks right to me from what I see in
all the pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't realize that the
lenses have a different angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's like 60, 90, and 120,
the way the beam shoots out of the lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 90s will shoot them straight down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go for a 90, so I know all that light is
just going straight to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can take that into account and get
what you're going, you can do a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: good with your LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are either afraid
or mad because they don't understand how
[SPEAKER_03]: to really roll with the LED because they
bought one for $25 off eBay, put it two
[SPEAKER_03]: inches from their plant and their plant
did nothing but give them a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: frost.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are afraid to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say go with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The new plants, the lights they have
coming out are doing some good things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not Mr. in the LED light industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a brand that you've had good
experience with or a brand that you would
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend to buy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Off the top of my head, I wouldn't want to
just ramble off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect that more than you trying to
spit something out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather not answer than make people
mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plead the fifth is always the best bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said ex-wife earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never miss an opportunity to keep your
mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything major I'm going to have
to do other than finding that sweet spot
[SPEAKER_02]: and the major difference between growing
from an HID like a high pressure sodium to
[SPEAKER_02]: watering is going to be different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Watering is going to be different because
they don't use as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as hot in the room so it doesn't
evaporate as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to watch that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it myself, got some fungus gnats
and kicked myself in the ass a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those damn fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to watch them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to watch your watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I adjust from doing that to
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he was undercut a little more
because they're not so ... Clean up the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom because you're not getting the
penetration.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we mean is clean up the underskirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's leaves on the bottom of the plant
that aren't really necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just little shitty growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little tiny, just crappy veg
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to turn into anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to trim fluffy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut that off of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The energy where that was being wasted
will now go up to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get a fatter chunkier bud up at the
top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean up that underside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me for clearing the throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to clean up the
underside a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe pull the plants out a little bit
more and spread them so you can get more
[SPEAKER_02]: light to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a little bit more pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, de-foliate a little bit and then
water a little bit less frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to have to change your
feeding other than the amount of water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to have to change your feed
measurement?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always just kept it the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go from LED straight to under-HID.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't light under that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of rough on them, but hey,
they're tough plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like it rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think treating them a little bit rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants, they're meant to be outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow ... I've said it before,
they grow on Afghan plants in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd grow on a rocky mountainside where
the wind would blow on it and the sun
[SPEAKER_02]: would beat on it and it would get rained
on and a goat would piss on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are meant to be durable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not sissy plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardy, hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the strongest plants there are
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it weed for a reason is what
Mike always says.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing it, even if you have to
try it, almost kill this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I have learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to put it through some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may spit out some seeds you don't want
it, but it's still going to survive
[SPEAKER_03]: through all the stress you give it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you're dragging it right from the
LEDs under the HIDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it grow more stretchy or does it stay
bushier with the LEDs?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll start to compact more and get a
little bit more bushier.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it a couple weeks of a little
bit more veg under the HID before I flip
[SPEAKER_03]: it and put it in the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get them a little bit more used to
the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you notice a stretch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it stretch at that point?
[SPEAKER_03]: It stretches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to keep them real small.
[SPEAKER_03]: What size pots are you using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using a little one gallon inside a six
by six, a three by three by six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little sleeve green type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those little tiny saddles like that
with little pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually running a phenohunt on ...
Excuse me, I keep burping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep drinking Dr. Pepper to try to get
rid of the dab throat here and it's making
[SPEAKER_02]: a terrible combo of burps and throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing a phenohunt in solo cups and
I've just got them in a little tray so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can water the tray and it absorbs
the water, but it's working pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never done it like that, but you can
fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fit 28 cups in one of these trays
and then I eliminated close to half of
[SPEAKER_02]: them because they're male and female.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled the boys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 14 or 15 males per tray and
they fit beautifully in there and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: pour water in the tray, but I just got
them in solo cups and I love a tiny grow
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day once in a while, I like to do a
solo cup challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was on the forums, that's always
fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a bunch of people, go in a whole plant
in a solo cup, see what you can do with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, depending on how long I let them
go, two, three inches, they'll stretch
[SPEAKER_03]: real nice real quick for me and then I'll
flip them.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's more of a height thing for me
than a time thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never put anything on a timer or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how I try to have a height
schedule, but I just broke my schedule by
[SPEAKER_02]: seven, by five days a couple of days ago
because these plants are too tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked in and I was like, no,
these must go into flower now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower in me kicked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, forget a schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants have to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I turned into Ari Shafir in my
head is what I just realized, but I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I got to flower these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just listened to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Schedules are fine for a good little rule
of thumb, but the plant will tell you what
[SPEAKER_03]: it needs, what it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't do what it doesn't want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't force it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can force it to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about the only thing you can force
it to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned to force it to do some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've forced girls into boys, but anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of, I just dragged plants into
flower, you guys, just to give you kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: an update on some new shit I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently purchased the entire setup of
Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the base newts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the shine and I got the push foliar
spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put some Grateful Dog plants into
flower and they are getting fed the full
[SPEAKER_02]: Veg Bloom plus a little bit of aminos from
Photosynthesis Plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus occasionally they're getting a little
bit of Humble Honey is what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting fed for carbohydrates and that
yucca extract just to give them a little
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture, a little fluff, a little taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just went into flower a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: In like nine weeks, I'll let you know how
they come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first memory of you is that Grateful
Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's such a great strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one of my top five of all
time, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write Grateful Dog on here as
number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to put myself as one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top five is going to be that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to say the Blue Jay was
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love the Blue Jay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember what that cross is?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was from Geek Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Jilly Bean, the Marmalade Fino,
crossed with Oregon Blues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon Blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban is always one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love me a good Durban.
[SPEAKER_03]: Critical Mass, that's one of my most
recent favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that five?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we did Critical Mass, Durban Poison,
Oregon Blues, the blue one that I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: read the next word from, and the Grateful
Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else you got on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Who?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love me some Dr. Who.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine Pound Hammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was Dr. Who from Jinx Proof?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Dr. Who was from Odie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Odie, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Odie Diesel, those Oregon
boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all those Homegrown Natural
Wonders guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do some great stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a really good taste of Agent Orange
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Colt or Cannabiscuit,
whichever one his name was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds familiar, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lived up in the mountains here in
Colorado, and I went to see him one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me some tasty, tasty Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted like I bit of Valencia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that orange velvet clone that Miss
Jill had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss that cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a good cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: He kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, sometimes we got to
disappear in the mountains or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the old school growers from
Overgrow and from that generation,
[SPEAKER_02]: they all just disappeared like they had
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just, you know, people had to
take off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much too quick is what happened.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one that just knocked my socks
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grateful Dog is all I've tried of yours,
so I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we might fix that before you leave
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not be upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite strain to grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: To date, my favorite one to grow would
probably be the Blue Jay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blue Jay was a fun one to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't grown it in a minute,
but it was easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_03]: The buds were nice and pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about an easy strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're just like, oh, an easy grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one recently, River Song.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been trying to get out of
my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: River Song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that one on there because River Song
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the cross on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: River Song was, oh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Raya out of Raya Love out of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon Blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to think about it and get back
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love that Oregon Blues out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to taste that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's what they're working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nugbuckets is working on one with that
River Song called Crooked City Blues or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: The River Song crossed with, oh shit,
now I'm going to draw a blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been thinking about it all week,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be like, oh bro, it's this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's totally acceptable to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out that stuff coming out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got it all up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you reminded me when you got here that
I gave you your very first dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honored.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that was like when everything was
first starting to get going with the dabs
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything and the butane and
everything, my lungs, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just there, give me a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that day, that was like our
second time meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were we in line for the Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave you a dab in the line,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking joints and I was like,
well, let's get down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember there were people like from
Florida around us and we were just doing
[SPEAKER_03]: dabs and everyone's eyes were like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People did not know what to think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy with dreadlocks giving dabs to his
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I wasn't going to be like
that about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a person over here taking dabs with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, yeah, that was a fun time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had fun all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was rad all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just held around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you would call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you helped me out with something
on that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to call you out on air on
the podcast because yeah, but you helped
[SPEAKER_02]: me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have sit there and watch you just,
no, I had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sammy saw a door that was open and helped
me walk through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably saved me like a good hour and a
half in line.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, dude, that line was nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to go to stuff like that,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Standing in line sometimes for a cannabis
event in the hot sun can just drive you
[SPEAKER_02]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you paid a lot of money to get into
that place and you got to just stand
[SPEAKER_02]: outside all day because they're not
prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get all sweaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any predictions or have you
heard any news for the cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver or Colorado or anything for 420
this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: After last year, all that fiasco,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of how I've been too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to, usually by this time of year,
I start getting prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started getting seeds on deck and
packaged up and having some ideas and
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing what I'm going to do and start
looking at hotels.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is honestly the first conversation or
thought I've put into it so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that first year that I went,
it was kind of like, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get back to my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: High times.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on for the cannabis cup this
year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado misses you, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to throw in a shameless
advertisement because I have to do an
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisement in this podcast and I didn't
do it, but I missed the podcast because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get to see my friends from Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, I tried to be smooth about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed the cannabis cup because I don't
get to see my friends from Handmade
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys are so cool, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Adam is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jackie's cool as shit.
It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole crew that they bring.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's cool is they bring the oil slick
crew with them because they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get the oil slick crew and the
handmade crew together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we all get goofy and take a bunch of
dads and high five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their shirts are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not wearing it for a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually wearing an irie genetics or a
hoodie or a girl from your heart hoodie or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, but their printing is so
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't want to print.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had graphic artists turn me down to
print my stuff because it's too many
[SPEAKER_02]: colors and it's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, it's going to cost like 20
bucks a shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, but Handmade Apparel does
them very affordably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm getting at you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Support my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will make t-shirts, hoodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will print whatever you need printed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the art in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's an amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can make hat pins.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll make stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get some stuff made from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know that you're listening to the
Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're running a super great special
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to quote prices because it
may change by the time you listen to this
[SPEAKER_02]: episode, but please check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love, much respect to the Handmade
Apparel crew and the oil stick crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys out there on the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope everything goes well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely do yourself a favor with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need shirts, they're the place to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They print all the industry shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where Subcool gets their shirts
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where I get all my shirts done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the Girl From Your Heart hoodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sitting in a box over there behind
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The print on those things is so bold,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of weird wearing a hoodie with
my face on my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine that, but hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how life goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a hoodie with your face on your
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of people have a hoodie with
their show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you leave here, you might have
a hoodie with my face on your back,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you might have some iRegenetics
flowers in your lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I wouldn't be upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to make everybody happy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you know what I've noticed,
and I'm trying to make it sound organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did write this down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chefs, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chefs are always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not always, but a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good growers and breeders are also good
chefs, and I know you're the painted chef,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've made comments on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I said I burned myself,
and he told me to rub mustard on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like, rub mustard on it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do that because all I had was
that French's crap, and that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yellow?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're supposed to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that mustard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really mustard?
[SPEAKER_03]: That French is like- What it basically is,
it holds vinegar on it, and the vinegar
[SPEAKER_03]: will kill the swelling and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned that from my grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the old grandma trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rest in peace, grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my grandma too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably up there cooking
together, sharing recipes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about chefs, being good growers is
where I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez, I threw myself way off talking about
our grandmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble, ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like it when we grandma ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chefs are good growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's anything about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the flavor, or is that the work
ethic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably all of it, and attention to
detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you said that because I made some
notes, and that wasn't one of the things I
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a chef, I'm not going to get on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I call myself a chef,
because I was a chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me my whole kitchen to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in charge of everything,
but it was my artwork on a plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone didn't do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch out, because here comes Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be a perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just transfers over to the world of
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier in a grove, because you don't
have a time limit to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get this plate out in this amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think chefs can make the adjustment
better and be better at this, because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: less stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same amount of work and the same
amount of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're that kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that, because you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the chefs, I've worked with several
chefs in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have several chef friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that works in a kitchen loves to
consume some cannabis before, during,
[SPEAKER_02]: and or after work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am associated with a lot of people in a
kitchen environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all that special kind of crazies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can work a 12-hour shift and then
drink for eight hours right after work,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then sleep for four hours and be back
at it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, how the hell do you guys do
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hot in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're outside the kitchen with a
chef, you'll hear him saying, I hate the
[SPEAKER_03]: kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get them in that kitchen, get that
pressure going, and every chef loves that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am no good in a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would know the first thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lost in a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd throw me the hell out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd cut myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be over quickly, but I love pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to work under pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I notice myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys at work look at me like,
you should probably slow down because
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to be out of work by noon if
you keep going that fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know any other speed than turbo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, turbo is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much fun getting work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you look back and you're like,
look at all this shit I just got done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're covered in sweat and your back
hurts, but you're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other guys are trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I've got done an hour
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take dads and hang out with
my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to puddle buckets into-
Five tables back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, five tables behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think chefs make great growers and
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: That work ethic, that attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say the cleanliness,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do anything without- Okay,
you can, but you don't want to eat at
[SPEAKER_03]: those restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten sick from a non-clean
restaurant before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard for me to eat out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because of the cleanliness,
yeah, but it's mainly because the way
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation happens and stuff,
if it's not perfect, I'm pretty mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: My daughters are always like, dad,
don't, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll see my face change.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do what you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hardest thing just to keep your
mouth shut and not let that eye bulge out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh God, I don't want to say
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If their food's messed up, oh,
watch out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will get in the manager because those
are my girls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, that's just me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to protect the ladies like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just silently eat it and get up and
leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, man, thanks for that shitty
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until I got deep into my chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what it takes to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can do that, you guys should be able
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost any restaurant where we live around
here, it's all pre-prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: At most restaurants now it's all
pre-prepped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just got to go in there and pour the
bags into the thing and put the right
[SPEAKER_02]: sauce on top of it and bring it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't even put the three bags
together and heat them up properly for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing you cooked on this was the
patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to call out the restaurant,
but I went to a restaurant that they get
[SPEAKER_02]: great reviews on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are decorated up like they're fancy,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They act like they're real fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: One person in there gave me a sort of a
look when I came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm 6'5 and I have dreadlocks
to my ass and I was walking through a
[SPEAKER_02]: fancy restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the look.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my dreads tied up, but they still
looked at me like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had bright red eyes because I had just
taken a dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: They served us what are they called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Raviolis as an appetizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plate came with I don't know what it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a light colored sauce with a dark
colored swirl and it was real fancy
[SPEAKER_02]: looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just smacked the microphone making a
swirl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it had the raviolis on top of that
and there was a little side of marinara
[SPEAKER_02]: and a side of another sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they had put fresh Parmesan or
something on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that looks fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grab me one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a bite out of it and I'm 95% sure
that it is the same frozen ravioli that I
[SPEAKER_02]: bought at Sam's Club that I have in my
freezer over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt embarrassed for myself for getting
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, that's a fucking ... You
were fooled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have made that at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I felt bad for the whole restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just lost all credibility to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an industry wide thing and it sucks
because people are going out there
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking they're going to get this great
meal when you can go to Walmart and pick
[SPEAKER_03]: it up and throw some stuff together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get some ragu and go do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably could have microwaved those
things myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I look at it is why I charge so
much when you're just doing something that
[SPEAKER_03]: someone could do for themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can do a little better,
make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't charge so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get more people and have fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was money hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see eye to eye with a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I jumped out of being a chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got tired of working, working,
working to put money in other people's
[SPEAKER_03]: pockets when they're keeping me at minimum
wage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, thank God for Colorado being
smart and let me grow cannabis for a
[SPEAKER_03]: living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love Jeff for letting us grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, so many things line up for being a
chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love your eye for detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in the passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I was going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to pause the sneeze and be smooth
about it, but then my whole face just
[SPEAKER_02]: twitched.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved the sneeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to sneeze in the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can edit all that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was I now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have any more notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I know what I was going to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain will remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't even remember what I was
going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next topic, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything else you want to throw in
here or do you want to start wrapping it
[SPEAKER_02]: up since I'm going to have to do an edit
break right here anyway, which is not
[SPEAKER_02]: anything rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of editing in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was going to ask you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, I'll just be quiet for a half a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll throw it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, while I've kept you for long enough,
I'm sure you've got like a two hour drive
[SPEAKER_02]: to get home from here, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're getting up six inches over
the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that really what's happening right
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what my mom said before I left.
[SPEAKER_03]: She likes to check up on her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking earlier and it says that
we're going to get some snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's 8.15 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to get home till
10.15.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you got a real life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to work tomorrow because I know
the weekend is off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice time with the kiddos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend some time with the little tiny ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I really appreciate you coming and
hanging out driving two hours to come hang
[SPEAKER_02]: out, do podcast with me, that is cool as
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you inviting me up and doing
it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you need me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here any time you're passing through
my neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're by that exit, you better message
me somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you my number right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it through Facebook,
my phone number, sort of straight text me.

Instagram stuff.

you know to be checking out his kids and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at his weed plants My kids on there
occasionally, but yeah Instagram's way
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm more active on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yeah, we're probably gonna fight
over something if you get on me a Facebook
