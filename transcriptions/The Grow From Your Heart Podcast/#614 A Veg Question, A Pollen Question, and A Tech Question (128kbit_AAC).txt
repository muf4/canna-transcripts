the screen and of course I did include a
[SPEAKER_00]: link in the show notes and the video
description to make it nice and easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my friends before we jump into the
email portion of this show I want to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of shout outs to a couple of
special friends I owe a giant shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends graybeard lemur priest and
stabby mcmotherford stabwood big thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: and big shout out to those gentlemen and
everybody else who supports us on the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord channel I will admit I'm not on
the discord channel very often there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot going on on discord it's a lot for my
eyes to follow for my brain to follow on a
[SPEAKER_00]: phone screen so I don't do discord as much
as I should I could be there more honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there often but those three
gentlemen I just mentioned before they run
[SPEAKER_00]: the irie genetics the irie army the grow
from your heart basically everything rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: jeff involved they run the discord channel
for me and they have recently done a few
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrades several people have done have
given some financial contributions to
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrade the discord server thank you guys
I appreciate that I will be there more
[SPEAKER_00]: often if you're gonna make it fancy and
special I need to show up if you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do that I need to be there I wanted to
make sure to stop and do a big shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the gentleman who made it happen
graybeard lemur and stabby and also excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: me also send a big thank you to everybody
who contributed financially to the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a big thanks to everybody who
just hangs out joins mingles whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: do on discord thank you for being there
thank you for being a part of the irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics discord channel discord feed
discord link whatever you hip kids want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it I'm glad you're there I'll be
there more often all right let's quit
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling because I can do that all damn
night you guys know that let's jump into
[SPEAKER_00]: the email portion of this episode I've got
a message here from patreon from a person
[SPEAKER_00]: who would rather not be identified their
question goes just like this we'll jump
[SPEAKER_00]: right into it with hey mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff I got a mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff out of you that's great this is
my first attempt at growing out a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for pollen collection that is always
a fun project I love growing out male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I love doing a male fino hunt when
I'm searching for a male plant to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with I will grow out packs of seeds and
I'll find the female out of there just
[SPEAKER_00]: like you guys do but I will also find a
stellar amazing keeper male out of there I
[SPEAKER_00]: will flower out my male plants sometimes
I'll flower them out to like weeknights
[SPEAKER_00]: nine or ten just to see exactly what they
do I want to see what the bud structure
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like see how they react to some
abuse some problems some issues check out
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas and flavors look for colors see how
things change over time when I'm growing
[SPEAKER_00]: those males I love to do a nice male fino
hunt so let's read more of this message it
[SPEAKER_00]: says it is my understanding that a male
plant will bloom just like a female plant
[SPEAKER_00]: should cycle so I'm going to switch to
1212 and wait that is exactly what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do the male plants work just like
the female plants they are photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photosensitive just like the the female
plants it's the same plant you just got
[SPEAKER_00]: boys and girls so yes once you put them
under 1212 about 1014 maybe 17 days later
[SPEAKER_00]: you will definitely see that that plant is
in flower it will start producing pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: you are collecting pollen right yeah so
you're going to I would recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: before you put it into flower you have
something in place to start collecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen maybe if you've got a big piece of
glass you can set that plant on put the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen right on a big piece of glass and
let the pollen rain down on the glass that
[SPEAKER_00]: works some people will take the pot and
build you take a paper plate and cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: slit down the middle and then you wrap
that around the base of the plant and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen will fall into the paper plate that
depends on how big your plant is I've used
[SPEAKER_00]: a 22 inch kick drum head to collect pollen
one time I did that and all of the static
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity on the kick drum head I'm a
drummer I got bass drum heads laying
[SPEAKER_00]: around I used the wrong damn drum head and
all the static made the pollen move away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the drum head so as it fell it did
some weird static reaction it all landed
[SPEAKER_00]: outside but get creative on things you can
collect the pollen and start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about that before you're into flower you
don't want to be moving that plant around
[SPEAKER_00]: jostling it a bunch once it does start
dumping pollen because then you'll really
[SPEAKER_00]: knock a lot of pollen out of it it'll be
easier to collect if you just already have
[SPEAKER_00]: your collection plan in place so where do
we go from there switch it to 1212 and
[SPEAKER_00]: wait that's absolutely what you do it will
start dropping pollen you'll notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said a moment ago around day 7
you'll start seeing sex around day 10
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll start making pollen sacks around day
12 they'll start swelling around day 14
[SPEAKER_00]: through 17 they'll start popping open
possibly by day 21 they'll definitely be
[SPEAKER_00]: popping open and dropping pollen they will
continue to drop pollen for several weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: up to week 9 week 10 depending on your
light cycle the vigor and health of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant but they will keep on going that
first pollen in my opinion is not the most
[SPEAKER_00]: viable the most active pollen you want
that little bit later pollen pre pollen is
[SPEAKER_00]: all I'm gonna say you can fill in the joke
there you want the viable active pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes out later all right so the next
part of the question is when should I
[SPEAKER_00]: begin and end my pollen collection I've
already said that you should have your
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen collection devices in place early
so you've got your your your kick drum
[SPEAKER_00]: head your paper plate your glass your
mirror whatever you're gonna collect that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen on if that is already in place
you're going to collect pollen as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts falling in my opinion some of
the better pollen is the latter falling
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen so just let it all fall and you'll
gather a little bit of the pre pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get a bunch of the good pollen all
on your collection vessel there it will
[SPEAKER_00]: all be great if you're going to do a
method where maybe you've got a container
[SPEAKER_00]: and you use something to tap the pollen
into the container I would wait until you
[SPEAKER_00]: see it really drop in pollen it'll be
sprinkling a little bit and then you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see those male clusters they'll just go
kapow you'll know you'll say well shit all
[SPEAKER_00]: the male flowers look like they're opening
and it's time to collect that pollen at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point get the main top of that plant
have whatever you're collecting it into if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a pie plate or a shoe box or whatever
you're using and just tip that plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: and just give it a little jostle and
pollen will go all over the place you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get a lot of pollen turn off the
fans don't have a lot of blowers going on
[SPEAKER_00]: be wearing clothing that you can change
quickly or maybe minimal clothing maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just a t-shirt maybe no t-shirt if you can
head right to the shower if you got some
[SPEAKER_00]: dreadlocks have those things tied up the
pollen so you're gonna collect the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: tap that pollen into a container where do
we go I've got two directions I want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen is going to be very viable and
very potent be careful when you go into
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room with your female plants
water will deactivate this pollen so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going into your grow room spray
yourself down with water change your
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes you should be safe but maybe spray
those female plants in there before you as
[SPEAKER_00]: you enter spray them with the with the
water that way the water will deactivate
[SPEAKER_00]: their pollen receivers and they won't get
pollinated the water will mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: deactivate the pollen if it comes in
contact with it you just have to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: the water contacts the pollen talking
about water you've got your pollen in a
[SPEAKER_00]: collection vessel we need to get all of
the male flowers and chunky male parts out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that pollen I would start by spreading
it out as thin as you can sometimes I use
[SPEAKER_00]: tweezers depending on how much pollen I'm
storing I've also used different sifting
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques I've used pantyhose on top of a
jar I've used a flower sifter before get
[SPEAKER_00]: the male parts out of the pollen is the
main part here and keep the pollen as dry
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can keep it I said it a moment ago
water and moisture destroy pollen so
[SPEAKER_00]: before you store your pollen airtight into
any container make sure that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely 100% dry we want to dry this
shit out of it I leave it sit now I cover
[SPEAKER_00]: it with a paper towel leave the container
open it's just covered so that nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: else gets into it no wind will disrupt it
but then all the air can escape all the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture can escape once it is super
crispy dry I scrape it up with the credit
[SPEAKER_00]: card I put it into a container with a
silicate packet you do not want the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not want the the botanic the what's
it called I can't think of the humid a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack you don't want the the Boveda that's
the word my brain wouldn't fucking think
[SPEAKER_00]: of you don't want a Boveda pack or a
moisture pack you want a desiccant pack
[SPEAKER_00]: that will suck out all of the moisture you
do not want any moisture in your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: once you've got them sealed up or dried
then you can seal them up store them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool dry dark place that is how I would
store the pollen so let me make sure I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: answering the questions put it on 1212 yes
it will begin to flower going to switch to
[SPEAKER_00]: a 1212 light cycle and wait when should I
begin and end my pollen collection if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got your pie plates or your drum
heads in place it will begin collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen early that pollen will be viable I
just recommend that later pollen so
[SPEAKER_00]: collect pollen for a period of time and
you'll have plenty of good pollen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix there when should I end my pollen
collection once you've got enough if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're only going to make a small batch of
seeds you only need a small like a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: dram if you know what a dram container is
a half a dram will create plenty of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: a full dram will make a lot of seeds any
more than that you can really pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out of a room so it just depends
on how many seeds you want to make but let
[SPEAKER_00]: it go maybe let it go like four or five
weeks in a drop in pollen if you can and
[SPEAKER_00]: see the difference in the colors of that
early pollen and the later pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: watch it change feel the dustiness feel
the grittiness it may change from like
[SPEAKER_00]: baby powder to a more sandy texture as the
the plants start dropping pollen later in
[SPEAKER_00]: the game but then again make sure you
clean yourself up before you go in that
[SPEAKER_00]: girl room if you got girl plants and
flower because that's when you do risk
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating plants you don't want
pollinated all right so I feel like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: answered most of this when should I end my
pollen collection you've probably got
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pollen after like a week or so of
collecting pollen if you're gonna manually
[SPEAKER_00]: collect it you could probably get it two
or three times it will keep reproducing
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen so you could tap it out collect it
give it four or five days tap it out
[SPEAKER_00]: collect it give four or five days do it
again or just let it keep on going grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are a lot of great methods for
collecting pollen it says surely the male
[SPEAKER_00]: would be done for my purposes well before
say week eight of a normal flowering cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: yes they will be done they could be done
well before week eight I say 14 days to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in that's two weeks two weeks of
pollen collection another week just to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fun we're only at like five weeks total
into flower there so you could collect
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pollen in that amount of time I may
go a little bit longer just to just to
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough pollen because I do larger
pollinations than you're probably doing I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I have rambled my way through
this question quite a bit I like giving a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of attention to the patreon questions
I just feel like they deserve the extra
[SPEAKER_00]: time and attention let's see yeah I think
I covered you bro throw that fucker in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1212 and start collecting pollen and then
have a strategy why did you select this
[SPEAKER_00]: male is it just the boy you've got
sometimes we do what we can do with what
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got I understand but did you select
this male for a purpose does he hold a
[SPEAKER_00]: trait that you desire to pass on to your
progeny or does it just have a cool name
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to mix in with another name
or something I'm just curious why you've
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen this male that is one of the most
important parts of breeding then the
[SPEAKER_00]: second question why have you selected the
females with which you have chosen to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed I could just be because we're
working with what we've got but is there
[SPEAKER_00]: some selection happening do you think that
this male will provide something to this
[SPEAKER_00]: female structure is this female lacking
something the male can fix is the female
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking or the you know what I'm trying to
say bro is there a rhyme to your reason or
[SPEAKER_00]: you just put in two people on a date so
they can sport fuck or do you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding plan in mind that is my main
question as long as it's well thought out
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will turn out very well then
the next fun part bro once you pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: all these plants you got to finish them
out then the real fun is cleaning the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out of the weed that's always a good
time if you make as many seeds as I do
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll take you a minute then you get to
grow out a bunch of the seeds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just made that is so much fun don't give
out any of these seeds until you've tested
[SPEAKER_00]: them out you've got to grow them yourself
if you do give them to your friends make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure they know that they are tester seeds
that you haven't grown them enough to know
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're problematic or matter didic
straight up mutants if they got terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: germination ratios if you got bad male to
female ratios if they throw bananas in
[SPEAKER_00]: week seven or something discover all of
that stuff before you go shipping them out
[SPEAKER_00]: to your friends all right to my anonymous
friend who helps us out on patreon thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for all the support I do appreciate
seeing you pop up in the message if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got any more questions please do feel free
to shoot them my way on the patreon all
[SPEAKER_00]: right I've got a couple of more messages
here in front of me let's jump right to
[SPEAKER_00]: let's do this one here this is gonna be a
fun one this one says do they want their
[SPEAKER_00]: name said oh it's squirrel master and I
learned where a squirrel master came from
[SPEAKER_00]: cool name super big shout out I like that
let's keep going it says I love the show
[SPEAKER_00]: bro keep it up I promise you I will bro
614 episodes no reason to stop so I will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep rocking and rolling thank you for the
encouragement says I do have another
[SPEAKER_00]: question for you I know in flower most
people do say that day one is when they
[SPEAKER_00]: switch to 1212 so that is it says most
people I'm going to say that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: general rule of thumb when it comes to
growing cannabis we switch to 1212 that is
[SPEAKER_00]: day one of the flowering cycle a lot of
people say do I wait until I see pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: do I wait until that no you're in control
that is your grow room you decide that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the day one of flower the day you
flip that plant that light cycle to 1212
[SPEAKER_00]: so as a breeder I'm putting on my packages
these seeds will take nine to eleven weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower that starts the day you flip the
lights that is what I'm talking about so
[SPEAKER_00]: you should follow the guy who made the
seed packages and the standard that way
[SPEAKER_00]: you should follow our advice in my opinion
maybe I'm not the king or the authority or
[SPEAKER_00]: something but I would recommend you follow
the breeders advice since we put the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation on the seeds we made yeah
but then again a lot of breeders I could
[SPEAKER_00]: be guilty of this too because of
phenotypes and grow rooms and shit but a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people will tell you this will
finish in four weeks just so that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: buy it you know what I mean but still try
to take that breeders recommendation and
[SPEAKER_00]: it does start on the day you flip to 1212
not when you see pistols not when you see
[SPEAKER_00]: pre flowers not when the buds are setting
not when the trichomes pop up it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: day you change the timer so I know in
flower most people say day one is when we
[SPEAKER_00]: switch to 1212 I'm gonna say that that is
when all people should say that they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to flowers but when does vegetative growth
start from what I've read it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: most people veg for about four weeks but
what is officially day one of veg is it
[SPEAKER_00]: the day the sprouts pop up out of the
ground I would say that's the seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: stage you have to go through seedling then
you go through veg actually I do two
[SPEAKER_00]: different veg stages we'll touch on that
in a moment or is it after two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes grow or when also should day one of
veg be the first feeding or should I wait
[SPEAKER_00]: or have already started feeding them
thanks for your help that's gonna play
[SPEAKER_00]: into part of what I was talking about a
second ago with two different sizes of veg
[SPEAKER_00]: so the seedling phase until you've got
like some true leaves some real growth
[SPEAKER_00]: going on then I would just say you're in a
seedling stage once you've got a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are confident in that you think
is so it's just like taking home a little
[SPEAKER_00]: baby when you take home a brand new baby
for that first week or so you were just
[SPEAKER_00]: checking it just randomly because it's not
going to I don't mean to scare anybody out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that's got a new baby but when
you're a new parent you're just checking
[SPEAKER_00]: on the baby is it breathing it did it die
like you're just fucking freaked out so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like that with a new baby plant
also right once that like feeling of oh
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to live I've actually got this
plant I'm going to say that that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're officially out of the seedling
stage and in a veg stage for most people
[SPEAKER_00]: most people may live in that fucking
freaked out isn't going to survive stage
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole entire time excuse me but once
it's got its first set of true leaves not
[SPEAKER_00]: those little shit leaves that grow little
tiny ones not those little weak ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: pop out at first but that true set of
serrated leaves with all of the fingers on
[SPEAKER_00]: it that's when I'm gonna say you were
officially in veg now that is my opinion I
[SPEAKER_00]: run a commercial grow I get to decide when
day one of veg is and when seedling phase
[SPEAKER_00]: ends and when so another thing I want to
talk about is I run two different veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phases so I start with I generally don't
start with the seedling in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow I'll start with the clone so let's
just hypothetically say we go from
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling phase that's probably about two
weeks or so depending on your environment
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of lights you're using how
vigorous your seeds are it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: about two two and a half maybe three weeks
of seedling stage then we are in what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would do is small veg that's when I'm
using either a four inch nursery pot maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a four or six inch net pot those are my
small veg plants they get fed a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter of a mix I'm more focused on roots
and just establishing a plant getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: root nice and healthy and getting it going
I'm working on feeding it NPK microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes mostly things to get like
lightning start and recharge things to get
[SPEAKER_00]: those roots really going shebang then I
transplant into a depending on where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: at what I'm doing sometimes a two
sometimes a three sometimes a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot at this point I am in what I call
large veg so I've gone from my clone phase
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a two week phase in the cloner
that goes into my four inch net pot or my
[SPEAKER_00]: four inch nursery or my six inch net pot
or I had my cloning phase which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: about two weeks the same amount of time as
my cloning phase that I say clone my
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling phase I'm not sure what I'm
saying I'm trying to say all this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fly I've got minimal notes you guys I hope
you know this is all coming out of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of my head I've got a two week either veg
or seedling phase then I go into a small
[SPEAKER_00]: veg phase in a four or six inch maybe an
eight inch pot then I go into my one three
[SPEAKER_00]: or five gallon pot depending on the
environment the grow that I'm working in
[SPEAKER_00]: the personal grow commercial grow
greenhouse grow depends on where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going that is when I consider myself in
large veg that's when I'll kind of refocus
[SPEAKER_00]: my feeding regimen to go more toward
developing shoots and branches more
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth instead of focusing so
much on the roots we're still feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes were filled still feeding things
to feed the roots encourage root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm more focused on getting nitrogen
into the plant get it vigorous get it big
[SPEAKER_00]: get a happy sort of getting it shaped for
the flowering phase so I don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is an official day when veg starts I
say that it's when those real true leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: pop out and you've got a fucking plant
that looks like a plant that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoid you don't have a little newborn
that you're cuddling in a little blanket
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when I think we have actually got
plants that are entering the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: phase so when they've got those first real
fan leaves is when I say so the best part
[SPEAKER_00]: about running your own commercial grow is
that sort of stuff is up to you or your
[SPEAKER_00]: own personal grow that stuff is up to you
you get to make your own schedules your
[SPEAKER_00]: own cycles your own flows your own
standard operating procedures these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are very versatile very flexible they are
adaptable they can grow your way you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no one way to grow it as long as
we give it a veg cycle and a flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle and we dry it and cure it properly
most of the time we're going to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: with a usable product it's all about those
details in the middle that dictate quality
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no hard and fast rule set by
day one of veg is this day unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a commercial environment and you've
written that SOP and then you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide that day one officially is this day
I keep saying it I think it's when those
[SPEAKER_00]: true leaves first start popping out now
you can start feeding it before that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can feed it very lightly before that
they've got enough energy to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: going probably 14 days if you're gonna go
a little bit longer before you put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: a bigger pot or something definitely feed
it give it a little bit of nitrogen focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on building solid roots something like
lightning start maybe a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: recharge in there or the equivalent is
always a good idea maybe some mammoth pee
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make it go shebang and get it
started but I don't know that there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: official a book a rule a referee that
tells us when official day one of veg is
[SPEAKER_00]: so you get to kind of decide that on your
own you guys excuse me for the throat
[SPEAKER_00]: clearing I'm gonna just take a drink here
let's fix this right quick
[SPEAKER_00]: once again I'm sipping on that newt sense
pineapple and what is that pineapple and
[SPEAKER_00]: coconut juice and it is divine oh I could
just chug that whole cup and just one good
[SPEAKER_00]: fat drink there all right my friend
squirrel master I hope I answered your
[SPEAKER_00]: question like I said there's no hard fast
rule basically when you get your first
[SPEAKER_00]: true leaves that is when you have entered
the vegetative stage then you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide how long you want a veg I do about
14 days in the clone or seedling stage two
[SPEAKER_00]: to three maybe four weeks in a small pot
and then like five to maybe six weeks in a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pot I got about a nine week
vegetative stage a nine week flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage it works out real well but it's kind
of up to you but I feel like I got off on
[SPEAKER_00]: a long ramble on that one so let's jump
into another email that will keep me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more focus this one came from
our friend they want their name said it
[SPEAKER_00]: says trolling nobody knows who trolling is
what I'm trolling and it's not trolling
[SPEAKER_00]: with an I and it's trolling t-r-o-l-a-n a
little bit different than trolling
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of vibe going on there no
trolling but all trolling anyway the
[SPEAKER_00]: message goes hey RJ I love the podcast and
the community you are creating thank you I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that shout out to the iry army
and thank you for being a big part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: community it says easily one of the best
and most inviting cannabis communities
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in the last six years of using
cannabis for my service connected
[SPEAKER_00]: disabilities hey I owe you a big thank you
for your service thank you we do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that it goes on to say you've
helped me grow much better than before and
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot thank you enough you've earned my
support and then some thank you that means
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot to me I'm glad to help you out in
the garden hearing that I am making
[SPEAKER_00]: people's gardens better that's what I'm
here for so that means a lot and just
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing that you guys recognize that we
are kind of forming a community here that
[SPEAKER_00]: the iry genetics that the grow from your
heart podcast all the stuff I do is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: part of a community we've got a nice
little crew the iry army the other people
[SPEAKER_00]: that hang out you guys are awesome so
thank you and thank you for noticing that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to kind of cultivate a little
bit of a community here I understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: I accidentally became some kind of a
community leader I do my best to embrace
[SPEAKER_00]: that role it goes on to say I especially
liked your latest podcast talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis education I had a follow-up
question I'm currently going to school to
[SPEAKER_00]: change careers into software engineering
and programming oh man that's that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me a headache so I'm glad you are
doing it it says I'll graduate in three
[SPEAKER_00]: years and I'm increasingly drawn to the
agriculture technology side of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: like grow software and control what or
where would you recommend to start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the nerdy side of cultivation
I'm currently in Northern California but
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely curious of all of my options I
love seeing the quality of your show
[SPEAKER_00]: increase with all the love you're getting
and deserve take care from our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: troll and it's rolling first of all thanks
again for the great compliments and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of you for going to school for
software engineering and programming that
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds intimidating to me you'll graduate
in three years that's awesome that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a plan my friend now you want to know
where we can get you in in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry the cannabis industry like all
horticulture all cultivation industries
[SPEAKER_00]: are rapidly evolving I know you want to
maybe do things like some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation stuff like tracking or
something like that I really like what
[SPEAKER_00]: Pete is doing shout out to my buddy Pete
from PNL grow also shout out to PL grow
[SPEAKER_00]: systems check out their updated website
big up to my friends at PL grow he does a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where he can take photos of plants
with an infrared camera and identify plant
[SPEAKER_00]: issues before the human eye can even see
it he is developing a database of photos
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help us identify plant issues by
just taking a picture of our plant it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: say oh you've basically got this there are
a lot of great technology options in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis realm however what I think is
really practical and that I think we are
[SPEAKER_00]: really lacking in a lot of existing and
upcoming markets are opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing testing has become widely popular
in the markets where it is available but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not available to everybody yet in the
cannabis industry whether it's commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: personal growing whatever if it's the
caregiver model if it's the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow there's not enough testing available
people can get if you run a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation you can get your product
tested for terpenes for potency for mold
[SPEAKER_00]: for yeast for contaminants for heavy
metals but in Colorado if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow you cannot get your product
tested for anything so one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: things I would like to see is more
available of testing part of that reason
[SPEAKER_00]: is logistics and legalities they kind of
cock-blocked us on testing here because of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalities but in new markets you can work
that into the new recreational and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: rules when you make that that you can have
a testing facility available for the home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower that is something I think we need
potency testing THC CBD CBN CBG THC V and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever new cannabinoid is popular this
week and by the time you listen to this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast we should be testing for all of
that stuff everybody should have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: that also I think we should have access to
terpene testing we should be able to test
[SPEAKER_00]: our flowers and concentrates for terpenes
we should also be able to test them like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said a moment ago for contaminants mold
mildew pathogens problems also for
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and heavy metals I'd like to
see that sort of stuff widely available
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you could develop something for the
home grower that they can do it at home
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we can submit a sample anything at
home and drop it off to you and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: already just ready all you got to do is
shake it or something you guys could do
[SPEAKER_00]: your job really quickly maybe you can
offer something like that also a testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for presence of cannabinoid precursors I
had to take a little drink that I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize for that let me jump back right
where I was another thing we could use is
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing labs that can show us the
presence of precursors for cannabinoids it
[SPEAKER_00]: is very useful as a breeder to be able to
take a sample of plant tissue send it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab and they can tell me that these
samples of plants are high in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors and this batch of plants isn't
really testing high in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors we can remove the low testers
from the batch and we can actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding based on the predicated testing
from the presence of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors and move forward with those
high testing plants and not waste our time
[SPEAKER_00]: with the low testing plants if our goal is
to breed for high THC so that's another
[SPEAKER_00]: lab I would love to see another thing I
would love to see is something like gene
[SPEAKER_00]: verification I don't know if there's a
market for this other than my desire but I
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to be able to I have created
some strains so maybe I could send you a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of samples of a rise maybe a couple
of samples of strawberry starburst maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: morning dew sample and then you could take
those samples and gene sequence them and
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in a database and have standard
samples of real tested genetics that way
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a real database of real tested
genetics there was another company doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it I've looked a lot at what they have
posted it seems like a lot of their
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics their database is a little bit
convoluted there was no way to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody from sending a fake sample in
there I don't know how reliable that
[SPEAKER_00]: database has become some of it is
questionable to me but to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a breeder based gene verification
database would be really cool in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion like only the people that are
breeding these strains or people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: been vetted or something people with a
reputation people that you know and can
[SPEAKER_00]: rely on people that have been vetted
that's what I'm trying to say people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been auditioned and gone through an
application process can actually send you
[SPEAKER_00]: in tissue sample and get these plants into
a database that is something I would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to see then in the future if somebody's
got a clone in like five years and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like bro I got the grateful dog you'd be
like I don't know if you really do just
[SPEAKER_00]: send a sample of it to you and they'll go
oh man you really do have the grateful dog
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're full of shit that is not the
grateful dog that's actually just this you
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually tell them what it is if
you've got a sample of that I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds crazy that could be just a dream
but there's something in there that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be viable for all growers some sort of
gene verification would be really cool and
[SPEAKER_00]: we just got to be sure not to let that get
corrupted because that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like happened last time they were
allowing random samples in there the
[SPEAKER_00]: samples were just convoluted the database
got convoluted then also the company
[SPEAKER_00]: seemed to use our data the data they
collected for unscrupulous activity maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the definition of it I'm trying to stay
out all that right now and not get
[SPEAKER_00]: political on that bullshit but we could
use a new company that does that with
[SPEAKER_00]: better interests is kind of what I'm
thinking I want to say in agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: technology there are so many people and so
many things doing agricultural technology
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think the testing labs are what I
desire the most tracking is done well seed
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell points are covered quite well
pesticides application and stuff is done
[SPEAKER_00]: quite well I'm not sure honestly as a guy
who's been growing before all this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology took over until it gets to
giant scale cultivation I think we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get back to our roots a little bit and
stop paying so much attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: meters and the technology don't get me
wrong in a big cultivation I love all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the data that I can get that is great for
the lead grower for upper management for
[SPEAKER_00]: the consultants but as grotesque and home
growers I think most of those folks need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get away from all of the machines and
devices and watch the plants I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing I don't need as many devices
because I can look at the plants have you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen a guitar player get up on stage
and if he doesn't need a guitar tuner
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't he just look like that much more
of a badass the guy that needs a guitar
[SPEAKER_00]: tuner you're like oh you can't tune by ear
bro come on how long you've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this I feel like I can tune the plants by
ear I can just look at them and I can say
[SPEAKER_00]: oh this because I haven't been relying on
all this amazing impressive technology I
[SPEAKER_00]: do use the technology to my advantage
don't get me wrong I love the gear I love
[SPEAKER_00]: the toys they are great I use them second
I find too many growers using the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment the technology the toys the
meters the gadgets first and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: always on their phone checking to see
what's wrong with their grow when I go put
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone away bro let's go in the grow
room and look at the plants and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: is wrong with those plants I use the
plants first as my first guide my judgment
[SPEAKER_00]: my indicator they're gonna tell me what's
wrong before the meter like maybe one day
[SPEAKER_00]: your meter will beep and something will go
bro it's too hot in here that's cool but
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time I can look at the plants
and they go it's too hot in here it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: cold in here also have you ever thought
about just reaching out and touching the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants if you think it might be cold in
the grow room it's a cold season right now
[SPEAKER_00]: if you think maybe the plants are cold
touch them just reach out and put your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand on them just touch them just like yo
mama used to do and be like oh you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweater you could do that to the plants
just touch the plants see if their cheeks
[SPEAKER_00]: are cold put your hands right around them
they're yours you could touch them you
[SPEAKER_00]: could squeeze them violate them all you
want anyway I do love all the technology I
[SPEAKER_00]: love seeing you guys advance all the
technology and the toys and stuff in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow environment but let's not forget that
we've been growing these plants way way
[SPEAKER_00]: way before we had all this technology some
of the most amazing cannabis I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: grown came from just a very basic archaic
almost basement grow with lights and fans
[SPEAKER_00]: and an air conditioner and the dude that
grew it at the time had no idea that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a way to set all this shit up with the
internet and use all these monitors so I
[SPEAKER_00]: do appreciate your desire to be in the
agricultural technology side of cannabis I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think I gave you the details you
want because you are in the software
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering and you want to do software
and control and I recommended testing but
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly that is what I see is needed the
most right now at this time a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff is well covered there are so
many companies making VPD monitors and co2
[SPEAKER_00]: monitors and notification systems tracking
systems weight systems data entry and data
[SPEAKER_00]: logging systems a lot of that stuff is
taken up but we do need more labs in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion all right trolling I do want to
thank you for the great question I wish I
[SPEAKER_00]: had a better answer for you I do want to
thank you once again for your service I
[SPEAKER_00]: also want to wish you the best of luck in
your education I hope you reach all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your goals in the next three years then I
hope the next five to ten years are
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking amazing because of the amazing
education you've got I hope you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful amazing career ahead of you
