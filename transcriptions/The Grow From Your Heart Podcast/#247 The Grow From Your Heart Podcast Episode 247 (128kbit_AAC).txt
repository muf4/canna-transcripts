[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 247 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, welcome to the show,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am coming to you on a rainy Thursday
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been raining in Southern Colorado
for several days now, and it does not show
[SPEAKER_01]: any sign of letting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got an outdoor crop in Southern
Colorado, you are working for your money
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not going to be a simple grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of folks are going to get powdered
debris, mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of folks are going to get bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of crops are just going to get
simply destroyed by the hail, by the rain,
[SPEAKER_01]: by all the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everything goes well for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are an outdoor grower in Southern
Colorado, I send my love and my respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everything goes your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an outdoor grower anywhere,
I send love and respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people in Colorado are getting a
damn challenge this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be a shortage in cannabis
available at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may not get the harvests we are
anticipating from the outdoor grows
[SPEAKER_01]: because of all this fucked up weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it doesn't ruin anybody's Christmas
plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I start the show, I usually like to
talk about what I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am dabbing on some Stardog
Dubwise that I picked up from Three
[SPEAKER_01]: Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, I am the lead
cultivator, the grow manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the dude over at Three Rivers
Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run that grow over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to smoke some concentrates that was
grown in my garden by myself and my grow
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts a little smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Stardog Dubwise is a great combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, of course, was extracted by our
friends at Concentrate Supply Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do like three retakes on the damn
intro because of this shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how high I got from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me a little bit goofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently, it's got me a little bit
rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to my friends at Concentrate
Supply Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work with the material we gave you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably old news by the time this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yesterday, Mr. Hugh Hefner passed
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mr. Hugh Hefner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The man behind Playboy magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're just reading the articles,
I'm sure everyone has taken a peek into a
[SPEAKER_01]: Playboy magazine and found something that
got their attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't just dirty pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, there were jokes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorite jokes were from old
Playboy magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I just thought of one as I was
saying that there was a picture of a guy
[SPEAKER_01]: in a Batman costume and a beautiful girl
who looked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was an animation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from when I was a little kid
is when I discovered this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a man in a Batman costume,
and he had his wing her out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a woman next to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was really pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was sitting on the bed with a
really disappointed look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the caption said, What did you expect?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bat dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might have been the first meme.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may have been a meme back in the day
before memes were memes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyhow, shout out to Mr. Hugh Hefner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said that Hugh Hefner has gone on
to a better place that he is in heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you fucking sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're Hugh Hefner, what's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is better than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is heaven?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move forward a little bit
with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, let's get serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of great emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn this music down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to get right into the
first email of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you'd like to send me an
email to be read on the show, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way to reach me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do my best to respond to your email
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am working my way through the stack of
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I haven't gotten to yours yet,
keep listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do my best to get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some questions are seasonal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are going along with other things I'm
already thinking about talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just timing it and getting to
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Rasta Jeff, what is up my
brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: About a month and discovering your
wonderfully refreshing show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so nice to have a mix of culture,
music, laughs, and of course, growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your show sails away my day as I slave
away in the wonderful world of
[SPEAKER_01]: construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been binging on the past episodes as
well as the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not familiar, every Thursday I
put out a Throwback Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am at episode 247.
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100 episodes
in most feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 147 episodes are not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been putting those in chunks of like
three to five episodes and releasing those
[SPEAKER_01]: on Thursdays so that the old episodes are
back in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get caught up, I'll just stop doing
the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I am putting all of the old
episodes up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube does not limit how much content I
provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get every episode up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out the Throwback
Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the old stuff will be archived
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for listening to the Thursday
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know people are listening
because that takes a lot of time to put
[SPEAKER_01]: together a three hour episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes on to say, your knowledge
as well as the many guests from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis culture can impart much
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that reason, I need a little advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little background on myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the south, prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife and I are very progressive
thinkers, use cannabis regularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: mildly successful, parents most of all,
and we plan on heading west within the
[SPEAKER_01]: next couple of years to relocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: My home will likely be one of the last
states to show any progression towards
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, my heart is just
simply in the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my dream to better this culture and
one day contribute in some meaningful
[SPEAKER_01]: manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my family is planning on liquidating
our assets here, supplant where the laws
[SPEAKER_01]: are more favorable and restart our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, the biggest part of this
decision is the desire to experience a
[SPEAKER_01]: culture that is more like my own ideals,
as well as raise my children in a place
[SPEAKER_01]: with open minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on using my professional experience
to gain employment in our new home and
[SPEAKER_01]: then attempt to enter the cannabis
industry any way I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you decide to pack up and leave,
make sure you can get an MED badge in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state of Colorado before you even consider
coming here because if you cannot get
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you cannot work in the college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your background, I'm just
giving you a heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me find my spot in the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, at least that way I can support
my family and not be unrealistic in the
[SPEAKER_01]: time it takes to get into the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I digress, that is where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to give any advice on that
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, so far sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna go somewhere where you can
freely use cannabis, where you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to hide your cannabis, you don't have to
be a criminal because of a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: of a thing that you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it, I encourage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you have to look for before
you do it is make sure you can get that
[SPEAKER_01]: badge, don't move out here with hopes of
getting into the industry and not being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get that badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you have other employment
options which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe find an ancillary business or
something to align yourself with and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can work yourself into the industry
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the question I have is about
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I explain all of this craziness to
them when anti-weed propaganda is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from every direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: My pre-teen point blank asked my wife and
I if we smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happened just the other night.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife and I were flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that kids at school and Dare had
explained all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stated that all of his knowledge was
negative regarding the matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He suspected that we do, we do yes,
but we are very discreet considering the
[SPEAKER_01]: laws in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kids are my everything, so I was
morally conflicted with this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal, so I wanted to say no,
but my home is an open door policy and he
[SPEAKER_01]: is growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife and I explained that we use
cannabis for medical reasons and that we
[SPEAKER_01]: plan on moving to an area that poses no
legal issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is very smart and a wonderful child.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been reading at a high school level
since third grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stated that he had concerns for our
health and legal ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I explained that this conversation was
much too adult oriented to discuss at the
[SPEAKER_01]: current moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says in parentheses, had to buy time to
research, which is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some research before you talk to the
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes on to say, I explained the
importance of keeping this discussion in
[SPEAKER_01]: our home only and if this information were
to leak, that it could very well
[SPEAKER_01]: jeopardize our family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him that if he gained my trust by
being mature about this serious topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we would explain cannabis more in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need help, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any advice?
[SPEAKER_01]: They sign the email with, please keep me
anonymous and they go on to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a fat dab for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugs all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, before I dish out any advice,
I want to say good job and great
[SPEAKER_01]: parenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You handled that perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure by what you said in the email
that you understand this, but I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stress to everybody in the situation and
anybody listening how important it is that
[SPEAKER_01]: this information stays in your home,
that your child does not mention your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use to anybody at school,
to anybody outside of the home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to stress that to the child.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you already have, but that is one
of the most important things right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are super correct with if this
information leak, it could very well
[SPEAKER_01]: jeopardize your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain to your child that they will take
your child away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your child could possibly be put in foster
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will cause tons of problems for years
down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll disrupt schooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll disrupt home life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll disrupt their future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will disrupt your future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll disrupt your careers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll disrupt your finances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that child understands how
crucial it is that this is a family
[SPEAKER_01]: secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even here in Colorado, we have problems
with child protective services or the
[SPEAKER_01]: equivalent trying to interfere in cannabis
patient's lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel that the child, there's a grow
in a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel that the child is involved in
the grow and they try to get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with cannabis for
medicinal uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with having a small
medical grow or a personal grow in your
[SPEAKER_01]: home where your child lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep the child out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep the child safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason for CPS to be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason for authorities to be
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that your children know that
this is a family secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you understand how important it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to stress to anybody out there
in any illegal state, DARE is trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: program your children to snitch on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be time for all of you to talk to
your kids about you and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking lie to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they know the truth, they know why they
can't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what's going on, then it's not a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's a secret, that's when shit is a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's out in the open on the table,
the kids don't care anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been mostly open since my daughter's
been old enough to talk about things and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been open, wide open about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my daughter has any questions about
cannabis, if my daughter has questions
[SPEAKER_01]: about anything, she knows that she can
come to me and we can talk about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that builds a stronger
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: If she is afraid to talk to me about
something or if I keep secrets from her,
[SPEAKER_01]: then she feels like she needs to keep
secrets from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not just have an open door policy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I can explain the truths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can dispel myths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell her what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell her what to avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems much wiser to me to tell the kids
the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way when DARE comes along and they're
trying to trick your kids into snitching
[SPEAKER_01]: on you, your kids are on your team and
they already know, hey, dad coached me,
[SPEAKER_01]: mom coached me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said these fuckers were going to come
in and ask if my mom had any weird
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling shit around the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've lied to the kids and you've been
hiding it, chances are they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom does do some weird sketchy shit
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when Ellen comes on, she makes me go
in the other room and play with my toys
[SPEAKER_01]: and I smell this really weird funky shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I come out and she's watching
Ellen eating popcorn with a stupid fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: smile on her face.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kids aren't as stupid as we want to
think they are, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kids are paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell them the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You communicate with them before the
fuckers in DARE, before the fuckers at
[SPEAKER_01]: school, before somebody else gets it out
of them and uses it against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know you're trying to be a good
parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can consume cannabis and still be a
great parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis consumption does not make you a
bad parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell that anybody that would
take the time to send me an email to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a great parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are on the right path.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got faith in your parenting skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing shit correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell that kid the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a couple of things I want to talk
about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that the child is concerned about
your health because of things that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably heard in school.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell you that cannabis kills brain
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell you that cannabis gives you
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's time to sit down with your
child and pull up some YouTube videos of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are suffering from extreme
medical conditions, obvious blatant
[SPEAKER_01]: medical conditions, and watch them consume
a little bit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let the kids watch how that little
bit of cannabis consumption repairs these
[SPEAKER_01]: people, how it lets them enjoy life,
how it makes their seizures go away,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it makes their palsy go away,
how it makes their tics and twitches go
[SPEAKER_01]: away, or how it just improves the quality
of their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure just a quick Google search or a
quick YouTube search of medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: patient finds relief or something along
that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you could find a bunch of videos
of people consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there are people having
seizures where people rub cannabis on
[SPEAKER_01]: their feet and they stop having seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video of a guy having a full on
palsy fit or he's practically smacking
[SPEAKER_01]: himself in the face because he's got no
control of his hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: His friend lights a pipe and puts it to
his mouth and he smokes off the pipe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and the palsy stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could find that video, that may be
helpful for the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason they have fear for your medical
safety, for your health, is because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been programmed to think that that
is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to tell them the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been lied to so much that they
believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the same conditioning that the
old people, that the generation before us,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were lied to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were told that cannabis will ruin
your brain, that it will cause all these
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still using the same scare tactics
and the same methods and techniques that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've used since our grandparents were
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've just got to tell them the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth is the answer, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you said your child's next concern was
legal ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a smart child there that
emphasized to that child that that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: to be your secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if that gets out of the house,
that's when the legal ramifications kick
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the herb there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going anywhere with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the best of my knowledge, you're not
growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just consuming a little bit of
cannabis for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not get the law involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you guys stay quiet about it
and stay adults about it, there will be no
[SPEAKER_01]: legal ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the age level of your
child and how much they can comprehend,
[SPEAKER_01]: this could be an opening for a lot of
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk about how cannabis is legal
in some places and not in others,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's legal medically in some places
and how it's available recreationally in
[SPEAKER_01]: some places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can also teach your child about
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only cannabis prohibition,
the history of alcohol prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that will spark conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversations about history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll spark conversations about America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will spark conversations about
rules and government control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll just, it'll spark so much
conversation and you will get to interact
[SPEAKER_01]: with that child and kind of shape their
mind a little bit more and open their eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: to a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way the government works, the way the
systems work, the way that I feel like the
[SPEAKER_01]: government tries to control the people a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're pro, if they're prohibiting us
from consuming a plant that makes us feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better, they are controlling us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can open the child's eyes to that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're old enough, I'm not sure how
old your children are, but it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: doorways for a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think conversation with kids is
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you shape them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you make them great adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice again is to tell the youths the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon lies to the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: TV lies to the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cartoons lies to the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody out on the street lie to the
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the billboards and advertising lies to
the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kids lie to each other to build each
other's egos and to try to be cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's got to tell the kids the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your job as a parent to
straighten them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's weird, awkward shit,
sometimes you got to tell the kids the
[SPEAKER_01]: truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never claimed to be super dad or have
a parenting podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I said something you don't agree
with anybody out there, I would love an
[SPEAKER_01]: email in response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like your input on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody out there, either email me or
send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how you teach your kids
about your cannabis use, how you handle
[SPEAKER_01]: your cannabis use with your children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a secret?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that's open?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you talked to them about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you message me, also include your
location so that I can know if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: an illegal area or if you're in a state
that allows cannabis use recreationally
[SPEAKER_01]: and or medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to learn so that I can help more
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that sent me that email asked
that I do not include their name,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to give them a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the great content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you so much for being a great
parent and trying to do the right thing
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says, Rasta Jeff, I've been
listening to your podcast since I started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell everyone I can about it and I try
to promote your vast wealth of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your show and can't believe the
info you share without substantial charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was hoping you could point me in
the direction of a podcast that you cover,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud Rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here it is, dude, because I haven't
done a podcast about Bud Rot before this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be the episode and I hope
you're listening to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes on and says, it seems the
larger and more Bud sites I produce
[SPEAKER_01]: through topping and etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: increases my chance for Bud Rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to know how to avoid this
frustrating problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an order coming from the dank team
to run your genetics and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck it up near the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also curious if you will be releasing any
FEM seeds anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I'll run into you one day at
higher elevations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your fan, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious which of my strains you
selected from the dank team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to remind everybody, since you
brought it up, thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for regular or feminized
seeds, I highly recommend thedankteam.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: the D-A-N-K, the dank, thedankteam.com,
home of the dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got regular, they've got feminized
seeds, they've got seeds for a mile high,
[SPEAKER_01]: can of venture, rare dankness,
irie genetics, sin city, sour seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carry all kinds of breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for seeds, they've got
what you're looking for there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I recommend irie genetics
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I create those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need some seeds, go get yourself
some irie genetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very reliable, high quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there are no feminized
seeds available on the website from irie
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question this guy said was curious
if you'll be releasing any FEM seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with this arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making a bunch of fun crosses with
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got arise F2s for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on making arise F3s pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got stuff lined up, stuff in the
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be searching out a new male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not telling anybody what that male
will be, but I'm selecting for a new male
[SPEAKER_01]: to open up my breeding a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go a little more indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my stuff is really heavy sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put some indica into my lineup,
but I do not see myself making any
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds until at least after I do
an indica dominant breeding run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there may be some feminized seeds
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I do make FEM seeds, it's going to
be quite a while, at least a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to disappoint you, but thanks for
the interest in FEM seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of other breeders that
are putting out FEM seeds online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably get plenty of great FEM
seeds on thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk more about the topic of your
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're worried about bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you've experienced bud rot
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I predict that a lot of outdoor growers
are going to experience a lot of bud rot
[SPEAKER_01]: this year because of the moisture,
stagnant air, humidity, and giant buds are
[SPEAKER_01]: your cause of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about bud rot for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever been breaking up a bud,
like a long bud with more than two,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you've got a cola, it's got like two
or three buds around the stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could break off one little bud and
that probably packs a bowl, you break off
[SPEAKER_01]: another little bud, that'll pack a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll pull off those little
nugs off the big stick and you'll see like
[SPEAKER_01]: a gray or white or light brown
discoloration on the bottom side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is either the start of bud mold or
bud mold itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts off kind of like this brown hint
and then it turns this white color and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it turns fuzzy and then it gets
furry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then honestly, it looks like a spider
egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever seen spider eggs,
those fuzzy white balls, it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: that is growing on the inside of your bud
and it will take over the inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot see it while the bud's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take photos of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds will look fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you cut it and you start to get
inside of it and you see this funky shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even describe the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of anything that smells like
that other than bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it will, I said you can't
see it on the buds when they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is just ignored and it gets extreme,
it will grow to the outside of the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will just look like brown shit coming
out of your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just moldy, brown, sludgy, funky shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it looks like white,
just dandelions just growing out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on the conditions and
where the mold started and how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will change colors and it will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is non-consumable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got bud rot on your buds,
throw that shit away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not trade it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either put it in the compost bin
and compost it or you can put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trash and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't make extracts out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly do not make fucking edibles out
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moldy bud is only good for trash or
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you know what bud rot looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a Q-tip growing out of your
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks like hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what causes that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What causes bud rot is mainly humidity
inside of the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got too much humidity during
your day cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got too much humidity during
your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got a big swing in temps and
humidity from your day to your night
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things that will encourage bud
rot or boy tritus to grow within your
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably find the bud mold starting
either in a giant top cola or you'll find
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a lower part that doesn't get a lot
of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light kind of prevents it,
kind of kills a little bit, but those
[SPEAKER_01]: lower shaded areas are definitely going to
be prime targets for gray mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: for bud mold, for boy tritus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually humidity and low light are what
are going to cause your gray mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you probably have too much humidity in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get that humidity down to under 50%
during your flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got too much humidity,
you're going to start causing mold and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see any yellowing or dead or dying
leaves, get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see bud mold forming,
there's not really a lot you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either cut out the section where
it's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try to treat the plants with a
fungicide, something like cease or double
[SPEAKER_01]: nickel, or probably serinate or something
like that would work, but there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: really a lot you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes messing with mold and disturbing
mold spores and cutting that shit down
[SPEAKER_01]: will just bounce it around the grove and
it's going to get on your clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I should mention and should
certainly recommend when you are working
[SPEAKER_01]: with plants that have boy tritus or gray
mold or bud mold or any sort of mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you work with that plant, clean your
scissors with alcohol before you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should always be keeping your scissors
and your tools clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just scrub your scissors occasionally with
alcohol, keep everything clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: change your gloves frequently,
especially if you see some mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I would do is add some
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about dehumidification about
ventilation and ventilating your grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: on this show a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do not realize how
important it is to evacuate old air and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to exchange the air in that grow
room frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be contributing to your bud
rot, to your mold problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to get that old musty air out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to lower the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put some fans in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that every leaf in that room,
it doesn't need to be bouncing around
[SPEAKER_01]: really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs a little rustle
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan can sweep from right to left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rustle all those leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can rest and then it'll come back and
sweep left to right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rustle those leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that those leaves get moved
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll just move airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more airflow, the less chances for
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just when the mold, the water and the
air sit there inside those buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds are like big sponges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got these big sponges and it gets
humid in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That moisture goes inside the bud or it
gets hot and that bud starts sweating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got moisture inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the lights go off and it gets cool in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got the perfect environment
to create mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just think about how you're creating
the mold or the moisture is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What climate is causing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to correct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you probably have too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get that humidity out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you overwatering the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a hydro grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your reservoir in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what type of grow you've got,
but those are a few things you could think
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got excessive water in the room
for any reason, get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the res is in the room, put that on the
other side of the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever water is left in the tray after
you're watering, make sure you vacuum that
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get all the extra water out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plants aren't showing any signs of
needing water, maybe wait another day to
[SPEAKER_01]: water so you can get some of that air out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got that much humidity that's
causing you bud rot, there's too much
[SPEAKER_01]: water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're overwatering the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in your grow and I haven't seen
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't tell you exactly what's causing
it, but it is too much humidity and not
[SPEAKER_01]: enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that does suck that will
contribute to bud rot is too big of a bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, you've got a big giant bud
that acts as a sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a bunch of humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that humidity gathers in that bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes dark during your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cools off just a little bit because you
don't have those lights in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes the perfect condition for
powdery mildew to start happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes the perfect condition for boy
tritus, for bud molds, for all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: funky shit to start happening in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that just crossed my mind
that could be contributing to your
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, sprays, foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you spraying right before the lights
go out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you are creating mad humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are creating the perfect conditions
for bud mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're spraying right when the
lights go out, you may need to work on
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn the lights off, spray, wait a little
bit before you close up the room because
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get some air in and out of
that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get that moisture out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe spray an hour earlier so that you
can leave the doors open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the grow lights on in
there, but you've got the doors open so
[SPEAKER_01]: that the air can flow around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get rid of all that humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when the lights are supposed to go
off, go in there and correct your timer so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it goes off and on like it's supposed
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the next cycle and then close up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be dark in there like you need
it for the post spray conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're spraying right before the
lights go out, you may be contributing to
[SPEAKER_01]: the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your sprays may be contributing to your
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you've got gigantic buds
and a whole bunch of them, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a lot of water in there,
which means it's probably too humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dehumidifier, more fans, less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is probably the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Mike, I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank you for listening to
the podcast and for telling everyone and
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting my vast wealth of cannabis
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, this show will always be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said thanks for giving out the show
without a substantial charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast will always be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from my heart to your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I save one person's garden every week
with my podcast, then it is worth my time
[SPEAKER_01]: and energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get to harvest your crop that you
would not have gotten to harvest without
[SPEAKER_01]: my guidance, it was well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I want to thank both
of my emailers for sending me messages and
[SPEAKER_01]: asking great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if you've got a question you'd
like to ask me, I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get through all of these emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to answer as many as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to wrap up
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate it if you follow me on
all of the social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're into Facebook, you can find me
on Facebook, search for the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Instagram, I use my seed company
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Iri, underscore, genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you check me out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier, I mentioned that there are
episodes up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to YouTube and search for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, you will
[SPEAKER_01]: find the first 99-ish episodes up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope by the time this comes out,
I've got number 99 up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will find about 99 old episodes of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will continue putting those up until I'm
caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does take a little bit of effort to
make a YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ties up my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: For whatever the video length is,
if the podcast was 30 minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to free up my computer for
approximately three times that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to build the video, and then
uploading it to YouTube takes quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am getting them all up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, I'll have all 250,
and then by then I'll have 300 episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: out, so I'll still be struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm doing my best, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sticking with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for supporting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, speaking of support, let me teach
you guys about Patreon.

[SPEAKER_01]: If you felt like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks, you can send it right my
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not begging, but it does cost me a
little bit to put out a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying for a website where I host the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying for the web service that I've
got here at the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying for these little microphone
covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does cost a little bit out of my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can cover it, but if you would like to
help, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply go to Patreon.com slash Grow From
Your Heart, and all of the information
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need will be right there.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to everyone who has contributed and
does continue to contribute to the Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I greatly appreciate your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to
give me some help and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach into your pocket, here's a really
easy way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the iTunes store,
search for the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ratings and review section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type in a little review and let me know
what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, everybody has given me a five-star
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me as many stars as you feel I
deserve, and I will read your comments on
[SPEAKER_01]: a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost time to read the comments
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that about once every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are a few gems up there
that I need to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that a bunch of my listeners are
musicians or creative types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're in a band, maybe you've made
some cool music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if you want me to play your music at
the end of a podcast episode, send me an
[SPEAKER_01]: email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
and I will do my best to get your songs on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll play it when I take a dab
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll play it at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, but you guys support me
and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel it would be a good way to return
the favor by playing your music on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a musician, if you've got a
band, if you're listening right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a song you would like to hear
on my podcast to get out to a few people,
[SPEAKER_01]: send it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play it for you because you guys
show me support.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one way I can send some support
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I think that's all
I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to
Subcool, Miss Jill, and all of the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't blame the youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fool the youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't blame the youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fool the youth.
