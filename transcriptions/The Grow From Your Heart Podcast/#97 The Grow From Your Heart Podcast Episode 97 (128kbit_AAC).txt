[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 97 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting across the table for me is my good
buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you guys that don't know,
Mike is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been in the cannabis industry,
the legal cannabis industry together for
[SPEAKER_02]: close to 10 years now-ish, maybe a little
longer than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the marijuana extended the time
closer to seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently had to run the timeline,
which is why I know that number a little
[SPEAKER_03]: faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll believe you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike says we've been in this industry
together as buddies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're trimming, time kind of
stretches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've trimmed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have trimmed a lot of my herb for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike's a fellow cannabis activist,
a good friend of mine, and also a coworker
[SPEAKER_02]: over at The Spot Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I said is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ask a question or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was no need for you to respond
other than a head shake was appropriate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was just funny to watch you shake
your head and think that the people
[SPEAKER_02]: might've heard that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speak the truth, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's a coworker over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about that in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually here, let's just go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today over at The Spot Dispensary,
man, we had a great moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had the fire inspector come
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a big moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the last sign-offs we've
been waiting on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, something I was going to, before I get
too far, follow Mike on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow him there on the
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posts a lot of good news-related
articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posts a lot of great topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you can be following him,
checking out his feed, stalking him while
[SPEAKER_02]: you're listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always fun to know who you're
checking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me and then shoot me a message or
tweet and let me know you're following
[SPEAKER_03]: from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweet at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today at The Spot Dispensary,
the fire inspector, the Pueblo West Metro
[SPEAKER_02]: fire inspector showed up and we've got
these big windows.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a fire inspection and of course we
passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump right to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fucking passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to do any hesitation to
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We passed with flying colors, but here's
the great part.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got these big sliding doors that go
over some windows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our facility is set up to be a touring
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put giant glass windows between the
tour area and where the plants will be so
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plants will not become
contaminated by anything that our touring
[SPEAKER_02]: people will come in with and also they
won't be able to touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it keeps us completely compliant and
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've designed the facility to be tour
prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got these big giant windows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say they're 12 feet tall,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are big eight by 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about eight feet wide by about 12
feet tall, big ass panes of glass with
[SPEAKER_02]: gigantic, they're garage doors,
but calling them garage doors downplays
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good description, but I can't do
better, but yeah, it underplays
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly what we've got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're garage doors made by Kodak and
they are used in the dark room film
[SPEAKER_02]: developing industry and the professional
film developing industry is what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: told these doors are for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got these grow rooms and of
course, in the night cycle in the grow
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, we need a hundred percent darkness
and we need to have that whenever the
[SPEAKER_02]: timer requires that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these doors, garage style doors roll up
and down on a little button and it keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: the light out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also, maybe we're doing something
in there that we don't want you to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we can close it down for privacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the workers can work in there without
the tour seeing that little area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fire inspector came and a big part
of those doors is they're five fire
[SPEAKER_02]: safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there happens to be a fire in that grow
room, those doors will pop down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke alarm will go off when the smoke
alarm triggers a drop and those doors all
[SPEAKER_02]: drop at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the fire hopefully is contained
to that small area and we can put it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire inspector was walking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had his arms crossed trying to be
tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fire inspector has to be a brute.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has to hold his ground and be a stern
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the look on his face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wow, this is kind of a nice
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like checking it out, like,
but he was trying to not show it,
[SPEAKER_02]: holding this clip, bored in his pen,
like a tough guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he goes, what I need to see is I
want you to trip one of these fire alarms
[SPEAKER_02]: right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just picked one randomly and he goes,
and I need all of these doors to fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at each other like they're
going to fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, we tested them all day yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like fine tune this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pushes the button and it goes beep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the doors came down beautifully in
unison.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a train starting up when
they go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's like 15 of these doors that
weigh 300 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each coming down on a track and they just
all perfectly in unison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they hit the floor, there's a
little trigger that stops them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like a hydraulic that makes them just
when they stop and he uncrossed his arms
[SPEAKER_02]: and looked around and he goes,
I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sign off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we went and signed our little fire
paper thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was so great to hear him.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you impress the fire inspector,
you're doing something right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have worked really hard to
get that piece of paper signed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam was a big help that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The department of agriculture told us they
were impressed because we are doing what
[SPEAKER_02]: other people said is not possible for a
grow facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people can't seem to catch on and
figure out how to do what Robert has done
[SPEAKER_02]: in that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: People keep asking me how long it's
getting close.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, it's getting close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you drop in the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're ever in Pueblo or Pueblo,
West Colorado, this is not a spot
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to talk about some exciting
shit that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I of course am the lead grower at the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens all day keeps me excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to do some fun shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fun at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I remember hearing people say like,
if you do something you love, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: feel like work all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there are a lot of shit about my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking feels like work all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying it doesn't, but there's a
lot of really fun shit that happened too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've got some 90% THC hash in my
elbow right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was only in the shop for like nine
hours was all it was on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically the first 15 people to find out
we had it, bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have bought it had I known it was
there and I don't even buy dispensary hash
[SPEAKER_03]: very often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two employees weren't at work and said,
put one in the safe for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And managers didn't get a shot at it and
bought shit off and under employees.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: First come first serve, deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of perks
like that just to just roll through
[SPEAKER_03]: randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's, I didn't, this wasn't a
topic planned for the show or anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: but let's talk about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fix this compressor here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did turn up your mic a touch,
but here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make this shit all work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about how people are always
coming in and dropping off applications to
[SPEAKER_02]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get a lot of emails on the irie
genetics, Facebook website, whatever my
[SPEAKER_02]: own personal Facebook, the grow from your
heart, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are always asking how do they,
they're always talking about how they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to work at a dispensary because they want
to play with weed all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it must be fun to play with weed as
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been a bud tender this
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're a bud tender for a little
while when we had the other dispensary,
[SPEAKER_02]: but going on about five months now,
five months now, has weed just basically
[SPEAKER_02]: become a product or is it something that's
fluffy and still amazing and unicorn shit
[SPEAKER_02]: still?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still unicorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we got it at a new edible option
that I've had in the back of my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I see one grab one and it's been
seven years now and I ain't fucking seen
[SPEAKER_03]: one and they showed up today in my own
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I have one sitting in my bag
right now that's going to get devoured
[SPEAKER_03]: here shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I saw that edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still, it's still like,
it's, you still have a unicorn to chase
[SPEAKER_02]: every day you go to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least once a week, something comes
through that getting it in, checking it
[SPEAKER_03]: out, getting to tell other people about it
all day just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now how much, what percentage of your day,
and I'm going somewhere with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of baiting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What percentage of your day is that
unicorn chase?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just titled it the unicorn chase at
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other 95% is fucking work,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to, for example,
like rolling, doing our pre-roll joints,
[SPEAKER_03]: we do like a pound worth at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's 450 joints and change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes days to go from, this is what
we're going to pre-roll to here's what we
[SPEAKER_03]: have on our pre-roll selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the entire time it's in the corner of
the sales floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have customers all day going,
Oh dude, that looks like the best job
[SPEAKER_03]: ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not at all the best job ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be if you could smoke one of them
the whole time you were rolling,
[SPEAKER_03]: then it wouldn't be so terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, just sit there and roll joint
after joint, after joint, after joint,
[SPEAKER_03]: after joint without being able to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your hands get sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't touch your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's easily the hardest grind at work
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trimming is going to equal that easily or
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I was headed with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, everybody wants to come work at
the dispensary, but keep in mind after you
[SPEAKER_02]: turn in your application, if we do hire
you, there will be a lot of tedious work.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we had a bunch of people come in and
apply today and two of them came well
[SPEAKER_03]: dressed, clean, appropriate, turned in
resumes, spoke eloquently and we'll get
[SPEAKER_03]: called, called back for an interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that showed up with lunch all over
his shirt at nine o'clock at night and was
[SPEAKER_03]: like half sloppy drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to work here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the info.
[SPEAKER_03]: He ain't going to work here.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is not going to work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not getting a call back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get dozens of people a day and
honestly, we're going to be hiring a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people here soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in Colorado is expanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's the industry is doubling this
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to double again next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if other States don't get to
legalize in 2015 and 2016, if it's only
[SPEAKER_03]: one more state, the industry is going to
triple at least in the next two or three
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means three times the employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spot has, I think I counted 20,
there's about 20 employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple that didn't come to
the meeting the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are about 20 of us full-time
employed there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're short staffed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could definitely use a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So turn in your resume at the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get your badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first thing you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys go get your badge and then come,
come apply at the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do, once you do get the job
there, be prepared to do some work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to just be playing with
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was another thing I wanted to
mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was talking about, well,
you guys are just hanging out smoking dope
[SPEAKER_02]: all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we can't even smoke tobacco on the
property because it might look like
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana on the cameras and we don't need
that mess with the regulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be, I think the rule is a
thousand feet from the premises before
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody is allowed to smoke in near any
dispensary is actually what I think the
[SPEAKER_02]: technical rule is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may not be true, but that's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there's a, like you can't
smoke in public in like parking lots or in
[SPEAKER_03]: public.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as on the dispensary premise
goes, we're specifically barred from
[SPEAKER_03]: having any sort of consumption allowed on
our property by state regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that includes all employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been a number of dispensaries
that have been fine because employees had
[SPEAKER_03]: like vape cartridge pens in their purses
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not supposed to have, I can't have
my rig in my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm on the clock, if my car is in
the parking lot at the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, you guys, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just opened up a fresh drink and I'm
burping it up while I'm recording here.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm in on the clock at the
dispensary working, I can't have my fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: shiny green Toro rig in my case,
in my backpack, in the car so that when I
[SPEAKER_02]: get off work, I can drive over to Mike's
house and dab him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't have it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if I'm going to a concert or a comedy
show after work, I can't have my rig in my
[SPEAKER_02]: car.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to, I'm a medical marijuana
patient and sometimes my back hurts and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes I will have to, no, no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I choose to, if I choose that I need to
medicate during working hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to drive home and take a dab,
eat lunch, and then drive all the way back
[SPEAKER_02]: to work because I can't bring my damn
backpack and dab rig to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like you shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people have seen my periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that once in a while I've dabbed
on my lunch break.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I get back to work,
it's like a fucking 30 minute drive back
[SPEAKER_02]: to the middle of the desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a little annoying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to leave town every day for work,
but I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've commuted much further.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much more shitty jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good drive to put on some music and
just jam out because it's a fast drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly highway miles, so it's legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put the show back on the damn road.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not allowed to smoke at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not allowed to, to medicate anywhere
near the building.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about it, it's when you go to
the liquor store, like is the clerk drunk?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you go to the gap, like fair
point, the kid's probably dressed in all
[SPEAKER_03]: the gap, but like we go so far with it at
work that there's a special protocol for
[SPEAKER_03]: employees buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We buy stuff all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every day, there's at least two
employees that worked that day buying
[SPEAKER_03]: something, but we've got special protocol
for it because if it's just like in my
[SPEAKER_03]: car, we can get a lot of trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even if it's, so what happens if you
go in and you buy that diesel hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you have to do with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes in the safe until the end of the
shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then right at the end of the night,
like as for we locked the front door,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's employees wanted anybody buying
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we all queue up just like
custies.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right at the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it all gets sealed in an exit
bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it does for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we can't throw it in a backpack or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's all, it's all official so that
there's no question about us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've told me not to even bring my
backpack.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, once in a while I'm going to
have to bring clothes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I work in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm required by the department of
agriculture to have a change of at least
[SPEAKER_02]: one change of clothes, like all the way
down to the underwear and socks in a
[SPEAKER_02]: locker accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm handling pesticides and other
chemicals and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need, I'm required to have a change
of clothes, but they're like, bring his
[SPEAKER_02]: little backpack and stuff as you need to
bring here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't, we don't want backpacks and
shit coming into the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need it on camera, especially
going to the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, please just don't like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pretty much take what I haven't said
anything about mine because it never
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves the security desk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come up, I come in and it gets set on
the counter and it comes off the counter
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I leave, I go into the back and it's
like a labyrinth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of nooks and crannies
and there wouldn't be anywhere really to
[SPEAKER_02]: put my backpack anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your locker, it wouldn't fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lockers are only the lockers are
teeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been back there since the
lockers came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're purse size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got a purse, yeah, that's what
they're for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of way off topic here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I don't even know what the hell
we're talking about anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, it was a really good week.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are not from Colorado kind of
like to hear our, our, how our lives are
[SPEAKER_02]: and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're two dudes at work,
it just, that's one of the fun part,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: People come in every day and are just
blown the fuck away about how regular it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many, uh, so I heard another person
ask this and I thought it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to talk about it in a
future episode, but since you're here,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the breakdown of people,
where they're from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how many people are Colorado folk?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people are from out of state?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there, am I talking shit when I say
that probably 50% of the people that come
[SPEAKER_02]: in are from Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fully, especially if we do a break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakdown over the, if we're talking about
like a year range, easily half the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that come through most recreational
dispensaries or tourists, that's
[SPEAKER_03]: statewide.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Places like Aspen, it's like 80 or 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, marijuana is crazy expensive up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get people from Aspen in our shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy expensive in Aspen and they're
down in Pueblo because they were driving
[SPEAKER_03]: through the area and weed maps told them
to stop here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they get loaded up before they head
back to their city in Colorado where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: way more expensive and touristy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but easily half the people that roll
through are from Texas and it comes in
[SPEAKER_03]: bizarre waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on one day, everybody will be from
Alabama.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next day, everybody will be from
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday it was Missouri and truckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a busload.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they actually travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come from Kansas and they all come
together and they all, they always show up
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 and they come about once a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 10 of them that show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a field trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens way more often than you'd
think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like families come through today.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a girl with her grandmother and
her grandmother just had a filthy mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirty joke after dirty joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the granddaughter was mortified and
they're buying weed together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, we get shit like that
constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandma and granddaughter buying her
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all blown away because we have
marijuana stores where you can walk in and
[SPEAKER_03]: just like every other store, there's a
salesperson there to tell you all about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest obstacle to the shop is the
security guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have an ID that says you're
21.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got that going into buy some,
he goes, it'll be a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he makes sure that there's somebody
back there and he goes, go on back and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can go buy weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't know what to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I don't get to spend a lot of
time upfront because I'm supposed to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: the back in the cave growing the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes I got to venture up to the
front.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go find a boss and now they're
hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just find myself in the bedroom
watching and seeing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a good portion of the people that I
meet are from out of state and they all
[SPEAKER_02]: see the little board with the pins in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I just gave everybody in
America, like a weird, shitty Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: accent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, that's our little map to
mark where everybody's from.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your spot doesn't have a pin,
if your city doesn't have a pin,
[SPEAKER_02]: put a pin in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see everybody trying to find the
little spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had two from Michigan today when I was
up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get somebody from a different country at
least once a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people from all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can, we had a bunch of just gorgeous
girls from New Zealand come through one
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just on the regular people from all
over the planet coming to Colorado to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're coming through Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that sometimes I go up front
and there might be some really beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: women in the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten way far off topic here,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a spot commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to go for 20 minutes about
work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a spot commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: We spend a lot of time at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cool shit happens there, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cool shit does happen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, I've got a news article that I
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get there, guys, I wanted to
tell you what's going on in another realm
[SPEAKER_02]: of my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking about Damsel's Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have not been keeping up,
if you don't listen to every single
[SPEAKER_02]: episode, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't listen to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other shit to listen to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your homework, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not familiar with the suicide
girls, make yourself familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't look at the suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will maybe do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you work at the spot, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: The suicide girls are models and they
mostly are like tattooed and have some
[SPEAKER_02]: piercings and maybe some dreadlocks here
and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not your normal cover girl model.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think burlesque is the word you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be the word I'm trying to fish
out of my brain here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the help.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these diesel dabs are making my brain
sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I've got a suicide girl who's a
friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes by Duditz Damsel is her suicide
girl name.
[SPEAKER_02]: She works with Green and Healthy Wellness,
a dispensary in Colorado Springs that is
[SPEAKER_02]: now relocating.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're building the new facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are fans of Green and Healthy
Wellness, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be open pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be announcing the grand opening on
the show, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so Duditz Damsel asked me to
develop a strain for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I have got two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started three phenotypes,
three different strains from seed that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to phenotype from for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of those are now into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are about 48 hours into flower,
I think, somewhere around there at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: In about nine weeks, we will have the
first two test batches of Damsel's Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Duditz Damsel, my favorite suicide
girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damsel and I, and a few other suicide
girls, and my buddy the Grimy Gatsby,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a couple of the Terpy Boys,
and a few other folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's giving me the head nod like,
wait, you said a few other suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers are looking good here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a tasting party.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably be in Colorado Springs,
possibly Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just hoping on a test kit for
myself, but fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, depending on how much herb there is,
you may get a little sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may get a sample of what gets selected
because there will be things that she
[SPEAKER_02]: likes that I don't like, that I don't
like, that she does like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I said that the opposite,
but as the grower and the breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: all like different things than her.
[SPEAKER_02]: For her, we're looking for one specific
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be something that pops out of
this search for us that we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep that has nothing to do with her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's more what I wanted it for is
I wanted to get it on the phenohunt for an
[SPEAKER_03]: entirely different reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, let's find my new medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This party sounds kind of awesome too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the party will be pretty damn fun
from what I hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to throw a party.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Hunt is the Terp gatherer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: In like nine weeks, we should have some
damsels dank to sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep you guys updated on how that
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be here to take some pictures
and things pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to, we'll try to get dams on the
podcast before too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys, since green and healthy had
to relocate without a lot of warning,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are fucking slammed and busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see, we've been going 22
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to read an article or do we
want to talk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's go read this news article I've
got here because I found this interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of, Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this will help some people out and
this will definitely interest Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike doesn't know what I'm going to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will definitely get your attention,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline says FDA issues warnings to
makers of legal CBD hemp oil products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go and find who it's by so I can
give them credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by Thomas H.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark from the daily chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it on the daily chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will read the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers should be aware of purchasing
and using any such products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FDA says the food and drug
administration has sent letters to several
[SPEAKER_02]: makers of cannabidiol oils derived from
him telling them to stop making medical
[SPEAKER_02]: claims about their product's ability to
treat disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many sellers of the hemp based cannabidiol
products who advertise their products is
[SPEAKER_02]: legal in all 50 states because they are
derived from industrial hemp have been
[SPEAKER_02]: making claims that their products are rich
in cannabidiol and can be used for the
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,
or preventation of diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the FDA, the FDA,
which considers CBD and unapproved new
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs said these companies are misbranding
the products and issuing false claims to
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often these products do not even list
their ingredients on the product labeled
[SPEAKER_02]: the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FDA said consumers should be aware of
purchasing and using any such products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is important to note that these
products are not approved by the FDA for
[SPEAKER_02]: the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
treatment, or prevention of any disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: In late February, the FDA issued several
warning letters to seven companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacture and market hemp oils claiming
to be rich in CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: By promising cures for conditions such as
cancer, autism, and epilepsy, none of
[SPEAKER_02]: which have been tested by the FDA,
the companies who were issued warning
[SPEAKER_02]: letters appear to be vital in highlighting
food and drug labeling laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases... God, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The throat's going crazy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: This happens occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mug it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mug it sounds like I'm doing something
dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might take a drink of that delicious
root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mugging it sounds like, I don't know,
that just sounded gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, the companies could not
even spell cannabidiol or inflammation
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly, the FDA notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff's been on the market for a
while and it's always been crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing that I wanted to get to is
a lot of this stuff is brought in from
[SPEAKER_02]: other countries because now that we have
got this market, they're doing kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like what they did with spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see that this CBD stuff is really
popular and they're just sending us crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be partially CBD, so they can write
that on the bottle, but then it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: other random oils just as a filler.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even know what you're giving
these sick kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get... I'll finish reading the
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll try to remember where I am with
this rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The following companies and products were
among those notified by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there are hyperlinks here also,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lists a bunch of companies,
CancerHerbTea.com of Florida, CBD Life
[SPEAKER_02]: Holdings of Arizona, Hemp Oil Care of
California, Pure CBD of Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lists a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it also says the FDA also conducted
tests of some products sold by these
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and found that in most cases,
the products contained very little
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabidiol or none at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some bullet points that show
some of the test findings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't read them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the FDA tested two separate
samples of Ultra CBD sold by CBD Life
[SPEAKER_02]: Holdings for its one ounce bottle for $45
on their website or on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the samples tested, one did not contain
any cannabinoids, while the second
[SPEAKER_02]: contained only 0.02% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the products tested by the FDA that
were found to contain some CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Ultra CBD products contained the
smallest percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are paying for stuff that doesn't
even have any CBD in it, which is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: make me wonder, what is in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a big issue for a lot of USCO
states that have passed Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_03]: Style laws that allow for CBD only
products, but they don't allow for you to
[SPEAKER_03]: get them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, the law requires you to come
to Colorado or another legal state,
[SPEAKER_03]: buy something, and then break a bunch of
federal laws on your way home.
[SPEAKER_02]: By taking it home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're able to smuggle it home,
you can go ahead and then legally use it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's mildly insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're Googling and you see,
hey, hemp oil, CBD, legal in all 50
[SPEAKER_03]: states.
CBD oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even say hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's CBD oil is what this one package
says.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're lucky, you're getting hemp seed
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, you're getting the bottom layer of
whatever oil some company in China makes
[SPEAKER_02]: and decided to bottle up and label it as
THC or CBD oil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: The article keeps going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to finish this up just so we can
finish the whole article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, the warned CBD companies have 15
days to show the FDA how they are
[SPEAKER_02]: complying with the warning letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Failure to promptly correct these
violations may result in legal action
[SPEAKER_02]: without further notice, including without
limitation seizure and or injunction,
[SPEAKER_02]: the FDA warns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana experts suggest patients
considering CBD treatment to instead seek
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD rich strains of cannabis grown in
states that allow medical marijuana such
[SPEAKER_02]: as Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who also require independent laboratory
testing of all marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So medical experts are even saying what
Mike and I say, go to Colorado and get
[SPEAKER_02]: some lab tested facility grown quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't have any pesticides in it
because if it does, it's been quarantined
[SPEAKER_02]: and taken away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're almost to where we need to be
regulatory wise here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going the wrong direction with
their new regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where they need to be adding stuff is
in pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those regulations aren't up to speed yet
because the testing labs aren't in place
[SPEAKER_03]: yet because the FDA won't certify testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just spirals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of our dumb ass prohibition to
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everybody that listens to the show
knows what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The solution there is to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do it already.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the FDA would already be
overseeing all this hemp seed extract
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be able to legally confidently buy
CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's legit CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd know what you were taking or giving
your kid or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is partially like to warn people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're buying this crappy CBD oil,
you're probably not getting any help for
[SPEAKER_02]: your ailment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if it, you know, if it's like,
what if, what if it's a placebo effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's working and you felt better,
what do you, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should they quit doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause maybe they're taking some weird
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not telling you to take or not to take
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: If something works, it works for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But who knows what you're taking guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the advice here is to come to Colorado
or legalize it where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fight for legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guidance is when it comes time to
legalize in your area, don't pass CBD only
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass cannabis, like recreational or
medical cannabis use to where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: consume flour, to where you can make
extracts, to where you can consume
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts and edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it all part of that because just the
CBD is only going to work for a very small
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of the medical cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD doesn't do a thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I need my THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a CBD episode coming up on the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, I know I keep saying that,
but I'm putting it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some episodes I can throw
together in like a day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD episode is going to take me quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a series.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get several people to talk on
it and tell us how CBD treats them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mike is definitely going to be one of
the people on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find some medical patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really big topic folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a huge topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It deserves some good prep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of notes on it already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug is going to be part of that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike will be part of that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get a lot of people on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just met a few people recently that are
well known in the CBD community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll help us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're finally starting to get CBD
products reliably in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got all tongue tied.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking to the purchaser for the
shop and he was asking us what he asked us
[SPEAKER_02]: for guidance.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that we're potheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, what should I buy guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he showed us an order that he was able
to get really high CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we encouraged him to do that for the
rec shop so that we've got that available
[SPEAKER_02]: for people as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys try some CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what it does for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people it's the miracle for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so like I'm saying, don't go with the
CBD only because CBD only wouldn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the synergistic effect is what we're
searching for.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, we need a little,
a little bit of THC to make it all work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all one, one unified thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes time to legalize guys,
make sure you don't just do CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to give a shout out to the author
of this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to remind you who it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Thomas H.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark from The Daily Chronic, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful if you're using hemp oil CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make yourself sicker than you
already are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know what you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're buying stuff from a shop and it
doesn't have lab testing, start asking for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's just a matter of time until
this is just like everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to a store and buy something,
you know what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look at the label on it and know
what's in it and be sure that what's on
[SPEAKER_03]: the label is actually in it because the
FDA is testing this randomly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we have the MED backing you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in Colorado, the FDA is not allowed
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we literally had to create from the
ground up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our own MED, they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I remember when the first testing
labs were open, the state didn't give a
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the industry demanding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients were beginning to demand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shops needed to know what they were
putting out and testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I was able to take my
product, my finished flowers, my hash to a
[SPEAKER_02]: shop and have it tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's discussions of reopening labs to
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so because right now they've locked
down the rules so tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, part of the thing is that the shops
have them so overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so few labs that are qualified
that right now, if I wanted to take my
[SPEAKER_02]: product, I'd probably have to wait a month
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just disallowed us to be able to
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one type of testing and I honestly
can't remember what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not potency, but I can't remember
what the specialty test we were hoping to
[SPEAKER_03]: get done.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one lab and it's in Durango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a residual solvent test is what
you guys are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's only for hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can only do that in Durango.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're literally discussing who
we're going to send it to Durango because
[SPEAKER_03]: we can't send stuff through the mail to
the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of us is going to draw the short
straw and drive like 14 hours across the
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ballparking.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I might need a day off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the opposite of fun, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Steep Hill Halen can possibly do
those same tests, but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't don't quote me there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a discussion I overheard a
couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard part of that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we're talking about labs and
such.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today in one of the offices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much talk about work on this episode,
huh, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we did all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been like 10 days without a day
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I think about right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been gone about 33 minutes,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple more things here that
I'm going to save because this right here
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to talk about I'm just going to
give it a couple of quick seconds here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we don't have to get too much into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys follow the UFC a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge UFC follower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I follow Joe Rogan more than I follow the
UFC, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my third degree of separation or
whatever you're going to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is something that happened in
the UFC that as a pothead, as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: activist, as somebody who was part of the
marijuana community, this got my
[SPEAKER_02]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a UFC fighter who tested positive
for using cannabis, who has been suspended
[SPEAKER_02]: for five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: His career has been put on hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: His salary has been put on hold and they
also find him a hundred and fifty thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars for passing for failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A P test for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this dude, that's his job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this guy has trained his whole
life for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally, totally insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a couple of different reasons
why it's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if it was steroids, this would be a
little insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like five years is an insanely long amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a performance enhancing drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's been shown to be helpful in
protecting against concussions and
[SPEAKER_03]: recovering from head injuries.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys get punched and kicked in the
face for a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his job.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a thousand different reasons
why this insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I loved I'm going to probably butcher
her name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize because she could for sure
kick my ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's Rhonda Rousey just
independently went off during a press
[SPEAKER_03]: conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only peripherally followed this
story, but she went off for basically the
[SPEAKER_03]: same reasons I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: To misquote Rhonda Rousey, but to
paraphrase and misquote her, basically
[SPEAKER_02]: what she said was if somebody uses
steroids and they're in a ring fighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: that potentially gives them the ability to
hit me harder and kill me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they are smoking cannabis,
that gives them the ability to heal
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're smoking a plant that was put here
for us to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to punish people for it is
basically what she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fuck it all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already told you that, but I totally
agree with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhonda Rousey is absolutely on the money
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to beg you guys to sign the
petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't signed it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you guys want, if you're,
if you're into the UFC and you think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong that this dude's been suspended,
then here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did give him three P tests and two of
them were clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this third one was not even necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was by, I've got a news article on the
screen that I was going to read,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I didn't even want to get that far
into this, but it says Diaz submitted
[SPEAKER_02]: three urine samples on the night,
one prior to his fight and two in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hours afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really going quickly through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of those three samples, the first and the
third administered under the world
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-doping agency protocol and submitted
for testing to the WADA accredited sports
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine research and testing lab in Salt
Lake city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those came back clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the world anti-doping agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't cheat that P test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care how bad you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see your wiener.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see your dick when you're peeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They watch the pee come out of the head of
your pee hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it comes, they watch it into the
container and then they fucking seal it
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're wearing rubber gloves and catching
it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the only reason I'm not an MMA
fighter, but it's on the fucking list.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it says, however, the 10 30 PM
test, however, was administered by a
[SPEAKER_02]: separate testing representative and
submitted to quest diagnostics,
[SPEAKER_02]: a non WADA accredited lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that lab's not even accredited.
[SPEAKER_02]: That test came back over the threshold for
allowable marijuana metabolites resulting
[SPEAKER_02]: in the lone positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Test this company that tested him,
isn't even accredited by the world
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-doping agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did pass there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Las Vegas sporting, whatever you're
called, the Nevada sporting and something
[SPEAKER_02]: commission.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not cool with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys need to go, uh, just sign the
petition so that Nick Diaz can get back,
[SPEAKER_02]: get his career back five years for a UFC
fighter, dude, that would, that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like half of your career.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you only get to go from your
early twenties until maybe 30 something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get in the mid thirties,
testosterone starts dropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't take a punch as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to come back like Tyson after
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fucking knee blows out or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what do you mean talking silly and
chasing pigeons?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, like destroying people with just
destroying people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be need to see, but I don't
want to have to wait five years to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the dude should get to be able to
fight for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just another example of why
everyone needs to get involved and get
[SPEAKER_03]: educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this guy doesn't get to fight for
five years because he pee dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people are losing their kids because
they pee dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like other people are going to jail
because they're selling people pot that
[SPEAKER_02]: people want because we want to smoke a
plant while other people can drink some
[SPEAKER_02]: shit that makes them drive like maniacs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Oh, I can't blame it on alcohol,
but yeah, because people want to smoke a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not allowed to have the careers we
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude can't fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is terrible because we all hang back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we all get shit on regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's enough for Nick Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Support that you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mike, thanks for joining me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't want to end on a down note.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what positive shit you got for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a fat dab and give your mama a hug
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my line, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more shit to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for something positive there
and that's the first thing that popped
[SPEAKER_03]: into my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: The positive thing is that we will be back
or at least I will be back next Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a whole nother episode for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about, um,
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been, cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in an argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, not an argument, a discussion
with a stranger on Facebook about is
[SPEAKER_02]: holding your smoke a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thinks you get higher from holding your
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that was his statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll talk about other people's
theories, including mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to be involved in this,
we will schedule this for a time when Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: can return for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'd like to get your, well,
it's not going to be the whole show,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody else would like to come and
be on that, I think that it's not a good
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think it's a good idea,
message me, I'd like your opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me your opinion either way,
holding your smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take a bong hit, when you take a
dab, when you take a smoke off of a joint,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think it's a good idea to hold in
your smoke for a few seconds?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you think you should hold in
your smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do you hold in your smoke differently
for your dab than you do a joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let me hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's, you want to hold your
smoke or do you want to just in and out?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you hold it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think if you hold it for 10 or 15
seconds, you're getting higher?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me hear your opinion on that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you can tweet it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's under 140 characters, it's at GFYH
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's longer than that, you're going to
have to email me at grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_02]: at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or of course you can hit me up on the
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just find me as a grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're one of my friends, just fucking
text me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny when I get text messages
about the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, um, I'm going to delete your
text message and I'll forget because I
[SPEAKER_02]: delete all my messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I'm rambling now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact me and let me know what you think
about holding in your smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's what's coming up on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to think about more
positive shit over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also rattling through my brain about
what I've read about holding in the smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: and cause yeah, there's multiple opinions
on this topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting, yeah, we'll save that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get that out on another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, let's wrap up the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of some positive shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some positive shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you read that the CERN, a large hadron
collider was supposed to open up two black
[SPEAKER_02]: holes, which is going to open a wormhole
and the earth was going to be swallowed
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're all going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was supposed to happen on the 23rd
and we're recording on the 24th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a positive note.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce Willis destroyed the meteor again,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: How come Bruce Willis gets to be the hero
in this story?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it'd be Arnold Schwarzenegger or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, he got to be the governor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all he gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce Willis is just old and bald.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give him the win on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs something right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap up
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I are fucking chatty and high as
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diesel dabs, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those diesel dabs made me sativa-eyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made me sativa everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you for coming and hanging
out, taking an hour out of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a new baby at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, thanks for taking time away from that
little guy to come hang out with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what that's like prying you away
from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you want to get back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, make sure you guys follow Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let him know that you found him here
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes to know where the followers came
from, where his stalkers arrived from.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's easy to tell like when it's
2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: and I haven't tweeted in a day and a half
and it's a stonery name in photo,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can assume other times I have no fucking
clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Dabby McDaberson just followed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet that's from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's going to make up a screen name
Dabby McDaberson and tweet me from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I really want to thank you for
listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again to Mike for showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'll be back in another week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, I don't have any sponsors for
this month's podcast or this month for the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.

show, uh, send me an email to grow from
[SPEAKER_02]: your heart at hotmail.com.

[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth five stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We deserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We deserve a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that type in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bought a lot of toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, um, well, I already said to
follow me on all the social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget the show is available on
iTunes and Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single episode is always and
forever, uh, archived on I read genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: colorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll never go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do apologize that the website has not
been updated in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my web guy has been occupied with
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to let him do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he gets out of school, then he'll fix
up the website school first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to distract him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all about education here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I did say education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what else do we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all we got for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until next time, I need to give a huge,
huge shout out to manager spins in the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire garden of weed and crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, big shout out to my new rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has been named Juanita.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Juanita.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a cute little Toro rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: She hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks really good with the email on
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you're quiet about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You looked at it and looked away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that bitch done hurt me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like her and that, that furniture table
she's sitting on is sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we should, God, we should shout out
furniture while we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't do any shout outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big shout out to burniture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, check out big cartel dot or it's
burniture.bigcartel.com or go to big
[SPEAKER_02]: cartel.com search for burniture and look
what they're making.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making coffee tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making all kinds of random shit
that you can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fucking email built into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you can have an email built into
some random shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one just made a weird twinkling
noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that was your phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cooler than the email doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that wasn't a feature that I knew
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your new rig does not have digital alerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, we're getting out of
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to manager spins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge shout out to my homie, Mike,
for coming over until next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a fat dab and give your mama hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
