[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 831 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we're going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to invite you to the Dude Grows
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dude Grows crew is throwing the DGC
Growers Cup once again this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: June 1st in La Porte, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dude Grows crew will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Irish Army will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do invite you to join us at the Dude
Grows Growers Cup, June 1st in La Porte,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all
of the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get too far into the show,
I do want to send a big thank you shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to everybody who sent me some birthday
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you supported the birthday sale on
ireadirect.com, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sent me a text message,
an email, a Patreon message, a Discord
[SPEAKER_01]: message, if you reached out in some sort
of a way, if you saw me in person,
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me a high five, a fist bump,
or a hug, thank you for all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did notice it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thank you that did not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fist bump back to everybody and big
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the happy birthday sale is still
going at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you missed the birthday sale,
things are restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you go hit ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, by the time this episode comes out,
there will be more of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testers will be restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the 90s and the ire skunk will be
restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk more about those later
in the show, but those are restocked if
[SPEAKER_01]: you missed them, so have no fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go hit ireadirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The birthday sale is still going and
things have been restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think that's enough
advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, I did ask for some help with
short clips from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send a big thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To everybody who has sent me shorts,
I got overloaded with emails from the
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got overloaded with a lot of great
shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't posted all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've posted a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have been sending me short videos,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm filtering through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working out deals and relationships
with some of the people that have sent
[SPEAKER_01]: them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for all of those short clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you guys have seen some of them
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing a great job sending
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, big thank you for all of
the short clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent out that call of action and you did
respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the next order of business?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I had to update my mailing list
service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you are a part of the iRead
genetics mailing list.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do a new drop, a new sale,
if something cool happens, I do try to
[SPEAKER_01]: send you an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to spam you too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately, I've been sending a lot,
I do know, but I did have to change my
[SPEAKER_01]: mailing service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something went wrong with the service I
was using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, they said I violated terms of
service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in communication with them trying to
get that account back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is I had to update my mailing
list service.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're getting an email that does
not look like the old emails I send,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's because they changed my format.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to change formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not used to it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning it, but I'm trying to get the
old account back.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is if you're getting emails from
iRead genetics that don't look the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new service.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new format.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to go back to MailChimp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if she'll take me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, if you're getting those emails,
that is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said, hey, is this really you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like your messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for checking on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for making sure that really is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check your spam because I've been
sending a couple of new emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this comes out, you'll
probably get an update that those skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: testers have restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me make sure I've covered the
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you gals, I have ordered new
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is new merchandise coming to iRead
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those t-shirts will not be on iRead
direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be on a different website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have an Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it does sound odd to have two
different websites and sell products on
[SPEAKER_01]: two different spots, but there is a
business purpose and a business method for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The t-shirts will be on the Etsy website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my website, iRead genetics
.com, there's a tab that says merch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that merch tab,
that will take you right to the Etsy
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be new t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the older t-shirts will be back up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are dab mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be hats up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be new merch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you show up to the dude grows growers
cup wearing an iRead genetics or an iRead
[SPEAKER_01]: army t-shirt or a hoodie, if you've got
the t-shirt or the hoodie on and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: visible and you're wearing it,
it's not covered up with a jacket or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's rainy, I'll give you an excuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can see that you're wearing iRead
army gear, a hat would even count.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you show up wearing iRead army gear,
I will give you a free prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot promise you what the prize will
be right now, but anybody who shows up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the dude grows cup wearing iRead army or
iRead genetics gear will receive a free
[SPEAKER_01]: gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk up to the booth and say, hey bro,
I was told if I was wearing this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get a free gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give you something cool or I will
authorize Mike to give you something cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be worth your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grab some new iRead gear or rock that
old iRead gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I want everybody at the dude
grows cup to be wearing iRead genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come represent, come show the iRead army
is strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come show that iRead genetics is strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up, represent at the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a free gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is all of the business part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go over my list really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the new mail service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you wear a shirt at the cup,
you'll get a free gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we've covered all of the
business here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work our way into the email portion
of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This email did come from the grow help tab
on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My website is iRead genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I R I E genetics.com iRead genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to iRead genetics.com on the top of
that website.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them says questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or grow help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what it says right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either questions or grow help.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty obvious what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab, you are given
the opportunity to send me a grow question
[SPEAKER_01]: or just a basic question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good question that came from
that tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use that grow help tab and I read
your question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: that means you will win a free coupon code
for a free pack of seeds from iRead direct
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read direct.com is the vending website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics.com is the hub where
everything else is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds difficult, but it does
make sense once you get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, if I read your grow question off
of that grow help tab, you will win a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that won a free pack of seeds
today goes by Trent Gill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my new friend,
Trent Gill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trent's question goes a little bit just
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, sorry to be a
pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pesting at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to answer most of them or reply
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if I don't get to all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not bugging me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep sending those emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm still curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between the 90s and
the iRead skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already ordered a pack of the 90s
skunk, but I'm thinking about adding on a
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of the iRead if that is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here's a part that is kind of a
conversation, but I'm going to address
[SPEAKER_01]: this here just because I've got the
opportunity on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I don't know if I can Venmo the
cash or cash app or send the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to pay shipping twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that I could do that, but it's not
just a one man kind of a me and you doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a deal operations sort of a thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shipping app.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all got to go through that website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all got to be official.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the order is in, I can't really amend
the orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people will send me an email
saying, hey, you're going to send me a
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of 4k freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you swap that out with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of orders that I'm getting are
overwhelming and I can't keep tabs of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the switches, all the substitutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that the system is set up,
there will be mistakes if I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I finally got the system figured out
to where there are minimal mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say we don't make
mistakes, but everybody's trained well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows their role in the
packaging and sending part of the deal
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not making as many mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to take a cash app or a Venmo
from you, I would have to figure out where
[SPEAKER_01]: that order goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a, I know it sounds stupid,
but it's just another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all done that way for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: The orders all go to ship station,
all the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have helped shipping them honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people helping me ship have to see
it in ship station.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to go that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds stubborn, but it's a
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way we're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't mistakes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what matters the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the people that helped me
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I send you Venmo cash app?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's not an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to pay shipping twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that, but I'm going to give
you a free pack of seeds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won't have to pay shipping twice
and you're going to get some free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, is one of, and then we're going
to get, he goes back to talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk testers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to say, is one of the
skunk testers more Indica leaning or more
[SPEAKER_01]: satirical?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the iris skunk involve your lemon
skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something different bread to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says, I love some good skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he wraps it up with the stink is just
a bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says, there's some more stuff
here, but I don't need to read all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thanks man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you have an awesome day from Trent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Trent, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some answers, but honestly,
I'm going to be quite vague.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to talking about testers,
I try not to give you too many details
[SPEAKER_01]: because that will bias or sway your
testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now you've got some seeds and you
don't know what to expect other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: hopes of skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I've told you guys, it takes
about nine to 10 weeks for these to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I want you to finish them out on
time and let them do the right flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's about all the details I really
want to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try not to give you guys too much
information about the testers because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to bias or sway your testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I've seen from these plants
and I'm not too far ahead of you guys in
[SPEAKER_01]: the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I'm having fun with them just
like you guys, but I know what I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: from the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I want to see if you guys
discover in those phenotypes and what you
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if you're seeing the same
things as me, if you're discovering the
[SPEAKER_01]: same things I do, or if you're getting
different things in different rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to give you too many
ideas because if I say one does this or
[SPEAKER_01]: one does this, you'll be looking for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it puts a fixation on things and it
creates bias within the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a blind study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the seeds are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're not intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they germ well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know their quality, but I'm looking for
certain specific traits to see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys get just for documentation and then
for advertising a lot also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys are going to discover a lot
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to the testers,
I don't give out a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got notes here to keep me on track
because I'm highest draft pussy,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you too much because it will
bias your testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these came from how much information do
I want to give you?
[SPEAKER_01]: These came from two different batches of
skunk number one seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are seeds of skunk number one
from two different batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also the skunk number one clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is another batch of seeds that
we played with and grew some skunks out
[SPEAKER_01]: of, but that didn't make it to this round
of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I can tell you is one is they're
both skunk number ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we did the pheno hunting,
myself and another friend of mine went
[SPEAKER_01]: through these plants and grew them and
smoked them and scrutinized these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of the skunk number one seeds that
we started with, if it had that sweet or
[SPEAKER_01]: that cinnamon, some had cinnamon,
if it had sweet or like seasoning sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: smells, it went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only things that passed through our
rigorous, the casting couch, the pheno
[SPEAKER_01]: hunts were the ridiculous rotten skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to share too much because
like I said, it's going to sway your
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, but they are both from skunk
number one seed stock and they are skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's none of the sweet shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's none of the candy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I focused on straight skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to elaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to get away from this topic
before I tell you way too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like I've already told you
enough, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tossed anything sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two different skunk number one
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from seed plus the skunk number
one clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original OG clone is in the breeding,
but you guys aren't getting that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not in this batch, which means that
there are more skunk crosses coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you guys test these, there will be
more skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a skunk number one, an S1 from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, there's possibly Melfranks,
turban poison, into skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already said too much, but,
um, that's as much as I could tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just rambled a long time about
that skunk and I can't give you too much
[SPEAKER_01]: info because I don't want to sway your
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're talking about buying another
pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see what happens if you
ran both packs under the same environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that would tell me a lot of stuff that
would help me continue my breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, run them both if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, here's a good update.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those skunks are restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have said this by now, but by the
time this episode comes out, there will be
[SPEAKER_01]: more of those skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nineties and the iry skunk,
both will be available at irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, Trent Gill, by the time this
episode comes out, make sure you check
[SPEAKER_01]: your email, uh, check your spam because
oftentimes those gift codes do go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: spam folder, but you should have a coupon
code for a free pack of iry genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: premium seeds from irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if you have any trouble with
that, please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people said, they had tech
difficulties using the gift cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll guide you right through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another great question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one has been coming up quite a bit,
so I figured it was time to answer this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question came from my good friend,
Dylan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to Dylan on Facebook for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dylan sent this question on the grow help
tab on the iry genetics website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that Dylan, you win a free
pack of seeds from irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your email because
you've got a coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your free beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a question about the
structural terms of the cannabis plant on
[SPEAKER_01]: your descriptions of your awesome strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It mentions the term more open structured
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on
what that means and what to expect from
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently waiting for scarlet
begonias, redline morning dew and
[SPEAKER_01]: candylicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait for that run to get
started, but that's going to be a good
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some classics in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the scarlet begonias is a classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The morning dew is a classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, redline is going to be a classic in my
lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a hitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sleep on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then candylicious, that's one of the
most current newest, uh, fems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is hot fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a good lineup in there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the dream team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I can't wait to see the pictures also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you send me photos, my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I've previously grown your
feminized golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for sharing all of your
knowledge and all of your excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Dylan, we love you back,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Dylan is asking about the terms I am
using when I talk about the structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since he listed four plants here,
before I get into my notes that I made,
[SPEAKER_01]: my little chart that I wrote about
structure, I'm going to address the four
[SPEAKER_01]: plants he's talking about scarlet
begonias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so if I was talking about structures
of plants, it's just like talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: like, if you looked at people or if you
looked at trees, like I'm tall and skinny
[SPEAKER_01]: and lanky, that's a way to describe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if somebody was built different than
me, you could say that they were short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pudgy or thick might be the word or
just different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing with the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding words that apply to the shape
and structure of the plant that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: would translate to most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going to talk about scarlet
begonias, scarlet begonias is built mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the phenotypes are built like me,
tall, lanky, kind of stretchy,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of skinny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're going to stretch out a lot in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would call that a tall, stretchy,
branchy kind of plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tall, lanky and stretchy and branchy
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can say that red line, uh,
red line is a little bit more bushy,
[SPEAKER_01]: which bushy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, now that I'm giving you some
descriptors to compare it to bushy,
[SPEAKER_01]: it bushes out just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scarlet begonias goes up, up,
up and out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red line goes out quite a bit and not
up as vigorously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're starting to figure out the
different, the ways I'm applying these
[SPEAKER_01]: words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morning dew, morning dew, uh, she will
grow kind of wide, kind of bushy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also she'll get a nice apical dominant
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, she has that open structure I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you look at the, the red line,
she's bushy and messy on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the branches that come up are making a
bunch of leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all tight together in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just messy on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get in there and clean that
shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The morning dew is a little bit more open
to where when you get in there to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, the branches aren't so
claustrophobic on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of widened up itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, open is the word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: More airflow, less, uh, nonsensical
branching down at the bottom, less
[SPEAKER_01]: unnecessary leafing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the open, uh, more branchy bushy
structure from the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now candylicious, uh, candylicious has
some phenotypes to get pretty tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also it's got a lot of branching that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now here's another descriptor I talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the branches of the plants will,
um, they'll come out and they'll curve up
[SPEAKER_01]: and those branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you'll notice reach the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to make an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of plants will shoot branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go at an angle, like a 45
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is about a 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just go shoot, shoot, shoot,
and they'll just come straight off and
[SPEAKER_01]: those will get kind of messy sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that all that shit gets
confused in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tighter, more narrow,
more closed up plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see that from the, uh,
the candylicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that part comes from the,
the afterglow, the afterglow makes it grow
[SPEAKER_01]: messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are just quick ways to describe
the four plants that you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do have a little flow chart that I
made here for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could call it, um, to talk about
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the first thing that we usually talk
about is frame and shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been focused on mostly
here to start, um, frame and shape things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would use to describe the frame and
shape our words, like a tight structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: a tight frame, an open frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me talk about a tight frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some plants will grow, uh, you get
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use my arm as the main stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some plants, you'll have a branch
coming, a pair of branches coming here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a pair of branches coming here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about three or four inches apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes it'll be eight to 10
inches apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I say tight, that means they're closer
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the structure is just tighter,
more compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would say orange gasm compared to a
rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange gasm is a tighter golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a much tighter plant compared to a
rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise just spreads itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mansplains or man spreads takes up all the
room on the bus where golden goat stays a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit tighter, keeps into its own
space a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a tight structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That open structure is the next word on my
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those are the plants where they're
more open on the bottom and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: spread out on their own a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The branches aren't touching and
everything's growing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just more open.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drew a silhouette of it,
you could kind of see some space of the
[SPEAKER_01]: background through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a big bushy messy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next word I've got is stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've mentioned a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise can be a tall, stretchy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Tripper can be a tall, stretchy
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes that fishing pole in the middle,
that long, tall fishing pole branch with
[SPEAKER_01]: all those long, tall, stretchy branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have dealt with stretchy before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my stuff unfortunately can be a
bit stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the opposite of that is squatty
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys grown those plants that they
don't go up a lot, Nuketown will do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuketown grows outward a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it stays low.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a low squatty plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a low grow space,
I may recommend the Nuketown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may shoot up one apical dominant top,
chop that fucker out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a nice bush, bushy, uh,
squatty plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, and it's, that one's kind of a
mess in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got a, uh, the branches are open,
but on the inside it's real branchy and
[SPEAKER_01]: leafy on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some structural terms,
uh, some visual descriptors we could talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would identify the structure,
uh, branchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said branchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nuketown has train wreck and the
lineage and the background somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that train wreck represents itself in
Nuketown as just massive branches going
[SPEAKER_01]: every direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you get the main branch going up,
then you get a lot of shit going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then off of those, you also get little
sub branches that most of the time we
[SPEAKER_01]: would cut off because they're just little
suckers and we lollipop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you leave those on the Nuketown,
they will make more buds and more freaking
[SPEAKER_01]: branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a branchy fucking plant in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a word I've used frequently also is
bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the red line, red line will go up and
then it'll start to go out, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you top red line and take out that main
top, it'll get bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it'll look like a shrub or a hedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just put two of them in front of
the front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll look like bushes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're greeting people with nice
bushes in front of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys understand bushy, the shrubs,
all this shit that you see the decorative
[SPEAKER_01]: shit out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, tall plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, a lot of my stuff, unfortunately I said
now tall and stretchy could be similar and
[SPEAKER_01]: different at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a tall plant with tight node
spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I talked about tight node spacing,
yeah, we're going to talk more about that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, tall plants and stretchy plants can be
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Jack, Jack Tripper will get stretchy,
but, uh, the John lemon will get tall and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a different thing because it stays
compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all gets tall where Jack Tripper is
fucking that top takes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The branches get out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's tall and stretchy are
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some plants grow very wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used the, uh, the red lion as an
example, that one, you might want to give
[SPEAKER_01]: it a little bit of extra space because it
wants to reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the machine, uh, soccer souffle,
those like to reach out just a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: and take up a little bit more space.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever grew my Prana, that was a
plant that liked more wide space more than
[SPEAKER_01]: it did the vertical space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is basically the frame and
structure that I'm talking about when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are more things to cover on this
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the next thing on my list is node
spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I touched on this a little bit ago when I
was talking about tight plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I mean by node spacing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got our main stock of our plant
and we've got branches coming off of that
[SPEAKER_01]: main stock by node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how far apart are those nodes and
also how far apart are those nodes on the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your main branch coming off
and you've got more branches and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: got more branch and more branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far apart is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pros and cons to far and close
structures like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your nodes are too close together,
then that, that plant may not work in a
[SPEAKER_01]: high humidity environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant may have a lot of problems
because there's going to be branches close
[SPEAKER_01]: together to leaves close together.
[SPEAKER_01]: High humidity may cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may want something a little more
open structured, a little less tight node
[SPEAKER_01]: spacing may be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the OG Kush type stuff has that
far apart node spacing, but the golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat has got really nice kind of tight
node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I breed that golden goat to
something kind of OG cushy, it comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: with a really nice frame and structure and
really nice appropriate node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too far apart to make the plant
stretchy and it's not too close together
[SPEAKER_01]: to give it problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really think the golden goat to older
stuff really makes a good structured and
[SPEAKER_01]: shaped plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I use the golden goat so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fixes up a lot of that stretchy
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of what I mean by node
spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far apart are the branches from the
main stock and also how far apart are the
[SPEAKER_01]: shoots and bud sites on those branches?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I mean by node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to think about that tells us
a lot about the plant is leaf shape and
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big are those leaves and what shape
are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they real skinny long leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they big fat leaves that you could
make a shade underneath?
[SPEAKER_01]: That leaf structure and size and shape
will tell you a lot about that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you a lot about how long it's
going to take to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those leaves are real huge,
you may have like an eight or nine week
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer and skinnier those leaves get,
the longer flowering plant you're
[SPEAKER_01]: generally going to have that usually does
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not a hard and fast rule of
thumb, but most of the time if you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: all your plants in the room, you go,
well, holy shit, that golden goat,
[SPEAKER_01]: that jack tripper has got them long skinny
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the longest flowering plant in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got Isabella, that's going to be
long skinny gigantic leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be one of the longest
flowering plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got some of the old daybreaker
crosses I made, those make giant leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They finish up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll notice that leaf shape will give
you a huge indication of how long that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is going to need to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I talk about sturdy or wispy
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge indicator that definitely
lies into structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sturdy, are the plants sturdy or are they
wispy and shitty?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice a lot of those OG cushions,
they can be kind of wispy and shitty and
[SPEAKER_01]: need a lot of supports, but things that
have been bred with the golden goat,
[SPEAKER_01]: the golden goat itself, a lot of the jack
the ripper crosses, those are very sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The platinum tangy, all the tangy crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange gas, it'll just hold itself right
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will salute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got sturdy branching versus
wispy branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some plants that make that a
real woody sort of a structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are just genetically will make that
woody structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will make a real soft green plush
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those both have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those do fall into structure when I'm
talking about structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nug formation, flower cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants, those OG cushions I've been
talking about, are going to make golf ball
[SPEAKER_01]: buds up that stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just going to have a golf ball,
then six inches, three inches up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be a golf ball and then a golf
ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get bigger as they get to the top
of the plant and those golf balls
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully will turn into a nice cola at
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those OG cushions are going to make
your golf ball type structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then some of the other stuff, I'm just
going to use golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get that big donkey dick
baseball bat type of structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I've got plants like grateful dog
that make acorn style buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're silver and purple and they look
like big acorns or just triangles all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have different bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you're going to have real dense,
real tight buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you're going to have open
fingery, possibly foxtail type of buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just all about the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phenotype, the genetics of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Colors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colors, that's what colors the damn plants
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aromas, that's what you think it smells
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll tell people this smells
like bubble gum and they'll tell me I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's subjective, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it smells like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give a couple of examples like
I did earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tall plant, lemon jeffery, would qualify
as a tall plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the Jack the Ripper crosses will
qualify as tall plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Branchy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuketown qualifies as a very branchy
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The double dragon is a branchy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble goat, some of those bubble goat
phenotypes have that open structure that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real classic Christmas tree
looking sort of a shape, real easy to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The orangegasm, that is a tall plant with
a tight structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some examples of some of my
plants and the structures that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just a few examples from strains
in my lineup that I can tell you about the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you're going to get
phenotypical variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different lighting is going to give you
different amounts of stretch and different
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of height.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you feed your environment will
play into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is generally what you can expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guideline is just basically what
I call the basic structures of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That open structure, that tight structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drive through Cali, you'll be able
to tell these differences out there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fields real easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's those super tall, tall sativa
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be out there for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are what I call the tall stretchier
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those tight plants that look like a big
shrub in a bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are tight, bushy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start understanding how I'm
describing it, start just looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will all become obvious to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my dude Dylan, this was a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me rambling for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, make sure you check your email
because I do owe you a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of iREGENETICS premium seeds.

[SPEAKER_01]: There's pictures of the testers that are
happening in progress now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a Smoker's Lounge where
I'm probably hanging out taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not on the podcast, if I'm not out
having fun, I'm usually signed into the
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoker's Lounge just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come chat with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cool people in there that
know a lot about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just also a lot of fun to hang out
with.
