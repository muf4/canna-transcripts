[SPEAKER_00]: Alright in a recent episode I did talk
about having what I was calling tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: swings I was mentioning that sometimes I
can buy a gram of concentrates and let's
[SPEAKER_00]: be real I never buy a gram of concentrates
I always buy several grams of concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just be honest with each other here
but when I buy concentrates sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: get home and I smoke a gram of
concentrates and I'm like I really wish I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have gotten a better buzz and it has
nothing to do with the concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm buying the same brand all the
time I prefer a certain brand I like a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain little range of flavors which they
offer so the concentrates are consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: then there will be some days when I can
open up that same jar of concentrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: take just you know like a maybe a 0.25
maybe a 0.2 of a gram of a dab out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and just be completely obliterated
my eyes get heavy they get red time starts
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling funny I can't remember what the
fuck I was thinking about so I have what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call drastic tolerance swings one day I
can look at the jar of dabs and get
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking wrecked one day I can smoke the
whole jar of dabs all of the dabs and not
[SPEAKER_00]: get a proper buzz there are several things
that I think contribute to that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are health-wise I realized maybe I
was catching a cold when I was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that super low tolerance time period for a
week there had a little bit of a sniffle
[SPEAKER_00]: that was rude to do into the microphone
but it was a good example I was getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a sniffle there I noticed I
was taking a nap more than usual so I may
[SPEAKER_00]: have been fighting off a little bit of a
cold that may have been affecting my
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tolerance just getting extra high
because there were other things happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in my body also I've noticed my levels of
hydration have a lot to do with how buzzed
[SPEAKER_00]: I get from sometimes the dabs make me more
lazy than they will give me a nice head
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz so a lot of it has to do with diet
with my intake with my other things I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into my body what I'm reacting
with responding to hydration is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: major issues in my dab ability if I'm not
properly hydrated I can't take a big dab
[SPEAKER_00]: because my lungs say bro what are you
doing if I'm well hydrated if I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: several glasses or bottles of water today
and I take a big fat dab my lungs go yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: dude you're nice and hydrated you can use
that dryness into your lungs and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a big deal so a lot of it is
physical a lot of it is what I'm putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into my body to go along with the dabs to
prepare for the dabs and recover from the
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent dabs another thing that people
chimed in with the most common response
[SPEAKER_00]: and reaction and comment was company have
a lot to do with your dabs in your
[SPEAKER_00]: response to consuming cannabis when you're
by yourself and you smoke or you eat
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles you don't have anybody to look
over and go dude are you as fucking high
[SPEAKER_00]: as me or dude did you even get anything
off of those edibles you don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have anybody to ask anybody to
laugh at or compare it to or to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: hints it's just you trying to figure life
out you may not even notice and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna segue into the next part here you
might not even notice how high you are
[SPEAKER_00]: until you change your environment a lot of
people said environment and setting have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to do with your buzz your and your
environment will give you a phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: expression on your buzz that's just a grow
room joke but environment and setting have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot to do with that I've noticed if I
dab right here or if I dab in the other
[SPEAKER_00]: office space which you guys are familiar
with if you've seen my live videos or seen
[SPEAKER_00]: me on other shows I've got another office
space in which I frequently take dabs and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out do recordings in there if I hang
out in those spaces my tolerance is
[SPEAKER_00]: unlimited because I don't have to do
anything except to deal with my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: space I know where this microphone is I
know where this table is this chair is
[SPEAKER_00]: secure I'm safe in my office space I've
got a nice chill super comfy office chair
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the music I can imagine I got
a nice sound setup in there I've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: air pods in my ears there's a couch in
there nothing could go wrong there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: change of clothes in there there are a
bunch of sneakers it's a chill place
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing could go wrong in my little chill
areas so sometimes I'll take a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs and for the sake of telling a story
that a lot of people are gonna listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll call my uber driver and they'll come
pick me up as soon as I get in that uber I
[SPEAKER_00]: think to myself holy shit I'm high as fuck
but when I was chilling in the office or
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling at the recording studio space I
didn't even notice how buzzed I was I was
[SPEAKER_00]: cool everything was going just fine and
then I walked outside and felt that
[SPEAKER_00]: outside air hit my skin and I went oh shit
and the neighbor across the way said
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up Rasta Jeff and I went hey bro
and realized I'm talking in slow motion
[SPEAKER_00]: and hearing in 3d and then again the uber
and the uber drivers like where you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like I don't fucking know dude I'd
type that in a minute ago and I already
[SPEAKER_00]: forgot where are you taking me like you
don't realize until you change your
[SPEAKER_00]: setting and your environment and then you
get somewhere how many times have you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought you were cool maybe you go
somewhere and allegedly hypothetically you
[SPEAKER_00]: drive to and I'm just gonna say in high
school back in the day where I'm from we
[SPEAKER_00]: all went to the mall I like to go hit the
mall on Saturdays and buy some sneakers go
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there's any new sneaker drops so
sometimes allegedly you drive to the mall
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to the mall parking lot you roll a
fat one up or maybe you burn it on the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the mall whatever you do right you
smoke on the way to the mall and you think
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm legit you get out of the car the cloud
comes out of the car you all giggle you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking put in eye drops like nobody's
gonna notice that all six of you are
[SPEAKER_00]: walking around smelling like a fucking
dispensary in the mall giggling at stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: shit looking stoned in there you think
you're getting away with it but it's cool
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway you walk into the mall and then you
realize oh my goodness there are people in
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there are stores and there are
lights and I'm so high that it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable but it's really fun because
I like that sort of a thing I've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I change my setting my
environment my surroundings I really get a
[SPEAKER_00]: different buzz I've noticed that when we
used to go to city council meetings I
[SPEAKER_00]: would get the most paranoid weird anxiety
ridden buzz and it was cool because I
[SPEAKER_00]: could have cannabis you weren't supposed
to take it in there but I mean I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: around cannabis I could be stoned I was a
medical cannabis patient they're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about medical cannabis I was definitely
consuming between work and the meetings so
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going in and they knew that I
smelled like cannabis and looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and for some reason that buzz was
just so fucking nerve-wracking being in
[SPEAKER_00]: there super high I probably would not have
enjoyed it as much it probably would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been even more nerve-wracking if I wasn't
nice and blazed so then there are places
[SPEAKER_00]: that I go that I feel just totally fucking
I don't even notice that I'm blazed once I
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the dispensary I'm like what's up
guys and gals cuz my friends work at all
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensaries where I shop and I'm just
hanging out with my bros hanging out with
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends I gotta show my ID and give
them money but we all know each other we
[SPEAKER_00]: say what's up it's a fist bump situation
so when I'm at the dispensary I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: notice how buzzed I am get back in the car
to drive in the get in the uber again to
[SPEAKER_00]: get back home and then I'm like dude
you're going too fast and he's like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: parked bro like it's just all about
setting scenario location that is a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing factor to the buzz which I
feel like a lot of us receive who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: with imagine if you're smoking with me
some people and not to sound that way some
[SPEAKER_00]: people do meet me and smoke with me and
act all star-struck and weird that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really funny to me but then smoking with
me you've got nothing to worry about like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the cops I'm not Babylon I'm not
your mom I'm not your lawyer I'm not your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor we're gonna smoke dads and we're
gonna have a good ass time I don't care
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do once we get stoned do your
thing we're gonna have fun be weird eat
[SPEAKER_00]: snacks say strange things stare off into
space I expect it from you I got you too
[SPEAKER_00]: damn high then imagine smoking dads with
your doctor you're gonna get a really
[SPEAKER_00]: weird buzz it's gonna be kind of fucking
strange if you got a cool lawyer you might
[SPEAKER_00]: get to smoke some data through your lawyer
but it's all about who and where what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking sometimes in the car you
got that little protective bubble as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as you get out of the car you're not in
that bubble life is weird out there it's
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of environment you think you're fine
till you pull up to the drive-thru window
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to order you guys be careful if
you're smoking in the car these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: just hypothetical funny ideas that I may
or may not have experienced in my high
[SPEAKER_00]: school days another thing that heavily in
my opinion contributes to the buzz which I
[SPEAKER_00]: receive can from consuming my cannabis is
not only the product the product is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a huge factor I've said that
I've got my favorite brands I've got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: brands I really select and support none of
them sponsor the show they don't pay me to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about them I just like to buy the
products because they taste good they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke well they give me a good buzz most
of the time I buy green dot labs the live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter part of the time I buy the Binsk
batter because it tastes good and it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: me a nice buzz there are a couple more
that I'll buy just in the periphery if
[SPEAKER_00]: those are ran out or sold out or whatever
but that's what I prefer those products
[SPEAKER_00]: give me a nice buzz if I get something and
I like the batters when I smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: diamonds the buzz comes on real fast real
strong it's more of a head sweat fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: bug-eyed sort of a thing sometimes that's
what I'm after so that's a different sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a buzz the product is what I'm talking
about shatter gives me a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different buzz than the diamonds the sauce
or the batter smoke and flour is a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different buzz I like to carry
a pipe around when I'm doing chores around
[SPEAKER_00]: the house if I'm just cleaning up if I'm
cooking food if I'm cleaning up from
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking food if I'm chopping vegetables
just got a pipe sitting there and I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking take a rip off the pipe there's
usually a pipe within reach just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little security blanket just to keep the
little buzz going it doesn't give me what
[SPEAKER_00]: I need from a dab but it'll make the dab
last a little longer so the product and
[SPEAKER_00]: then what I was gonna get to next is the
device my favorite rig I'm gonna say that
[SPEAKER_00]: sentence again because I feel like I
slurred that one all out my favorite rig
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me a completely different buzz than
my non-favorite rig my first place rig
[SPEAKER_00]: hits way better than my second place rig I
love my second third place rigs I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of rigs but my first place rig is
first place for a reason something about
[SPEAKER_00]: the ritual of the way it fits in my hand
the way the mouthpiece fits against my
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth the way that the carb cap reaches
the way that the dabber reaches it's far
[SPEAKER_00]: enough away from my eyes so I don't look
cross-eyed trying to get the dabber into
[SPEAKER_00]: the banger then when I go to carb cap it
it's not too far away from my face but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not so big that it's cumbersome my
rig is my favorite rig and it gives me the
[SPEAKER_00]: most beautiful hits I know that rig I know
how hard to pull I know how hard to draw I
[SPEAKER_00]: know how long to draw I know how to wiggle
the carb cap I know exactly how much water
[SPEAKER_00]: to put into it I know when I've bitten off
more than I can chew and I should stop
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling so hard or pull a little bit
harder with that rig that rig is my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite and I talk about her a lot I show
it off a lot I'll pop a picture in right
[SPEAKER_00]: now so that you guys can see the rig I'm
talking about but that's the rig I love to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit it feels really nice on my lungs gives
me a good dab when I hit other rigs
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I don't even feel like I got a
nice hit got a nice buzz because I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: ah this rig sucks or whatever the nail is
too small the mouthpiece is shaped funny I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like the little peepee shaped
mouthpiece if it's like a I have a peepee
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped if it's phallic shaped and it's got
the little hole in it and I have to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: kissy shaped face to hit it I feel like
the size dabs I take I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate built up on the kissy face
part of my lips and my lips get all sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: and they get all red and I look all weird
and then I walk around doing this for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next 20 minutes with my lips I'm just
going because I got that sticky shit on my
[SPEAKER_00]: lips and act like a little kid don't know
what the fuck to do with it so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like the peepee shaped tapered skinny
skinny mouth rigs I prefer a flared out
[SPEAKER_00]: trumpet mouthpiece style rig that I can
just put over my mouth and then I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that the smoke is getting in there and I
don't have to make that duck face peepee
[SPEAKER_00]: suck face whatever face you're talking
about so sometimes somebody's rig I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take a dab of really quality concentrates
and I know it's a fat dab and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: where'd all that smoke go where's my dab
dude what happened and I don't know their
[SPEAKER_00]: nail I don't know their carb cap I don't
know their rig and so the nail is too hot
[SPEAKER_00]: or too cold I don't cap it properly I
don't hit it at the right time and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also the rig just sucks it doesn't bubble
right there's too much too little water in
[SPEAKER_00]: there I don't feel like I got a good dab
then occasionally I'm gonna I'm gonna give
[SPEAKER_00]: praise right after I complain just because
this does happen too in reality in life
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally somebody will hand me a dab
and a rig I'll be like you want to hit my
[SPEAKER_00]: new rig and I'll be like that looks all
fancy and I'll go in to take a hit and
[SPEAKER_00]: that rig will uppercut me in the dick and
it will be one of the best dabs I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: had so it's kind of unpredictable
sometimes with the rig depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the rig the quality of the rig
who made the rig has a lot to do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some makers out there they're
really focused on getting a good fat rip
[SPEAKER_00]: some people want to and this is all
opinion based some people in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: like or want too many bubbles and spinnies
and functions and twists and turns and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking fancy ways for the water to go and
drains and spouts and twisties and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: twisty too many times but they want all
these directions and cool flows and
[SPEAKER_00]: recycles and end cycles and out cycles and
donuts and shit that's cool but in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion every one of those twists turns
ends outs steals a little bit of my dad it
[SPEAKER_00]: steals the airflow it steals the the turps
it steals the resin and it's more to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: just not for me I like a dab that goes
from the banger to the water to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: cools off a little bit doesn't splash me
in my mouth and then into my brain so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just like dab and uppercut oh I'm
stoned that's what I want from it so I got
[SPEAKER_00]: off on a huge ramble on there but the rig
the fucking setting the environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: rig has a lot to do with it in my opinion
is where I was headed a lot of people like
[SPEAKER_00]: a really ornate rig I prefer a simple rig
punch me in the face get me going so who
[SPEAKER_00]: you're hanging out with will have a lot to
do with it if you smoke with me or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke with your fucking lawyer or if you
smoke with the judge probably gonna cop a
[SPEAKER_00]: different buzz environment if you're
smoking before you go into a rock concert
[SPEAKER_00]: or a dispensary totally chill you
shouldn't be paranoid at all if you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go into court or walk into the
bank you're probably gonna get the sweats
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably gonna get the armpit
sweats and a little bit of anxiety it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all about setting it's all about where
you're going then also the rig and the
[SPEAKER_00]: product are gonna have a lot to do with
the buzz then what you've eaten what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've consumed your physical health your
mental health are going to have a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with how that buzz comes onto you came
from the same person so with less rambling
[SPEAKER_00]: a little less talk a little more action
let's jump into the first one it says here
[SPEAKER_00]: is a question for you Rasta Jeff sometimes
I hear you talk about rubbing the stems of
[SPEAKER_00]: the male plant as you describe the odors
in very vivid and graphic terms yes some
[SPEAKER_00]: of my terms are very graphic then it says
are we to take from this that terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles are male dominant traits so let's
talk about this question when I do talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about selecting male plants and also
female plants I like to rub the stem of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant the stock of the plants you got
the fucking base of the plant and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipop that probably a few inches and
then the branches come up and whatever a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times I'll just grab that naked
stock of the plant just pinch it with my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers and rub it give it a little a
little rub and tug and then smell my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers and I notice a lot in those aromas
they come off of there that's not what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to smell like when it's
finished that's not what the final product
[SPEAKER_00]: will smell like but it tells me a little
bit of what the ingredients I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: with now smell like and from experience
from being a breeder that's done this a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot I know what the now flavor the now
smell will turn into later and what it
[SPEAKER_00]: translates to into the breeding project so
I know that in my opinion a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that smells acrid like vomit like bar
trash can like that fermented bar trash
[SPEAKER_00]: can if you've ever had to take out the
trash at the bar if you've ever taken out
[SPEAKER_00]: the trash at the bowling alley or
somewhere that's serves booze and food
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this acrid smell on the bottom of
the trash can that's just it's fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: it's funky it's putrid that smell in a
male plant translates to gassy funky burnt
[SPEAKER_00]: rubber tennis ball cushy stanky aromas
when you breed with that plant so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I talk about rubbing the male of the
plant I give it a little rub and tug
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up smell my fingers and observe
what I've smelled then try to hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers with rubbing alcohol get all that
smell off of there rub them on your jeans
[SPEAKER_00]: or on your khakis real hard use your other
hand smell another plant then clean that
[SPEAKER_00]: hand again and then hopefully by now the
turps are gone from both hands you go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and repeat the process you could smell a
few plants and see what you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with one will fucking stand out even if
you don't clean your fingers enough one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them will make you go oh go with your
heart go with your body go with your your
[SPEAKER_00]: senses that's like your your body knows
when you need something desire something
[SPEAKER_00]: wants something when something's gonna
work for you when you smell oranges you go
[SPEAKER_00]: that smells good because there's vitamins
in there when you smell poop your body
[SPEAKER_00]: goes I probably shouldn't eat that because
that's waste we've got pro we're
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed to know what our body wants to
go with the one that your nose tells you
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with I did a podcast maybe six years
ago that's called follow your nose because
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose always knows that's what you can
Sam taught us and it's still accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: follow your nose because your nose is one
of your biggest receptors they could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: your body what's good for you and what's
bad for you like I just said oranges smell
[SPEAKER_00]: good for a reason poo poo smells bad for a
reason now the question is are we to take
[SPEAKER_00]: from this that terpenes are male dominant
traits no that is not what I mean by that
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know what that male trait delivers
to the mix and I know that I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: success using that ingredient so a lot of
our when you're chefing you need to use
[SPEAKER_00]: butter and cream or two other things I
can't think of right now that would mix
[SPEAKER_00]: well but butter and cream mix well every
fucking time right or salt and cream I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking that up all up anyway you gotta
salt the cream right so if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that fucking you can always count on
that male plant that smells like puke to
[SPEAKER_00]: be your cream it's always gonna work with
most things or it's always gonna be your
[SPEAKER_00]: your butter you can butter up almost
everything it's always gonna work so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it's just chefing in my opinion
I've had good that may have been a
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible fucking analogy I may have lost
everybody with that but you know me so I
[SPEAKER_00]: just think that it's like chefing and I
know that that's a good starter that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good base that's a good color palette to
bust out to start with it will mix well
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of things it will complement a
lot of things that muted puke flavor is
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of on the darker grayer side if
you think in colors and if you mix it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pinks and blues which you get from
like strawberry blueberry oranges which
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd get from orange flavored turps it
allows them to mingle very well together
[SPEAKER_00]: then you get that dark color with the
lighter color and it brings out the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of both worlds that's a little view into
my weird thought process on colors and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and chefing and creating strains I
just know that that puke flavored trait
[SPEAKER_00]: evolves or translates into good things in
the future I know that if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant that smells acrid and sour that
you get that weird swampy cushy flavor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end if it's got berries at the start
it's gonna have way too much berries in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor in the end that's just
something I know from working with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of male plants so rub those males rub the
females see what they work see what they
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like see what they turn into once
you work with them a few times you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with it you'll say when it smells
like berries at the start when it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: this watermelon smell or strawberry smell
at the beginning it turns into grapefruits
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end or something you'll notice that
you'll start to learn that that's just all
[SPEAKER_00]: from growing the same plants over and over
and over again all right thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: that great question my friend I'm gonna
move on to the next question on my cards
[SPEAKER_00]: here it says Rasta Jeff thank you for
sharing sharing your unique talent have
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever included cow manure compost or
mushroom compost in your soil mixes do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an opinion one way or the other and I
just simply replied with no because that
[SPEAKER_00]: is not my style I buy cocoa I buy perlite
and I mix cocoa and perlite together and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's generally my mix for a commercial
grow in my personal grows I honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate from something like a roots
organics or the 707 mix sometimes I buy
[SPEAKER_00]: what's it called fertile loom and the red
bag then I put a lot of perlite in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I buy what is the other in Fox
Farms ocean forest I buy right now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hard to get a lot of soil because
things are limited because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: situations we're in so I get what is
available and I believe that since I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding my plants with such good nutrients
I mainly use new millennium bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients with a couple of additives
there's some bud swell in there there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some green sensation in there there's a
little bit of veg bloom products in there
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the shine but I'm mainly using high
quality inputs so as long as I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: good substrate for my plants to hang out
and the roots to be in as long as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding them while I'm not super picky
about my soil or my medium as long as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fluffy and it's well aerated and
it's a good quality and it's clean then
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I'm using but I usually don't
use any sort of compost no manure or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that I live in the city my
neighbors are close I don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: space a lot of yard space a lot of room
for like composting and shit like that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just got a lot of storage and shit like
that taking up all my space so if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not my style so no never done that
probably won't do that just not the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I grow more of a commercial grower
with a different mindset doing things a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a different way the next
weird question that I got was is your real
[SPEAKER_00]: name Jeff yeah the name is Jeff I am the
lemon Jeffrey I'm the Jeff behind a lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey that's why I was named lemon
Jeffrey that's me bro Ross oh god I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: even editing that out Rasta Jeff lemon
Jeff that's where all the Jeff stuff comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from yes the name is Jeff real names
Jeffrey if you want to get technical all
[SPEAKER_00]: right what about old bottles of nutrients
I have unopened quartz of Cal Mag and
[SPEAKER_00]: containers of great white that are three
or more years old should I flush them into
[SPEAKER_00]: my septic tank there's a lot to unpack in
that question a lot of your products
[SPEAKER_00]: should have an expiration date printed on
them if you look on the lid or on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the bottle somewhere there
should be an expiration date I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what those companies recommend for storage
for long-term use if they're more than a
[SPEAKER_00]: year old I generally get rid of them the
quartz of Cal Mag I would open up and
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it see what it smells like if it
smells like Cal Mag should if you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: using Cal Mag for a while you know what it
smells like it smells like Cal Mag like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of Cal Mag it's got a very distinct
smell to it when you get it on your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers you smell it all day it's not
terrible but it's got a very a very
[SPEAKER_00]: noticeable aroma smell them see if they're
okay I would consider using the Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe if it's past its expiration date but
if you can toss it and get another one if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's affordable I would just do that don't
risk it if it's chunky if it smells bad
[SPEAKER_00]: then toss it immediately check for an
expiration date the great white um I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how hot or cold you've had those
stored I don't know how dry or moist in
[SPEAKER_00]: which the environment in which those were
stored has been but if it hasn't changed
[SPEAKER_00]: colors I think it starts off like a
whitish gray if it hasn't turned purple or
[SPEAKER_00]: too dark and it hasn't clumped up and
gotten chunky it's probably okay to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the good thing is if you use that product
and it is expired you're probably good not
[SPEAKER_00]: let me try to fucking get my tongue under
control here you're probably not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause any harm by using that product
should it be expired you've just got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of dead microbes it'll just be a
bunch of inert matter that'll just be just
[SPEAKER_00]: sand basically floating around in your
water when you mix it in so I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be a problem if you do attempt
to use it however I would look for a an
[SPEAKER_00]: expiration date on both of those maybe I
do not work for those companies I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say maybe contact the vendors the
manufacturers and see how long they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you keep them around if they
were in a cool dry dark safe environment
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they'll last a little longer if you
had adverse conditions extremes of one end
[SPEAKER_00]: or the other they're probably toast and I
would consider getting rid of them if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can afford it toss them out get some fresh
shit not talking trash about your budget I
[SPEAKER_00]: know everybody has shit tightened down
right now because of the pandemic because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the situation in which we are all
facing so I don't really have any solid
[SPEAKER_00]: advice for you contact the vendors or
check out the products if the dried
[SPEAKER_00]: products have become purple or chunky and
dried up and stuck together I would toss
[SPEAKER_00]: that if it's gummy I would definitely toss
that if the other product is chunky as
[SPEAKER_00]: well smells bad if they smell bad don't
use them get rid of them contact the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors see what they say look for that
expiration date here's another question I
[SPEAKER_00]: found to be kind of funny this is not grow
related this is just random it says what
[SPEAKER_00]: did Walmart do to piss you off I did not
know that I had expressed anywhere that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had any sort of hatred or anger toward
Walmart but I just thought this was funny
[SPEAKER_00]: it was something I could just address
really quickly I do try to answer all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the patreon questions and this one came in
so I'm standing by my word and doing my
[SPEAKER_00]: best to answer this and it could be real
quick if I'd quit rambling about it what
[SPEAKER_00]: do Walmart do to piss me off nothing like
directly nothing like they didn't stab me
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't punch me I just don't like the
way that Walmart treats the community I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think that they're they're not it's
not cool man it's Babylon man they come to
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and they shut down mom-and-pop
stores and then they build the big Walmart
[SPEAKER_00]: store and then every three blocks you got
a Walmart neighborhood market and it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it hard for the small mom-and-shop
community stores stores yes those two to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay in business and survive and as a
small business myself I understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like we need to make ends meet we
need to pay our employees and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: handle things it's a struggle sometimes so
seeing Walmart crush things was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird and then if you want to get closer
to home my mom no longer works there so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could talk about it my mom worked at
Walmart and they didn't give a fuck about
[SPEAKER_00]: her I love my mom dearly she's the most
important person in my world in my life
[SPEAKER_00]: and Walmart treated my mom like shit so
watching somebody or a company or an
[SPEAKER_00]: entity treat somebody you love more than
anything that you wish you could solve all
[SPEAKER_00]: their problems and fucking just pay their
way for life to see that company treat my
[SPEAKER_00]: mama like shit that made me salty to be
quite honest with you she worked there for
[SPEAKER_00]: years it's you guys don't care about what
my mom did for Walmart my mom probably
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't want her business broadcasted out
but I feel like Walmart did her dirty so
[SPEAKER_00]: and not just one time I just feel like it
was a continued but continued fuck you
[SPEAKER_00]: from Walmart to her and to the family just
because the way they treated her she was a
[SPEAKER_00]: kick-ass employee I got my work ethic from
my mom and if you guys know me you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking work my ass off my mom will work
circles around me she's old enough to be
[SPEAKER_00]: my mama obviously and she will still
fucking work circles around me so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: salty at Walmart for treating my mom like
shit anybody that treats your mama like
[SPEAKER_00]: shit you're gonna have some hatred for I
don't know that it's hatred salty is the
[SPEAKER_00]: word if I can shop anywhere else I just go
there there's no need for me to give my
[SPEAKER_00]: money that I work for my mama works hard
for her money there's no need to spend my
[SPEAKER_00]: money at a company that doesn't give a
shit about the people that does kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sketchy shady things I should I should be
careful with what I'm saying because they
[SPEAKER_00]: may fucking delete my skew tag and I made
fucking disappear I may be taking that
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory and never fucking return here if
I keep talking so I just didn't like the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they treated my mom she doesn't work
there anymore so we can talk shit now they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't fire they can't do a fucking thing
but I just didn't like it so that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much why I'm salty on Walmart they didn't
do anything directly they just just a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of years of just fucking jabs just
being dicks like I don't know I just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't care for it that's not cool there's
probably better places to work and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: work for Walmart do your thing I
understand it's a pandemic get your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking paycheck but now man yeah I
wouldn't do it I wouldn't work there and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm privileged and blessed so I understand
things are different but that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart did to piss me off they was mean
to my mama and anybody that's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with my mama got a problem with me
kind of fucking joking mostly fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: serious so let's keep moving forward this
is a fun podcast I like these short
[SPEAKER_00]: questions this is a good Thursday show I
think this comes out on Thursday happy
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday y'all this one goes like this I'm
never gonna say y'all again either hey bro
[SPEAKER_00]: big fan with a big question is flash
photography bad for the plants could it go
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as making our plants turn into
hermaphrodites or express intersex traits
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think that flash photography is
bad for the plants during the lights on
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle don't disrupt the nighttime cycle
with flash photography that will probably
[SPEAKER_00]: piss them off you can think of it like
this what do you accept when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping you want it still dark and quiet
right shut the fuck up turn off the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't bother me that's what you want
when you're sleeping guess what that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what the plants want also they want to be
in a cool temperature a cool environment
[SPEAKER_00]: they just don't want to be fucked with
they want it dark they want it quiet they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be left the fuck alone if you go
if I walked into your bedroom when you
[SPEAKER_00]: fell asleep two or three hours after just
walk in there start going hey could I get
[SPEAKER_00]: you to maybe strike a pose bitch and start
taking pictures with flash photography
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna throw everything in reach at
me and I'm gonna have photos of it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be really funny I'm gonna post them
and tag you but fucking shit's gonna come
[SPEAKER_00]: flying to me from all directions your
glass of water you got by the bedside
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming the book you were reading
before bed that's coming if I haven't ran
[SPEAKER_00]: yet you're probably shooting at me by now
for taking flash photography of you trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to sleep you're probably in your undies
probably don't look your best probably all
[SPEAKER_00]: puffy-faced and fucking confused the
plants feel the same way don't go taking
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of the ladies in there don't take
any pictures of ladies in their sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you got their permission you guys
know ladies even none of the ladies all
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys out there listen to me no ladies
want you taking their pictures when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're asleep and that comes down to the
cannabis plants and all ladies in our
[SPEAKER_00]: lives don't do it skip that be a better
person than that that's partly a joke
[SPEAKER_00]: again again completely fucking serious
when they're awake let them get dressed up
[SPEAKER_00]: let them pose let them do their thing let
them be prepared and take all the flash
[SPEAKER_00]: photography you want I don't think flash
photography will harm the plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: daylight cycle in the nighttime cycle yes
you've got the potential to cause huge
[SPEAKER_00]: catastrophic problems with flash
photography in my opinion just because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're walking in there you probably got a
light on when you go in there you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: maneuver around the room you're taking
pictures you're looking at the camera
[SPEAKER_00]: screen probably using your phone for a
flashlight not even thinking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: being a light just take pictures when the
lights are on use your flash photography
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point they will be cool I don't
think that'll make them harm I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: going for a long time I've got one more
question we're gonna finish this page of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions then we'll wrap up this random
questions episode this one says another
[SPEAKER_00]: soil question for you hey Rasta Jeff I
know you've worked at a commercial grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: your youth that's funny in my youth in my
youth I was a shithead most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial growing has been as an adult
but thank you I appreciate that maybe I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still in my youth fuck yeah still in my
youth anyway it says with all of the craft
[SPEAKER_00]: breweries in Colorado have you ever heard
of anyone making a soil blend containing a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of spent barley grains from the
brewery then they sign their name I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if they want their name said I did
not ask I did not verify clarify or
[SPEAKER_00]: confirm or deny so I'm not gonna say that
but let's answer the question um I have
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard of that honestly I'm sure it's
happening somewhere I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in a commercial grow because
there's probably some stupid rule that
[SPEAKER_00]: bans the brewery from giving out that
spent stuff and another stupid rule that
[SPEAKER_00]: would ban the commercial grow from
accepting that spent stuff honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably some logistics that put a
big piece of red tape from allowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen that's just how both of those
industries work they're both highly overly
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated and there would just be I'd
probably have to pay a million dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy it and then probably they have to
spend a fucking million dollars just to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it to me only the governmenting and
the governing agencies would make the two
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars both of us would be fucked
out of money that's just how the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: works in commercial cannabis and
commercial alcohol production so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know anybody doing that that's my
assumption by the way once again bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science bro news bro info I don't know
anybody doing it never heard of it done is
[SPEAKER_00]: that a good idea containing a percentage
of barley grains from the brewery I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know I never thought of that never heard
of that idea that's a new one for me but
[SPEAKER_00]: very creative and thank you for the the
podcast content all right I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I'm gonna go with all these
random questions that I've printed out
[SPEAKER_00]: here this was a fun episode I had a good
