[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This of course is episode 796 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've teamed up with our friends at
SeedsHereNow.com to give away a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that later in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I do want to
announce that I was on the Dude Grow Show
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
that Dude Grow Show episode will be out
[SPEAKER_00]: and available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to YouTube, search for Dude Grow
Show with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you listen, watch that video,
give it some likes, leave some comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them know that you loved me on the
show so they will have me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of the Dude Grow's, the Dude
Grow's Cup is happening again June 3rd
[SPEAKER_00]: just outside of Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out DGCCUP.com for all
of that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hanging out with the Dude Grow's and
they said that event is more than halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need your tickets, get them now
because it will sell out and I look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to seeing you at the Dude Grow's
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team iry genetics will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have all kinds of great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're not shopping for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come by say hi, give me a fist bump,
give me a high five, give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a photo with me if that's what you're
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy seeds to come hang
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite everybody to come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're looking for seeds,
definitely make sure you come by the
[SPEAKER_00]: booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that's all of the
business we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, there's one more thing to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: More business here at the start of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a sale running on irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab some regular femini seeds at great
prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put some of the fem seeds down to
ridiculous prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the regular seeds are at
ridiculous prices and every order does
[SPEAKER_00]: come with free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sale does last through this entire
month of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out irydirect and
catch that sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your garden started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now we are through all of the
business part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to jump into the email and grow
question portion of today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question comes from the grow
help tab on the iry genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to irygenetics.com, there's a
list of tabs at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them says does say questions or
grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're smart enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that a click.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ask you a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It asks you about your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to ask you where you're growing
indoors, outdoors, what strain are you
[SPEAKER_00]: growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the temp?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask a few basic questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets me get a heads up on how to help
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I know about your grow,
the easier it is for me to diagnose,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct and set you up for success and
help you with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: After those general questions,
we do give you the opportunity to type in
[SPEAKER_00]: your full question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend J H has sent me a question on
the grow help tab and it goes a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, can you tell me about your
easiest to grow strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I can really hit out of the park
without being an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many goes in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says and don't say all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny because all of my
strains are pretty easy to grow and you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to bang them all out of the
park.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will give you some specifics and
some more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what one of your strains is the
healthiest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which strain can't and won't be stopped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which strain is beginner friendly and what
strain is resistant to all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they ask follow up questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I determine all the answers for
these, they want to know what does it
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the flowering time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what type of morphology can we expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are there more on the list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he follows up with another great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the first part of this
question here from our friend J H in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main part of the question is which of
my strains are easiest to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said don't say all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does limit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often say that Sunkiss is one of my
easiest to grow strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss is super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a mistake, if you over water,
under water, over feed, under feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sunkiss doesn't get too upset about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take some abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take some grower error and a new
grower is going to make some errors and
[SPEAKER_00]: cause some abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunkiss is always one of my very first
recommendations when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: successful plants for a beginner grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend the strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only issue with strawberry starburst
is it may get a little bit tall for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower if they are not prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good side to that is it does grow
super quickly and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows with hypervigorous water and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't take nearly as much
flowering time to get that plant big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and ready for flower because it
just grows so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your veg time is shorter, which gives
you less time for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the quicker in and out we are
in that grow in that garden, the less
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity we have for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a quicker vegging plant will definitely
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, those will get quite tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flip early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a longer list here of things
that I think will grow well in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: from my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew is a great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very resistant to powdery mildew,
very resistant to bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great structure and it's super
stinky and super potent product in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Sunkiss strawberry starburst and
morning dew are three of the classics that
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have been in my lineup for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tried and true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they work well in all types of
environments, indoors, outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work well for experienced growers and
they definitely work well for the noobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen new growers push that strawberry
starburst to beautiful limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some gorgeous pictures of
strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morning dew comes out super frosty,
super chunky, no matter who grows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Sunkiss is just autopilot weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pour water and nutrients on that
and put lights above it, Sunkiss is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you an excellent, amazing top
shelf buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going because there are more
to the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mention fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump is one of my newer strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump is super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a sour diesel to a rise cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the only problem you may run
into with fist bump is it is going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly tall fairly quickly and it may need
some sort of supports, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to grow in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's make it real easy for people
and let's talk about some feminized lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do offer that make it very easy for
people to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites that I recommend for
new growers that you guys love that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody out there is able to grow,
able to knock it out of the park is Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a little extra feeding,
but most new growers tend to overfeed
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since the Golden Goat needs a little
extra nutrients, you guys do it just
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new growers do that one very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get seeds from me, if it says femme
seeds on it, there is a Golden Goat back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are Golden Goat feminized
seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have all female plants in your
lineup that will grow with great vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be nice and sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make beautiful plants with great
colors, great aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take about eight and a half to nine
and a half weeks to finish, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and the phenotypical expressions
you achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which plants you get out of the seed pack,
basically, but it's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buzz from Golden Goat is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavors, aromas and buzz are top
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I breed it to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice there's Golden Goat
somewhere in a lot of my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: More feminized stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maize and the wombat maize and wombat
are great strains for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will work very well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also character zero and Sunday show will
be great strains for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all four of those are feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maize, wombat, Sunday show and
character zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will all grow very well for a new
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all very resistant to problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mildew, the mold, bugs, all of those
will be very resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with those last four that I
mentioned is they do get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only issue to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing to do there, flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't veg them for so long, which most
growers are pretty eager to get the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do want to flower early, so veg them
till they're about maybe knee high,
[SPEAKER_00]: then flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll do really well with those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me review that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular seeds, sun kiss, strawberry
starburst, morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we work into fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump is going to be super stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have carbon filtration in
place for the fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize, wombat, character zero and Sunday
show are very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great growing plant is the lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it does get really tall and it's
kind of picky on feeding inside some
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to really push yourself,
try the lemon Jeff, but that's the next
[SPEAKER_00]: step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's not going to be as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of my easiest and
healthiest to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can't stop, won't be stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all beginner friendly and they're
all quite resistant to most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems you're going to run into as a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the flavors
and aromas of a lot of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is straight up oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for oranges,
orange candy, orange funk, sun kiss is the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew, is straight funky,
skunky, earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it warmer notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more earthy, skunky,
gassy, or darker sort of tones in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just straight up strawberry candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fuely, offensive gas,
funky, diesel fuel, gasoline sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat is kind of like a tropical
fruit, tropical fruit basket and juicy
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion of Golden Goat and I
love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize is blue raspberry truffle to the
afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that blue raspberry truffle
sort of, sort of, it's like a raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sour, tangy sort of a thing,
but then that mixes in with the sweetness
[SPEAKER_00]: of the afterglow and it makes amazing
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wombat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the New York City diesel to
afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get hints of that diesel flavor and a
lot of orange diesel-y terps out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Character zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's going to give you those earthy,
terpy, more earthy, terpy sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Sunday show, that's also
going to give you cushy, orange sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the flavors and aromas from
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight or nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight or nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine or ten weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine to ten weeks on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wombat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Character zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all going to be nine to ten
weekers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find some early finishers and the
Sunkiss and Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those will go eight weeks,
56 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish the eighth week, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut it down the middle of week
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let 56 days happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend 60 days, but some of
those are a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since a lot of these came from the
Arise pollen donor, King Solomon,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them have that tall, branchy,
takeoff sort of structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that doesn't do it as much is
Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss doesn't take off as hard as the
others, but most of them will get a tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny sort of a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one should say, depending on your
light and your environment, sometimes it
[SPEAKER_00]: stays a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it does a little stretching for
people, but it's shorter and bushier for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wombat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Character zero and Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to get tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see tall, stretchy plants
with a lot of branches, but in flower all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that tallness just fills up with meaty,
beefy, chunky, trichome covered nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really going to dig too deep into
the specific phenotypes of all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you the basic what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one, two, that's like the top
10 in my lineup right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't pick just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like trying to pick your favorite
pair of sneakers, but those are a few that
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend for a new beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd really kick some good ass
with morning dew, fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on that list is great to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it said, are all of your strains
potent?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everything that I breed potent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm using, I do very careful
selection for male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm using top quality male plants,
that leads me to think that most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny should be quite potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should contain a lot of THC potential,
but that's also up to the grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which phenotype did you select?
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be other terpenes or
cannabinoids dominating that mix to where
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC isn't the most potent,
most prevalent compound in that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it'll still be a very potent plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what you're looking for,
it depends on also how did you grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are a lot of other things that
come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it dried and cured properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the strain for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, in most cases, the things that I
bred, the things that I breed and create
[SPEAKER_00]: should be quite potent because I'm smoking
for more of a head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to walk into the store and almost
have a panic attack and think,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh shit, I'm way too high to be in here
shopping and consider leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the buzz that I am seeking to
achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do breed for that sort of head buzz
sort of panicky sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some more cushy variety
stuff coming from me in the future here
[SPEAKER_00]: because I miss those old school cushy
skunk flavors, but I've already said too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, everything is quite potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wrap the message up with from your
friend J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: J.H., my dude, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I do owe you a free pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
if you do send a grow question to the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help tab on I read genetics or I read
direct dot com, they both have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send a question to there and I do
read that question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that you win a free pack of I
read genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that giveaway is sponsored
by seeds here now dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another message here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is kind of a follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm spoiling J.H., but these two
questions came back to back and this one
[SPEAKER_00]: was super easy to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I like the flavor of one of your 20
percent THC crosses more than one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 percent THC crosses, should I go with
the flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we often teach people here in
Colorado that the THC number isn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate deciding factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how good a product is THC percentage
in a plant is what a lab detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may find that they're like I
said a moment ago, there are better
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's better esters, palates,
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other things in this
plant that affect the way we consume it
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way we enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a 30 percent THC plant with
zero terps, I might not enjoy it as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as I would a 20 percent THC plant with
point four terps in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that little bit of terps is going to
make a big difference and make it taste
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you rather eat cardboard or would
you rather eat cardboard that tastes like
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries and candy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want some good flavor in the mouth
or do you just want blandness?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nose always knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a podcast called Follow Your
Nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those terps are super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer, if you like one
better, smoke the one you like better,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to wrap that up and
follow up by saying we are often fooled,
[SPEAKER_00]: bamboozled, if you will, by just THC
labeling on jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the dispensary,
when you go to buy seeds, everybody puts a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential THC number or a lab tested THC
number on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the dispensary,
the jar says whatever banana kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: however much an ounce, however much a
gram, whatever, they list the price on the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll have a big star on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty seven percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watch people scan the shelf and they
go, oh, a 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take an ounce of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that may not be the best
product for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them a smell because I believe that
the nose is what matters the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose is going to know if there's
something in there that I am lacking or
[SPEAKER_00]: would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose goes, no, that's not the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your nose lights up and your eyes go,
that's the jar you should buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the weed that you should smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab test is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you kind of a good idea of how
potent it could and potentially should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other compounds in there are
greatly going to affect your buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't said this on the podcast in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of new subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, I think that THC let's compare
our buzz to a firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love fireworks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of us love fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that the THC is how high up
into the air your firework will go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to smoke THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your firework is going to shoot up into
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my analogy is that the terpenes are
the colors of that firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that firework gets up into the air,
it's going to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to put off a purple ring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to put off red, yellow and
green sparkles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be the one that just goes
and all the weird shit rains from the sky
[SPEAKER_00]: after it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be super fucking loud and
fly up into the air and go boom and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just put off one big bright white ball of
light for a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be fucking orange?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a lot of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the terpenes decide when we
get our buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC makes us go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes decide, do we get the
munchies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get paranoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get the giggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get a little turned on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get fucking scared of life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get super introspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just get really weird, completely
weird altogether?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the terpenes mixing with the other
compounds, deciding what kind of buzz you
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that shopping just for THC and
focusing just on numbers like that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my my wrap up statement for all
of this talk about THC percentages and
[SPEAKER_00]: potency is I've had a lot of weed tested
in labs and I've had a lot of it come back
[SPEAKER_00]: really high in lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I've never had?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a machine come back to buy
another bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those numbers don't do me any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good numbers for the machine,
but they're not perfect numbers for
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans need other compounds to enjoy our
product properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy, JH, you only get one
free pack of seeds, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did double up and read two messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, thank you for all the correspondence,
the communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like your ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't respond to every email that you
send me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of them, but I do agree
with most of what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do appreciate your insight and your
your education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You teach me some things sometimes that I
had never thought about you think in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to my buddy, JH up there in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your address, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do owe you a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, you guys I try not to
send free seeds to Canada because it does
[SPEAKER_00]: cost me $40, $40 US dollars in shipping to
pack up some seeds and send them to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But JH has been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been participating for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sent me your messages, and I have
read it and you're in Canada, don't worry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will try to limit the amount of
Canadian messages I do read because 40
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks a pop does add up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to our friends at seeds here
now.com for sponsoring a free seed
[SPEAKER_00]: giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this did come from the grow
help tab on irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called striker can and it says what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of question do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a problem in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing strawberry starburst,
strawberry bubblegum and wedges.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're indoors under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in week five of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH was 5.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EC was 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daytime temp is 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime temperature is 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity is 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to the question part of this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Yo Rasta Jeff, I'm wondering what
the best thing to add to cocoa for a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetener taste, taste enhancer,
terpene adder could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ordered bud candy from advanced
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to bash products on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, here's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew with advanced nutrients
products, I felt like all of my flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: tasted the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have og cushion one part of the
room, strawberry haze in the other
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookies in the other part of the
room, feed them all advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all taste like advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all has that really, once you grow and
smoke it a little bit, you'll start to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be in smoke circles, you'll hit a
joint, you'll hit a bowl and you'll go on
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced nutrients grower, you'll start to
taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, in my opinion, I'd all taste
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, there's nothing wrong with that
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't all taste the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I breed weed to taste really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it all tastes like the same
bud candy to me, I don't enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I do already add tiger bloom
booster and ocean marine cuisine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ocean marine will definitely help you
out enhancing the terps and the health of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm drying for about 10 days,
the first four days at 50% RH,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the rest down to 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may stay at the 50 for a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all right, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I use a dehumidifier on low with
added ventilation in a five by seven
[SPEAKER_00]: closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making the best with what you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got the lemon Jeffrey as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really want to bring out that sweet
citrus smell and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for any advice rusted Jeff my
dude, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how to enhance flavor a
little bit in these sweeter strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In previous episodes, I did talk about
adding kelp product to make things taste
[SPEAKER_00]: that up to enhance that skunky,
earthy, funky, cushy aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the kelp really brings that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also bring out the aroma and
flavors in most of your other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to be I feel like it
kind of it helps more with the cushy
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, but it will help with your other
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about more specific products
that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use a lot of terpene enhancer
products, I kind of just try to grow an
[SPEAKER_00]: overall healthy plant with a good balanced
diet and a good environment, and then dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and cure it properly and select good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want products that you can add,
there is a product called turpinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not used turpinator myself,
but I have heard good reports and good
[SPEAKER_00]: results from the product turpinator and
it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shit better work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a product called sweet from
botanic care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer a couple of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are exactly what you're asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are sweetener products to add to
your nutrient mix and they claim that
[SPEAKER_00]: these products will sweeten up the flavor
of your end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used the sweetener product with
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the sweetener without flavors to
work on sugars and carbohydrates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and those plants did come out quite
tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I could recommend is
humble honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble honey is great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use humble honey way back in the
day before I made the switch to the new
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe after thinking about this myself,
I might start adding that back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humble honey had a lot of different
things in there and it definitely made a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the flavor and aroma of my
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I did mention kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about just basic things
instead of recommending products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, those companies do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying shit that I've used and
shit that I've read and seen work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not given any money by any of these
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugars and carbs are definitely going to
help increase the flavor of your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbonaria is a great product from new
millennium that I would definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend adding to your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overfeed the carbonaria,
especially if you're in a hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carbonaria will gum up the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a hydro system,
I may choose a different product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboload from Advanced Nutrients is
actually a pretty decent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to all of that stuff, if you're using
the turpinator, the sweet, the humble
[SPEAKER_00]: honey, don't use all those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbonaria and the carboload.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to that, I would add Budswell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a liquid back guano product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your plants go shebang in
multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get beefier and fatter and they
will taste and smell good because of that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to say something that may be
controversial because this is not how I
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, but sometimes organics will bring
out the most amazing flavors in your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the plant and the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a sour diesel that grows OK in
soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the flavor and aroma that
I can achieve when my friend grows it in
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend that grows the same cut
in a hydro bucket and a hydro system and
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit comes out so stinky that it
makes my eyes feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to put it in multiple baggies and
that's just the difference in how he is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some phenotypes will make a
difference if you grow in hydro soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix with bottled nutrients and maybe some
plants will benefit from growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta figure out what the plant likes
or you've got to find the phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: works best with your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I talk a lot about you
selecting the phenotype that works best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you instead of asking me my favorite
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite might not work well in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably gets too tall too fast for
your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing the right genetics in the right
environment with the right system will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely help you enhance the flavor and
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants just don't have a lot of
flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some plants have got the wrong
flavor and aroma for you, so it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about finding again the correct genetics
for to meet your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They meet your needs flavor and aroma wise
and also grow well in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to find that and then dial that
in and perfect that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also another thing that can definitely
affect the flavor and aroma of our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: is the dry and cure process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow these plants perfectly for 7-8
weeks in veg, 9 or 10 weeks in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then once we cut them down we can
really destroy these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of people mess up huge
beautiful harvests just by not drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I should mention is that
there is not really one magic bullet to
[SPEAKER_00]: making our cannabis perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get everything right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a giant chessboard and
everything on the chessboard has to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: place if you want to get that checkmate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't rely on just one bottle,
one product, one trick, one silver bullet
[SPEAKER_00]: to make our product top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start with the right light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the right light,
the right spectrum, the right intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right duration, then nothing will work
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need good air.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the VPD in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the temperature right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the humidity right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too hot in the room,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start volatizing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too dry, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes start volatizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too wet, terpenes won't
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to keep everything in line from
day one, not just in flower, from the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get it started in veg and take
top shelf care of this plant all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, 6-8 weeks of veg,
9, 10, maybe 11 weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take perfect care of that plant every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one day where the VPD got
off just a little bit, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will show in your end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been one, two, maybe 3%
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not 3% more THC, just overall a 3% better
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, another thing to think about is
the environment in which you are drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: curing, and storing this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are growing down in a
basement or in a shed or in a garage or in
[SPEAKER_00]: a backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that room stinks and smells funky when
you hang up your plants, once all the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and everything goes away from
your plants, it's going to start absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: that stinky, funky, musty, grandma's
basement sort of smell and that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're drying in the tool shed in the
garage and it smells like old lawn mowers
[SPEAKER_00]: or it smells like old moldy house,
that will end up in the flavor of your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about where you're drying and
curing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a week or two weeks before it's even
time to harvest, start planning your
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how much product you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how much space you're going to
need to cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry it, hang it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how you're going to move the
air in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the humidity and the temperature
proper in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan that now because a lot of people,
like I said a moment ago, have destroyed
[SPEAKER_00]: crops after the harvest phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen commercial grows take down giant
harvests and not know what to do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and end up throwing half of it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So half of their work got destroyed after
the harvest phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I got everything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry it, cure it, store it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's not one single silver
bullet that you can shoot that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this grow smell amazing, look
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Level 10 weed comes from growing that weed
perfectly every day consistently,
[SPEAKER_00]: several cycles, and then achieving that
masterpiece of a crop of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend Striker Can,
