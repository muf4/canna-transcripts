[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Cat Coop and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna do any ads this episode
because I have a lot of stuff written
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna drop that music out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been telling you guys that I'm gonna
do a lesson on grow room scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've started working on that and I
have got a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that part, I wanna talk
about a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and got my medical marijuana card
renewed a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking I should talk about that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna turn down the music real quiet
here and just start the show right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ads this time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick shout out to Hygro and their growing
supplies and super huge shout out to Rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Worm Company and Nature's Green
Remedies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my ads for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my medical marijuana card renewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the process has gotten super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much called, made an appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me in at my scheduled appointment
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first time that's ever happened
in a medical marijuana doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got my... It's not a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it bugs me for some reason
because nobody here has a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medical marijuana recommendation
from a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: He writes out a recommendation for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was debating if I wanted to talk about
this or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the table in the doctor's office,
there's just a little sign and it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased plant count will require
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a dollar sign and then an
amount of plants and then another dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: sign and an amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you provide records and you tell this
doctor that you are in need of a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: plant count, he will increase your plant
count for a small fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a Colorado resident and if
you're not familiar with all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: what that means is when you go to this
doctor, when you get your medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card, you are now allowed to
grow six plants in your private residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: These doctors are now able to write in
recommendations that you are able to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: more cannabis and possess more cannabis
than the original six.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, you've got to bring a little
bit of doctor note some sort of history,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of record saying that
something's wrong with you, and you also
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pay a fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a small fee, I walked out of there
with a handsome plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't talk about the numbers on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a huge plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want it to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went for what he would give me just to
see if he would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the highest he offered there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about the benefits of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I did it is because,
of course, I grow and I want to keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow protected with my medical marijuana
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a little bit more safety,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the recreational shops are really
high priced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to buy a gram of hash at a
recreational shop, it would cost you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably twice as much as it would at a
medical shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my medical marijuana privileges
intact a lot for that because sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: do run out of shatter and I go up to Green
and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs
[SPEAKER_00]: and I purchase grams of hash from our
friend's hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jordans and the Johns up at Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good reason to keep my medical
marijuana card intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the process and I talked
about the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered the medical
marijuana card experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super easy this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say the doctor's name or
anything on the podcast, but if you'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: his information, just email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com and
I'll get you that doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a doctor in Pueblo,
I've got a recommendation for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to my next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to get to the grow lesson,
but I've got a few things written down
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep seeing a lot of people talking
about the temperature of their e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The e-nail is the little box that plugs
into the wall that's got an LED or an LCD
[SPEAKER_00]: display on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually an LED, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little LED light display shows numbers
and then it's got an up and down switch on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make the temperature hotter and
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the one I have actually has a USB
port in it so that you can charge your
[SPEAKER_00]: iPhone or whatever kind of phone you got
on there, but then it's got a little cord
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes out and it attaches to the nail
and it heats up the nail for you all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the e-nail and then your dad nails
always hot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature on your nail does not
match what the numbers on that box say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to get to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say they've seen pictures
of my e-nail and right now it's flashing
[SPEAKER_00]: at 852.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's jumping between 850 and 852.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you tried to take it down
with that at 852 degrees, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be too hot, but that is not a
representation of degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is simply a setting on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that, and maybe there is one
brand, maybe one or two brands that does
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but I don't think that that coil is
sending the temperature to that nail and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way back to there and telling it
that it's 860 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is more of a setting like if you turn
your volume on your car stereo to 11,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not putting out 11 anythings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just on 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my car stereo, I can crank it
up to about 28 before the subwoofer starts
[SPEAKER_00]: sounding like complete crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that 26 is my ideal temp on my car
stereo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean I'm putting out 26
anything in particulars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the level where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think your e-nails are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have established that the 860 I'm
seeing on my screen right now on my LED is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a frequency that is being put
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's being measured by that
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep in mind that that number
has to travel all the way down the cord
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it has to get to the coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That coil is the heating part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That coil has to heat whatever type of
nail you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using this new highly educated,
it's the e-nail insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the name printed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew the name until I started talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the HED adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to heat up this barrel shaped
piece and then the head of the nail heats
[SPEAKER_00]: up after that because the heat's got to
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For it to know what the exact heat is on
the head of that nail would be ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask of that device.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is that number doesn't match the
head of the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a frequency or a dial setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you find the ideal number,
just remember that ideal number and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not actually getting at 856 degrees
or I've seen some of them set at perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 because people think that's the
perfect temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number is not correlating to the
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see my pictures and it's 850,
quit bitching at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's my point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another topic written down but the
iPhone has locked me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one, the pesticide issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, we talked about this a little bit in
a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about some of the dispensaries
that got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a quick article, scroll through my
phone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have been a little more prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are upset about this pesticide
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all over social media websites
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, pesticide violations were issued
to the following recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it lists Mindful, Green Solutions,
Evolutionary Holdings, Green Cross
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, MMJ America, Organic Greens,
Altitude East Treatments, RINO,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sweetleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: All violators were using Eagle 20 and
petroleum-based fungicide that is harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: to humans and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altitude East Treatments was also using
mallet and avid, both harmful to humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Cross Denver was also using mallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these violations are well-known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to talk about a lot more
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the original source of that
because I've seen it cut and pasted on so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different social media sites that I
don't know who to give credit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys were spraying Eagle 20 on
plants and then selling those buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weird part here is MMJ America just
won a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they enter their Eagle 20 laden buds
into the cannabis cup or are they growing
[SPEAKER_00]: separate crops and entering that and not
even giving the public a chance to go buy
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that that's what some of the
shops do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have been taken off the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will never make it to harvest
and those buds will never be sold to
[SPEAKER_00]: customers or patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there was medicine or
product that did make it out of the door
[SPEAKER_00]: and has been treated with Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20 or whatever else they were
listing here that we definitely should not
[SPEAKER_00]: be consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these were tomatoes and they discovered
that these people had been spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes with these products, the tomato
farmer or distributor or whoever's in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge at that point would have to go make
some sort of a press release and
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have to be held accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would have been a much larger deal if
this would have been another agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: product or a horticultural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's ridiculous is the cannabis industry
makes so much money that they should have
[SPEAKER_00]: been on top of this and been doing the
right thing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting legal cannabis here and then
we're trying to set the pace here and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to go and do shit like this,
which really puts a black eye on the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the people that were leading
the industry should have been more
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible with our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say to not shop at those stores or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you want to do, but I would
definitely pay more attention to where my
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is coming from and I would pay
more attention to what's going in my
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the more reason, you guys,
to grow your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got a couple of more
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I want to get on to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, let's just get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about grow room scheduling,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 10 minutes into the show already and
I have got a lot of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably going to end up taking us
a couple of episodes here, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get through the veg process
today and then the next lesson will be
[SPEAKER_00]: planning your flowering cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a whole bunch of stuff and
honestly, it took me a little bit to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this together because, and I'm going to
apologize right now, I know that the last
[SPEAKER_00]: few episodes have been a little wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seriously had a major concussion and I
can't focus to write long things like I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to, long lessons and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming back to me slowly,
but it takes me a little more effort and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more time to focus and write down
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bear with me, but the lessons are
coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that things have not been the way
they should be with the show, but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: not been the way I should be, so I
couldn't bring you the show you needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my shit back together,
which means the show is getting its shit
[SPEAKER_00]: back together too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for being kind of slacking
off, but I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a head injury, you don't know
what the hell is going on and it's crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting back to it and the show is
getting back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me prove that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what I have written and I have got
a lot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to try to read it off
the computer because the phone screen is
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pull up the same thing here on the
phone, same thing on the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it match?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this one's not updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're just going to read it off
the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: An average grow should take about 100 to
120 days, maybe 150 days total in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvesting, drying, trimming and
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to provide our plants with
optimal conditions, appropriate feedings,
[SPEAKER_00]: careful training and selective pruning in
order to produce the finest medicine we
[SPEAKER_00]: can offer to our patients or clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that every day in each cycle is an
opportunity to show the plant some love
[SPEAKER_00]: and help your crop reach its full
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like each feeding, each application
of teas, bug sprays, foliar feeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: any interaction with your plants is your
chance to make sure your crop reaches your
[SPEAKER_00]: client's expectations and the plant's full
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great way to improve your crops is to
start a solid grow schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I want to talk about two different
schedules a grower should be on top of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first schedule will be the basic
planning of a crop from seed to clone all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to discuss the phases of growth
from a small clone or seedling into
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth into the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to break down the flowering phase
into trimesters and talk about what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are doing and what they want
through the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also talk about what you could be
doing at each phase to improve your
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote here that if I can get you through
120 day grow lesson in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start my discussion on planning a
schedule that keeps your grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: producing as much herb as possible with as
little downtime as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, of course, will take multiple lights
and at least two small grow spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: but setting up a small perpetual grow to
keep yourself supplied with headstache is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably easier than you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize now that I've written way too
much for one episode, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely going to be broken down,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where we get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you begin your grow, I suggest
getting yourself a planner and making a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be flexible because these are
plants, but try to stick with your plan if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also suggest taking a lot of notes,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wonder what you did to that plant to
make it so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what you did so that you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I'll describe the phases of
growth and timeframes of our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that this grow is going to take
about 100 to 120 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go larger plants,
you can go up to 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people take a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the veg period is what's going to
make your difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start off with seedlings or clones,
and that's going to take about 14 days to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the seedling phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about 14 days when you start
germinating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the day you germinate it to the day
it's like a little plant, it's about 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call that 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone takes about 14 days to root and
get ready to be a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say seedling and clone
phase is about 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg growth depends on your goal,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to veg, if you're going in
small pots, you can veg for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go into larger pots,
you can veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people veg for 30, 45 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen guys veg for 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the outdoor plants that people veg
for the early start of the year before the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor season, I've seen people veg
plants for four or five or six months to
[SPEAKER_00]: put them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going to happen is your plants
are going to get bigger and bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger the longer you veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to go for a short veg
in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your flowering phase, I'm going to go
for a nine week flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the plants I work with are about
nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine weeks is a good number because that
gives us three trimesters of three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: each to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about my theory of the
trimesters on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that'll help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got 14 days in seedling,
63 days in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at 77 days there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us about 30 days to veg and fix
any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just basically start a short grow
from seed or clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow I'm going to talk about now is
basically the type of grow I would do if I
[SPEAKER_00]: were searching through a 10 pack of seeds
to find the keepers in the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, I would usually use like a
three gallon pot or a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would use, I don't know,
probably like between nine and 16,
[SPEAKER_00]: just depends on how small I'm going to
keep the plants and how tight I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: cramp them in the space under the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just one light is all I'm
talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we start from seeds or clones,
the only difference will be the first two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the clones root and the seedlings
take off, everything I'm talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work the same for seeds and
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with seeds, you'll have
to be sure that you eliminate the males
[SPEAKER_00]: before we get too far into flower,
but that's going to be your major
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say this is like if we're starting
day one, we'll say start day one right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we would cut our clones and start
germinating our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do any lessons on
germinating seeds or cutting clones
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm pretty sure I've covered that
in past episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to refresh your course,
go back and listen to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you guys want a brand new episode on
that, email me and I will go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to the old episode and I'll try to
do an update for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only if enough people ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode's out there, so it should
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut our clones and we started our
seeds for day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you want to mark the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out your grow calendar and mark it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: For clones and seeds, I recommend a
24-hour light cycle, you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: to start the first couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first few days are just a waiting
game, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're waiting for seeds, they'll pop
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pop up from whatever medium you've
put them in, in like 48 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully, or maybe it'll take them a
couple days to start growing to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest putting your seedlings into,
I use beer cups, like solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those, put your seedlings into the
cups with a light potting mix with plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of drainage and holes in the bottoms of
the cups, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once your seedlings have developed a nice
tap root of like about an inch to three
[SPEAKER_00]: inches long, that's when you want to throw
those in your dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clones will be lazy, but they'll root
around 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys are going to take a
little longer to get your clones to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about a healthy mother plant,
a good rooting environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it takes you more time to get your
clones rooted, just plan that into your
[SPEAKER_00]: next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself an extra week or an extra
five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll start learning how to keep
healthier mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start learning how to clone better
and you'll speed up your cloning time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of extra clones at first
because they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not good at cloning,
if you're new at this, take extras because
[SPEAKER_00]: you will lose some and don't be sad about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after several days, let's see,
where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings are going to start growing
tall and skinny in the first few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several days, they'll develop their
first true leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time, the clones are rooted and
ready for cups and the seedlings will be
[SPEAKER_00]: small plants and catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: to the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't feed the seedlings until
about seven to 10 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do feed them, focus on root
inoculant and building a good root base
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a worm casting tea or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something like great white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use OGT, something that focuses on
root inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you guys hopefully you've caught on
to what I'm talking about by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a lot about root inoculant
with Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would feed the clones the same thing
when you put those into cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely like to feed my clones and my
seedlings a lot of root inoculants to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil funky and get the roots fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better roots, the better the fruits is
what I say all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by now, I feel like we should be
putting our clones into cups and starting
[SPEAKER_00]: week three if everything went correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fed the plants once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes me feel like everything is one
lesson now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've gotten to week three and
the clones and the seedlings are caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up, I feel like there won't be much
difference between the clone and the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings may grow more quickly
because they have what we call seed vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not always the case if you have
good clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some clones outgrow seedlings
before and it's been kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we've done up to this point is
pretty much plant our seeds in clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten our starter plants into cups
and we've fed them some worm tea or some
[SPEAKER_00]: root inoculant, maybe some great white,
maybe some OGT, something like that to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to call this the
beginning of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may call it pre-veg because we
haven't gone into our big pots yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to call it veg starting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've gotten out of the cloner,
now that we're not little baby seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, I'm going to say we're into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the veg state can last as long as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer you veg, like I said earlier,
the larger your plants are going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg phase is where we do 90% of the
topping, training, and pruning of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of did a lesson on topping and
stuff like that, but I plan to do another
[SPEAKER_00]: episode all about improving your crops and
improving your yields and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your plants are going to take up 90%
of the nitrogen that they use through
[SPEAKER_00]: their entire lives during the vegetative
phase of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: People tend to really overlook the veg
phase and they focus only on the bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: phase because that's when you can see your
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the veg phase is just as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is your veg space, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't spend the time
building a proper veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you teach those kids how to run before
you put them on the track, they'd be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we use each day as a chance
to prepare the plants for bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: our crop will look much better at harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My veg phase for my example of this grow
is going to be short, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, give me one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause and take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably take a dab while I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we are at the beginning of veg
is where I left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to feed my plants the first day
of each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mondays are usually my feeding day for my
personal crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, starting everything on a Monday
helps me keep track of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the first day of veg, I would feed
my plants a nice base nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: a light humic acid, some potassium
silicates to build strong cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also keep focusing on root
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't need any Kalamag or anything
like that for the first couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first couple of weeks,
your plant should be cool in the cups,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to have to plant them into
larger pots pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to see them get root bound
in those cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll also get tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to bush out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put them into a larger pot,
they'll start bushing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also a good time to adjust your
lights from 24 hours to an 18-6 schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them on for 18 hours,
off for six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants like a rest period, and it's also
going to save you money on your energy
[SPEAKER_00]: bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got your plants into cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to kind of grow a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got nice roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about three weeks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by the fourth week is when we
should start putting everything into
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we leave them in the cups too long,
they're going to get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start getting stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also when you put them into bigger
pots, they can go a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_00]: without needing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll help you out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to veg for a couple
extra weeks and you have time and space,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my example, we're just going to do a
quick crop and we're going to use three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots and they'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carefully put everything from your cups
into a three gallon pot or a larger pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I've talked about
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've talked a little bit about
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys need help transplanting,
let me know and I'll talk more about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm pretty sure I've covered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carefully put everything into a larger
pot and feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be about week four, maybe into
week five by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I hope you started doing these
into pots around week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't wait too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed them and you're going to feed them
a strong dose of root inoculant,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always going to do that through veg
right up to kind of the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them a veg based nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use, if I'm using bottled nutrients for
this, I would recommend Botanicare Pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Blend Pro Soil Formula, the grow formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that,
it's just what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use some humic acid in there for
this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my recommendation, if you're using
bottles, I would say Liquid Karma from
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use a fulvic acid, which
Organicare sells a liquid fulvic acid that
[SPEAKER_00]: works great for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use some Cal Mag at this point,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start needing some Cal Mag
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very light dose of Cal Mag to start
because your babies aren't ready for it
[SPEAKER_00]: just yet possibly, and I don't want you to
burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with that Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's about to be time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend something to feed
the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic molasses or something like Humboldt
Honey or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybre would be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything like that with a lot of
molasses-y type stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now our plants are in their final pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants can be topped or super
cropped or manipulated into a screen of
[SPEAKER_00]: green or whatever you have planned for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure if you're going to do any
topping or pruning, do that about 10 to 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days before you start flowering the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants need a little bit of time to
recover after you've topped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are apical dominant, which means
they want to top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you've cut the tops, the hormones
have to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to move hormones around,
and you want those hormones built up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tips of your plants before you flower
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really helpful for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start topping stuff and pruning
things and then flower right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just going to make little tiny buds
and confuse the shit out of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we are in our bigger pots and
we've fed everything, I'm going to say we
[SPEAKER_00]: are in full veg mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our plants in the finishing pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have been topped and super cropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our lights on a veg schedule of
18 on and 6 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be feeding a solid veg recipe at
the start of every week and watching for
[SPEAKER_00]: any signs of bug problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a good idea to start a bug
prevention regimen by now if you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: already started spraying or doing
something to keep the mites away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil is a great way to prevent bugs
while you're in veg, but do not ever spray
[SPEAKER_00]: a flowering plant with neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One application of neem oil on a flowering
plant will ruin the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor will be miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make extracts, they will taste like
neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't spray anything on your
flowering plants, any bug sprays or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything on your flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to spray stuff on
flowering plants, make sure it's a well,
[SPEAKER_00]: well thought out foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think I can write a whole
separate rant on pest management in
[SPEAKER_00]: another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said that we should feed on Monday of
every week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to feed on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix up a nice reservoir of nutrients and
feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Monday, they get a nice healthy
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually by Wednesday or Thursday,
they need more, they need a water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just feed them clean pH balanced
water with no nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just feed them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on Monday again, I will give them
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next time that they're
thirsty, probably that next Wednesday or
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday, they will get a fully organic
worm tea that I have brewed for like 36
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put worm castings in there and put
Grokashi in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a little bit of Dragonfly Earth
medicine, the lush roots in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: put a little bit of fish hydroslate,
I put some sea crop, and then I'll feed my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get fed teas probably twice in
veg and probably three times during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it makes a huge difference
because I make a pretty awesome tea that
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean taught me how to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my feeding idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever broken down my
week to week feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna be responsible for your
weekly feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wanna let you experiment and
find what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got questions about specific
nutrients, let me know and I'll do my best
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out how to incorporate that into
your grow for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna take a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was saying earlier, we can veg
as long as we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my example, we're gonna veg for about
30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can top and manipulate the plants as
much as you want while in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I already read this?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I would stop topping about two
weeks before flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: My short crops don't really get much
topping and pruning, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running a seed crop and I wanna see
what the seedlings are, I really don't top
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take two clones from each plant just
before I flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean up the bottoms just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I flower, I clean up the
bottoms once I flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my small crops really don't get much
topping or pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get the test crops just in and
out quickly so I can see what I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I've got a bunch of boys in
there, or if I don't see the traits I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for, then I just wanna get that
out of there and scrap it as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for specific traits at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next 30 days while we're in veg,
basically we need to watch for bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: watch for problems, and keep the plants as
healthy and happy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest checking each plant every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
but however many plants you've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should touch every plant every single
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know you're growing from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know you've got solid
medicine that doesn't need to be sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: with Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know that if you do see a
problem, you'll be on top of it and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to solve the problem before
it gets out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important being a good
gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest checking each day and make
notes of what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see anything that stands out to
you, make a note of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's good, if it's bad, if it's weird,
if you're not sure, if it's new,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's questionable, make a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget, because I know you're
gonna say, oh, membership, the notes are
[SPEAKER_00]: in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, we're pot heads, we're pot growers,
we're dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna forget something,
write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when maybe one day you're gonna wanna
run a business and the guy with the notes
[SPEAKER_00]: will get the opportunity to run a business
over the guy with the head full of
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit and ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've written something down that shows
you've done something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other guy's like, I remember doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that are hiring you to be their
master grower at their dispensary don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want your hopes and dreams in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanna see it on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take notes, you got something
that's documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that it's legal, you don't have to
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you old school growers didn't
want any notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, but now you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set a date for your flowering cycle is
what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide how long you wanna veg,
set a date for your flowering cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then commit to that and veg for that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your plants trimmed up, get them
pruned, get them topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna put them in a screen of
green, like Spence taught us about,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in the screen of green and get
them nice and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get them ready for the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone for 30 minutes and I don't think
I can get enough of the flowering cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it worth your listen in to this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're just gonna start wrapping
up the show at 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys really listen a lot when I put
out shorter episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't seem to get the attention
deficit disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just gonna do a short episode
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come back in a week and I will have
a solid lesson about the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to get Spence on an upcoming
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Sean and he'll be back in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode coming up about how to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of things planned,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really getting back on my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting more lessons written down,
getting more episodes planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you sticking through my rough
patch there while I had to do some sloppy
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody who sent me well
wishes on taking care of my head,
[SPEAKER_00]: wishing me better on my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to say I'm about, I kept saying I
was 90%, you know, I'm about 85% back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep noticing sometimes I'll say the
wrong word in a sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I told somebody that I was
going to eat this banana and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually holding a burrito.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't even realize that I kept
saying banana, but it was a burrito.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they corrected me and I said,
yeah, this banana is tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, it's a fucking burrito,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realized I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was describing something that was purple
and I called it orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I did that, but I don't,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's stuff like that that's going on
in my head that's still a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I forget my password still
and I try to log into my computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm getting it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate you guys sticking with
me through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a really scary time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I'm coming back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap up the show, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that part that I read?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it says, thanks for listening to
another episode.
