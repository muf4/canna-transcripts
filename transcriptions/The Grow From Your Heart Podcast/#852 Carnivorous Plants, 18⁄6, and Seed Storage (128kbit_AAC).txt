[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 852 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the only podcast that gives you
free seeds on every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to know how to win
those free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is go to that website
and find the tab that says Grow Help or
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a good grow question,
and I read that question here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, I'll send you a coupon code for a
free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question on today's podcast came
from that Grow Help tab, and it came from
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy Mike Miller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Miller, make sure you check your
inbox and your spam because you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds from
ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm switching my
lights to your recommended 18 six light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle for the last two weeks of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I still use a couple of hours of UV a
day or does the new light cycle replace
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of great things to talk
about in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people may be new to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me address this 18 six light cycle
at the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is exactly what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that when you are running a
cultivar, which you are familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do this on the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this with something that you've ran a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how long it takes to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly when to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn when that plant is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that finishes at 60
days, start this at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that finishes at 70
days, start this at day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I highly recommend learning the
cultivar before you implement this
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is exactly what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 10 days of the flowering
phase, I turned my lights back on to an 18
[SPEAKER_00]: hours on and six hours off light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people think that that is wild and or
outrageous, but most people have tried it,
[SPEAKER_00]: have reported positive results and great
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people that have given me
negative feedback are the people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: not tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend 18 hours on and six hours
off for the last 10 days of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I recommend this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my opinion, in my experience,
in my learning, in my studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen that this does make our plants
finish a few days more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also will make them denser and beefier
and it will also give you more harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just use the word denser?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think that's a real word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna edit, gonna keep moving because
it works, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my theory is that you get more
product sooner and it is more dense and
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky and you get more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't want more bud, more flower,
more product?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna definitely help out the
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last 10 days of flower,
I recommend 18 hours on and six hours off
[SPEAKER_00]: until harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are gonna say, what about revege?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna give it that much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna cut it down way before that
does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question here is should this
listener, should this grower, be
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementing and implementing their UV
light in this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be completely honest with you,
I do not use, I do not add, I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement any UV light in my grow at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've studied, something
I've thought about doing in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is not anything that I do at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any solid input,
any solid feedback for that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when people do ask me about this
18-6 light cycle and making adjustments,
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally say all I change is the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing I make different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't change the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't change the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just change the duration as the only
thing I change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using a far red spectrum at the
end of the flowering cycle, I may still
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to do that at the end of the
flowering cycle just to let them know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, it is sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That far red does increase the sleeping
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them go to sleep much more
quickly is what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the only thing I can recommend
that you do use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else I would do just the same
as you have been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're putting some LED or some UV in
there, then do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything the same except the duration
of the overall lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using that far red, definitely
use that at the end of the flowering cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: or at the end of the light cycle at the
end of the day to make them go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the only thing I can
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I've got true experience
with the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that far red, you want to keep that
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else, you're ahead of me because
now you're doing experiments that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: not had a chance to do yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may learn some stuff I don't even
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm home here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear how this works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear what method you do go
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also make sure you check your inbox

[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I appreciate
all of the good vibes and the education
[SPEAKER_00]: you share with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the positive feedback like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it's definitely a great
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a two part question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I've got a two part answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only going to win one pack of
seeds, but enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you store your seed stock to keep
them viable, both long term and just for a
[SPEAKER_00]: year ish?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just a year ish most of my so
anything that I bred for sales for retail
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't stick around for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds don't stick around for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very rare that I have the same batch
of seeds for more than a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially feminized seeds, they sell very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make kind of I make small batches and
just continuously produce things instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of making a whole bunch of stuff and
having it back stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the stuff is fresh,
not even a year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some outdoor stuff that does kind
of get sat around and gets put down at
[SPEAKER_00]: blowout prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are in a safe that is in a basement
in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where those seeds will be stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are long term seeds don't stick
around very long, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything for retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is for my personal stuff,
it is if it's my personal stash,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I'm just preserving that I'm
kind of hoarding that I'm collecting just
[SPEAKER_00]: to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'll ever grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might one day, but I don't know because
I want to grow it, but also like having
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a weird that's a breeder hoarder
sort of a thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things go in a safe that is in a
very cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The safe that area always stays an ambient
cool temperature somewhere between 67 and
70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: 72 degrees ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always real nice in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a safe in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tucked safely in an airtight
container in that safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my personal hoard.
[SPEAKER_00]: My collection, my stash, my show it off on
Instagram and show all my friends on
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got some stuff that I'm going to
grow fairly soon or at least within the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is in the crisper drawer of my
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in an airtight container in the
crisper drawer of my refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds won't get played with the
manipulated, moved in and out of that cold
[SPEAKER_00]: very often, because my concern is
condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about as soon as you pull a soda or
a package of something out of the fridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: that condensation starts happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any of that moisture getting
to my seed stock and damaging my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is what makes seeds germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could cause them to germinate
right inside the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to open the fridge one day
and have sprouts coming out of my fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: seed storage container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would break my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just going to leave them in
there for storage until growth or storage
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time, I do recommend the the
what is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The crisper drawer in the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just going to show your friends
them frequently and look at them and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through them like they're baseball cards,
which isn't a bad thing, enjoy your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spent money on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You worked hard for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time to gather and
collect these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvel them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do that, just keep them
in a cool, dry, dark place at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend somewhere secure and safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people know what they are, these seeds
are valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because to your wife and your
girlfriend, they're just more stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the right person, those are
freaking gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how things work like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the right person, those are
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some people, they're nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep them in a cool, safe,
dark, dry, locked location.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this question that I want
to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, dry, dark place is the most
important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use silicate packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the silicate packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to keep moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a desiccant pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to store your seeds in
somewhere where there may be moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: a desiccant pack is what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what removes moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a Boveda.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boveda is Boveda.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to say it today,
they keep the moisture in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to remove moisture, so use that
silicate pack if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy the purple kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised there's not some within
reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start off purple and they turn baby
blue and they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they start off blue, turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I pull them out of the
package, they're fresh and I can tell when
[SPEAKER_00]: they change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep those with a lot of my big batches
of seeds just to keep that moisture at bay
[SPEAKER_00]: because like I said, moisture is the
number one enemy for our seeds until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now retail seeds don't stick around that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the retail seeds stay in a very
cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate controlled, humidity controlled
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very safe, very secure area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of locks, security cameras,
guards, dogs, all that sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be exaggerating for the sake of TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to catch myself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what we're going to do with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you store your seed stock to keep
them viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: The crisper drawer or in a shoe box in the
safe in the basement, to be honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term, my retail seeds don't stick
around long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get close to being a year old,
put them on clearance, get them out super
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of that, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of cleaning machine do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the process of making one and I
want to know if I'm going overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good seed sorter is hard to find
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen two very viable options.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is it's about two and a half
or three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty tall cumbersome machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about three feet tall, two feet wide,
and it's got a vacuum attachment to it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you hook your shop vac up to one
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dump your material in one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls down like a series of trap doors
and stairways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vacuum sucks the usable
material one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls through one door or your seeds
fall through one door and the chaff is
[SPEAKER_00]: what the other part is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls through another door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of times I see that covered
with a sheet of plexiglass so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually watch your material run through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll set up a shop vac on one side,
two five-gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour your material in the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn on the vacuum first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour in the material and it sucks the
lightweight shit goes flying this way
[SPEAKER_00]: because the vacuum and then all your seeds
fall to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty well separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to run it twice
depending on how quick and sloppy you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is very, very viable,
very usable, but it requires a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That which is another thing you have to
have and or buy and it's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes up quite a bit of space unless
you're running big batches of seeds like
[SPEAKER_00]: an outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, there's another device that
is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the size of a shoe box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is called the grow easy or the
easy seed seed sorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the exact name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a blue and or blue and green logo
on the front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either easy seed or grow easy seed
sorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's shaped like a shoe box and
it's got a little trap door on the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which you pour your material in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a computer fan inside of there
and there's a series of angled ledges,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to I'm not an engineer,
but it's got a bunch of angles in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and the computer fan blows the lightweight
material, which would be your dried up
[SPEAKER_00]: weed material right off the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the angles allow the seeds to roll
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the weed is lighter,
it blows off into the second drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the seeds are heavier,
all of those angles angle your seeds into
[SPEAKER_00]: another drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you get two little drawers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is filled with seeds and one is filled
with your chaff.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I'll take the seeds,
pour them into a bin and then I'll run
[SPEAKER_00]: that chaff one more time because a lot of
times I'll get a few more seeds enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it worth running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the easy seed or the grow easy seed
sorter is my second option.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lasted me quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that thing doesn't burn out because
it has been well worth the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be hard to replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would I would take I would take people
a full day to do the work that that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: does in just a few seconds, a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grow easy seed sorter is what I
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, good vibe Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've answered your question
and then some keep those seeds in a cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that crisper drawer for my personal
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else goes in a safe in a
basement in a lock secure area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the grow easy seed sorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like that big square thing that
you've seen advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've googled seed separators,
you've seen this device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I've seen people do is
just get like a cardboard box,
[SPEAKER_00]: a shallow cardboard box, something they
sell like cases of sodas or teas or
[SPEAKER_00]: kombucha is in just the flat is what I
think you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour all your stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen people lightly use a shop
vac and just keep feathering it,
[SPEAKER_00]: brother, and just lightly run that shop
vac over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate your seed from your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, get it real, real dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about in the last episode,
the unit of measurement for amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture you want in your seeds when
you're trying to separate the seed from
[SPEAKER_00]: the chaff is dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that is the exact unit of
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grind it up super dry and tip that tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the seeds are going to run to the
bottom and then just use a credit card
[SPEAKER_00]: like your uncle used to do when he was
cleaning weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your ID, a credit card,
your library card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys even know what that is anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoop up the weed up the tray and it'll
drop the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds will roll down because they're
round and heavier than the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the chaff up top, all the seeds on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're careful and gingerly about
it, you can use a shop vac or a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: just to go across the top and suck up all
the chaff and the seeds will be down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another guy telling me that they
simply put panty hose over the end of that
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum hose and then they can suck it all
up and the seeds will stay right there if
[SPEAKER_00]: they do fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of methods to doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of chaff, you can just
pour it into a bowl and scoop it right off
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll give you a big head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can shimmy that chaff around
a little bit in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds will fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of ways to skin this cap,
but it's not as daunting once you figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out some methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the old school way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started doing this, I took somebody
called it a colander.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else called it a strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it called several different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is is a powdered sugar sifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a handle with a ring on it with a
little tiny mesh, a net on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're supposed to run your powdered
sugar through there and you shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the powdered sugar real fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taking handfuls, not like full
handfuls, but small handfuls of material,
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping it in there and just rubbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rubbing it around in a circle and all
the material falls out into the bowl and
[SPEAKER_00]: all your seeds are left up here in the
wire mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rub too hard because you don't want
to course up the seeds on that mesh,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just give it a good rub, jostle them
around and all that material will fall out
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like a 9.99 method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy that bad bitch at Walmart
and you can get your seeds out of a small
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of material without giving yourself
a headache that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, I've given you three
or four great methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have good success in your seed
sorting machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is shameless, but if you make
one of these great seed sorting machines
[SPEAKER_00]: and you need somebody to run a prototype,
I know a guy that makes a lot of seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: also could give you a huge shout out on a

[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's keep this show on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more good question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, of course, also did come from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow help tab on I read genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who is called
the Red Eye Jedi, which is awesome because
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time ago I wanted to be in a reggae
band called Red Eye Jedi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were called Dread Eye Vibration
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were called Red Eye Jedi for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, oh, also read, I check your
inbox because you have a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds that I read direct dot
com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's good, Ross?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: High as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording a podcast, hanging out with
the homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, you're going to say,
what did you smoke today because you were
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking I feel like I'm zinging from
the dabs I took.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry Lime Soda Live Batter from Green
Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, just because it's been that
kind of a day, I took a few puffs off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little teeny tiny nubbin of a
joint, but it said that bitch had a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram of concentrates in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked down until I'm sure I got to
those concentrates because I was coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face turned colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face was as purple as my shirt here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shirt's not purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logo is purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can even see it anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywho, I got pretty purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking the Cherry Lime Soda
from Green Dot Labs, also a pre-roll from
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot with concentrates inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump in here to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay focused a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm a bit late to the party,
but I just found your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, never too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go catch up on the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I love the knowledge and the
experience you dropped to the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what drew me in was your positivity,
your love for the plant, and your
[SPEAKER_00]: humbleness to your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, thank you for noticing all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be a positive person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manifest destiny, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my life sucks, it's mostly because I
allowed something in my life to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my life is awesome, it's because I put
in the work to make my life fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's positivity, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do positive things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a positive outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about ingredients and following
the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Love for the plant, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot tell, I love these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't stop, won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that just comes with experience,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, humbleness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it for a while,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humbleness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the plants will humble you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's every time you start getting cocky
and thinking, I'm a badass grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bad bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will give you spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how the plants will fucking
humble you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, trust me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have humbled me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry has humbled me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's stay focused, because that is
hard today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is, and this is the
part that everyone's been waiting for,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your thoughts on using
carnivorous plants for natural pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control for indoor and outdoor grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I instantly thought of, oh, feed me,
Seymour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm currently venturing into
carnivorous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have stumbled upon a few houseplants
that would naturally help with plant pests
[SPEAKER_00]: and a tent setup and dozens that would
help for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never heard or seen anyone grow
these in the community and use them for
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, this is a really cool and creative
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a good addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not anything that I would 100%
rely on for one major reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not bashing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But carnivorous plants are stationary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spider mites and fungus gnats and
thrips are very mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, a portion of them are going to
go toward your carnivorous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need all of them to sacrifice
themselves to the volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, I'm going to have to
either release my own predator insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also are going to get demolished by
your carnivorous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm kind of paying for something
to get eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of sacrificing a few of my own
soldiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to jump in the volcano as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I need to spray something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then am I damaging my carnivorous
plants by spraying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're not going to get any food
because now there's no bugs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're stationary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only thing I don't like
about is that they're stationary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having security guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having fucking crocodiles in the
moat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in the moat for those
crocodiles to eat you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need soldiers at the gate to make sure
that nobody even gets to the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that's a weird ass analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm telling you, bro, Green Dot Labs
got to my head today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for jumping inside my brain with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the idea, but they're
stationary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want something out there getting shit
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had carnivorous plants that could
walk around and eat shit, I would be all
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had carnivorous plants that could
detect, hey, the spider mites went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would go up there and eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once the mites get to the top,
they're going to make their webs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to make their little their
little teepees up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get down to your
carnivorous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need something else to
battle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, it sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it battles all the caterpillars and the
moths that we get here, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't know if these carnivorous
plants will survive in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment as my ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line, I do like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool fucking idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd put them in the corners of the room,
every corner, maybe one in the middle or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're stationary and I need
something more mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I spray because I can cover the
entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I release predator bugs because
they'll go seek out, when they're hungry,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to go hunt out some spider
mites, some thrips, some fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go find it and eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I don't 100% agree with your
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how effective it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still do get a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check your inbox for
those free seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chukers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts,
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you once again for
listening to another episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun recording this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really got on a good ramble for this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good vibe, a good energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I contribute that to you for all these
great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to let you know that I will not
be here for the next week's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a week off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to a comedy festival in Las
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were at the festival, you know what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're there, give me a high five,
give me a fist bump, give me one or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop by, say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see me out in public anywhere,
it could be the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the sneaker shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be at a festival, a comedy
festival, a music festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get an email from you or a
social media message from you on Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, hey, bro, I saw you at this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool seeing you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come by, say hi, shake my hand,
give me a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big dude, but I'm a large
looking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks that go down to my
calves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of people around me talking
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a nice dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may look intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a stern look on my face because I
guess I've got resting bro face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to call it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just chilling, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably just high and confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out, be my friend, introduce
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just awkward and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do want to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to start the conversation
because I don't know that you know who I
[SPEAKER_00]: am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see me at a festival,
this goes for the year round, not just for
[SPEAKER_00]: the comedy festival this weekend that I'm
missing, but this goes for year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see me somewhere and you hear this
voice and you know that that's Rasta Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come give me a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that sort of interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will not be here for the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be back the week after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm going to a comedy
festival in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every time I go to this festival,
I come back with some sort of either
[SPEAKER_00]: chest, nose or throat sort of fucking junk
happening and I can't talk properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I miss two weeks, I just have had
way too much fun and you got to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: for another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I've really got for you
this episode.
