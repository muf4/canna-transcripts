[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was recently on, I've talked about
this on a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently on the iry army podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to all of
my friends who support the ivory army
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Billy for the co-hosting skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big up to gray beard for the
co-hosting and tech skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a very good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well done show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interactive show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did 30 minutes of a kind of structured
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked me pre-written questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, they opened it up to the,
uh, the chat audience and they got to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a well done show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to, uh, showcase my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to talk a lot about my history and
who I am and got to answer all the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, uh, some of my friends, uh,
friends and supporters have wanted to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out the iry army
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already subscribed,
go to YouTube, give them a subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're not subscribed to my show,
please do click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to my friends at
the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, not just thanks for the podcast,
but thanks for the hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after we wrapped up the show,
we hung out on the, on the server and we
[SPEAKER_00]: chatted for a solid hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those guys were my friends,
my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big salute Rasta army, iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being, uh, I was going to
say part of the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be the team captain, but without all
you, uh, you maniacs, all you iry army
[SPEAKER_00]: members out there, I'm just a one man
army.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do need the support, the crew,
the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every one of you do mean a lot to
me, the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take more dabs before nine AM than most
people do all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I do have a lot of stuff I want to
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get the notes lined up so I
could read them and not get distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do an update on a recent silver
thiosulfate episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been following along
recently, I did a show about making our
[SPEAKER_00]: own silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a solution, which we would use to
reverse a plant to make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do a full recap because
I've already done the full episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll back a couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the followup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, um, I missed a few things,
which that's not uncommon for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to talk and be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's the word succinct might be the
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texting me, email me, let me know if
that's even a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I tried to get it right the first
time, but I'm human and I'm also a stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a robot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say I'm an alien, a hundred
percent human.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make some mistakes and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to do
[SPEAKER_00]: updates and corrections and also forgive
me when I do make more mistakes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, because I promise I'm going to
fuck up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now I do have some updates,
some corrections, uh, some more info for
[SPEAKER_00]: the silver thiosulfate episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here goes the updates over thiosulfate
part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these questions came from emails,
uh, from the YouTube channel, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the, I read genetics grow help tab
on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tab there that says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions about anything,
you can reach me through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just skip the grow help part, type in your
question at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have not answered your email or your
tester application, once again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me going to stay on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the questions were about
storing the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would mix up part A, mix up part B,
then mix them into a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we would dilute that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were many questions about storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the straightforward answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is best to, okay, it will last longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is the way that I should say this
for best preservation of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will last longest in the powder form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we mix it into the waters,
we are the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we are now reducing the shelf life of
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we combine those two sources,
together, we are now even greatly more
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the shelf life of that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we dilute it, we have even more
drastically reduced the shelf life of that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we dilute it, every time we
mix it, we're kind of reducing the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: life and the viability of that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I recommend is I mix up one liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that one liter is going to get me
through my, uh, multiple days of spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: my multiple applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can spray several plants, several times,
several days by mixing up one liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one liter recipe is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the recipe is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of water you need, the
measuring equipment, 500 mils,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the half gram, two and a half grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The math works out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about how much I need to get my
reversals done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make that one liter, uh, that one
liter stores long enough to get me through
[SPEAKER_00]: the 21 days worth of application without
having any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see a discoloration or
coloration, I guess any sort of color
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in there, sometimes you'll see
dark granules or black chunks at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the, the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a, I don't have a solid
shelf life for this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do know is that when I make that
liter and I throw that liter in the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator, that's something we're going
to talk about here is storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I keep it in a refrigerator and it is
clearly labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big jar and it says silver
thiosulfate solution on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where nobody in my house, it's just me
here, but I make sure that nobody that
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up, comes over, uh, is going to
drink out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Mike comes over, takes a giant dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Clint pops by, uh, he doesn't dab
cause he's kind of not that cool yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe he hits the dab pen and he gets
a little fuzzy and he goes to the fridge
[SPEAKER_00]: and needs something cold to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure none of my crew,
none of my friends, none of my family
[SPEAKER_00]: reach into my refrigerator and drink the
silver thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would cause them drastic
health problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is clearly labeled in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, keep it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put it in a brown paper bag,
like some bum wine, just put your clear
[SPEAKER_00]: jar in a brown bag that will protect it
from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the light is off in the fridge when
you close the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light goes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fuck with the fridge a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a single, not a single dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bachelor living alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, here by myself, the fridge doesn't get
opened a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it stays nice and cool,
dry and dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly it is, uh, it's effective for
me over that course of 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not lose its strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not lose its viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not lose its effectiveness over
that 21 day period while it is kept in my
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I'll take the,
the one, uh, the leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take out the amount that I need,
put that in my spray bottle, dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, usually I can get two applications
from one spray bottle worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using just the spray bottle that,
uh, you probably use to put cleaner in and
[SPEAKER_00]: spray the windows or some sort of,
uh, just a basic spray bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 450 milliliters is what it's
marked up to on the side of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get two applications of three
semi-large plants out of that one bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I mix it, I dilute it,
I mix it, I fill that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shake the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray, I leave that bottle sitting in a
cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's honestly in just my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area when I'm not in there, the lights in
the mix area are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a comfortable environment for a
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a decent environment
for that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, three days later, I shake the shit out
of it again, apply it to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my spray bottles empty at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when it's time to make more,
I will make the dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pour my 10 or 30, whatever percent
into the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then I'll mix the 70 or 90% dilute,
uh, distilled water into their shake the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can get once again, two more
applications out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by the time that jar, uh, that mix is
getting empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, my plants are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already done the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, the storage, they store best as
powders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They store a little less longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you mix them and dilute them,
they start to lose their, um, their shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: life is I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a chemistry major to be a hundred
percent honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, uh, from the best of
my knowledge, from what I've been taught,
[SPEAKER_00]: read and learned, uh, they do last longest
as the powder shorter as the powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get wetter and more diluted,
more dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, keep them in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them in a cool, dry, dark place,
clearly labeled, make sure that once
[SPEAKER_00]: again, if you have family, if you've got
kids, especially if you've got kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: this may be a weird detail of somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if somebody in your house drinks
alcohol, that's when we make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: silly mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put it somewhere that you cannot
accidentally drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're drunk, put it in the bottom
somewhere in the crisper drawer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just won't get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success is what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grower, that breeder, that seed
maker, that, that dipshit getting somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: sick because we didn't properly label and
or store the things we're using for our
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put that in a safe designated place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, drunk people,
young people, uh, sometimes old people,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes normal people can't fucking
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up your home up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've seen people take a ring,
a duct tape and put it right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: top, uh, just cause when people grab,
they're going to, why the fuck is our duct
[SPEAKER_00]: tape around here?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them think not to drink the silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't keep mine for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it and I make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep that 100% solution in a,
in the refrigerator and I dilute it as I
[SPEAKER_00]: need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I can get two sprays out of a
solution, out of a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is basically the storage of the
silver thiosulfate solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray with the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions was, when do I spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to spray any spray application with
the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't matter if you've got to turn
it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best if you can hit it right when the
lights go off in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can time it to where like,
you know, the lights go off at seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in there at like six 59,
you start spraying those lights go off and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can finish spraying clothes up
and get out of there real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That couple of minutes worth of spraying
those plants with silver won't disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could pull the plants out just
before nighttime, take them to another
[SPEAKER_00]: location and spray them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right as the lights go off,
return them to their home and then let
[SPEAKER_00]: them sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always spray with the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove from the grow lights or you just
don't want them under those intense lights
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when we were kids, some of us did
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch Beavis and butthead,
you saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could burn ants with a magnifying
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a bubble on your leaf when
you're spraying with the big grow light on
[SPEAKER_00]: and that intense light hits that bubble,
it could make a little burn mark on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is a thing called photo
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the things we spray on our
plants may have a photo reaction with the
[SPEAKER_00]: light with the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something may cause an interaction to
cause a problem on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not spray with the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can drag those plants out of there,
spray them right before the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right as the lights go off, put them back
in the room so they're not getting hit
[SPEAKER_00]: with that big light while they're wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to get the silver solution
on other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only want this on plants that are
going to get sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're putting them in a room with
other plants, make sure that those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that the sprayed plants are dry before you
introduce them back to the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is I usually spray and then
that first time I spray is about seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days before a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when I just spray, lights go out,
I spray, we're in veg, not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I go into flower, I will wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my I've got my room set to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come on at nine a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: or nine p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you're living.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that light will come on whenever you
got it scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how your setup is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is its first day of 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I know that that timer is about to go
off, maybe 10, 15 minutes before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go grab that plant, pull it far from
the light and spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is day one for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to spray it with the silver
solution, let it kind of dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the lights go off, I'll just
move it back to its normal spot so that
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow when the light comes on,
it's back in its home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is its first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to spray it right before the lights
go off, then put it into darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it that first day of darkness right
after that spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way I've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is when.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've covered storage of the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered when to spray, spray with
the lights off, spray in the dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure not to spray the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to pull these plants out of
the room and spray them, that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be what you're doing anyway,
because you want to flower these plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit ahead of the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be getting close to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get these male plants in a
room by themselves if you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the pollen donor plants, I should say,
in a room by themselves if you can and get
[SPEAKER_00]: them ahead of the girls when making femme
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about one of the big questions
we got was pollen collection and storage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goal here is to create feminized
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do with the pollen
once we've created that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do, I've got two separate areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a main room with a three by three
tent inside of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my girls are in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're under a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting vegged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will move my male plant into the
tent or my pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should correct my nomenclature,
my wordage here, my verbiage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female being moved to a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of them get moved to a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on their own light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll put them under 12-12 and spray
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start making pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do, I grab those pollen donor
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I know it's about time, I grab them
and I move them strategically throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: One goes right in the middle of all the
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: One goes on this end of the females
because there's an extraction fan on this
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want it to kind of pull the air right
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one kind of sits off to the
side because I'm saving that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that one to make a bunch of pollen
so that that's my backup, my second
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just put one at the edge of the
plants, at the edge of the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just let that pollen dust in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can collect the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to collect it, keep the males
in their own area, the pollen donors in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the pollen starts coming out,
you can tap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use, oftentimes I'll get a Pyrex dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Pyrex dish is much heavier than you
anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good grip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drop that bad bitch in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll break some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even the dish, it will suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the Pyrex dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a grip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a drumstick handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grab a drumstick and just tap that
plant and it'll tap the pollen right into
[SPEAKER_00]: that Pyrex dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a few taps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this every few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start giving you pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make more pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that every time you touch this
plant, pollen is going to go all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to taste gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can drag that pollen donor over to
the rest of the plant, over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: population when you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can collect the pollen by tapping
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can take that Pyrex dish and you
can straight up chop the tops off of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, your pollen donor plant,
and lay it in that Pyrex dish and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen will fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant dries, pollen will land into
your dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tap it with a drumstick,
with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smack the plant onto the dish carefully,
gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull the pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind will make you go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap that plant onto the dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen will fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important things about
pollen is let it get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture will destroy pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we're going to talk about
a lot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture destroys pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a desiccant pack,
not a Boveda pack, you want the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boveda helps you retain moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to eliminate moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing that comes in food,
like beef jerky and shit, to suck out the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come in your vitamin package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in, sometimes if you buy a new
bag or something, it'll come with this
[SPEAKER_00]: little packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to suck out moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture will destroy pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your pollen clump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make it dark yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, before you store it, pick out all of
those male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see little male flower
clusters in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all of those out because those have
moisture and they will harbor moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will attribute and contribute to
moldy conditions in your storage
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather up that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the drumstick and the Pyrex
dish method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just bend that plant over and
shake it into your dish, if that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do, but pollen is going to go
every direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do this, turn off the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help yourself out because that fan is
going to blow dust everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that the plant has gone long
enough, you can cut the tops off and put
[SPEAKER_00]: those tops in the dish and let them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it bone dry before you seal it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then store that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long your pollen will
last.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a few experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lead you astray and say
that it will last more than six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had pollen for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had pollen for a year and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had pollen for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say gather your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say dry enough times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the pollen dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about actually pollinating our
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, you could drag your
reversed plant, your pollen donor over to
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it a shake or you can let it
naturally blow across the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it pollinate that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can select a couple of branches for
your female plant and pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate just a few branches if
you're very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have the pollen in a small
container, maybe like a glass vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we would use a black film
canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've evolved since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a vial, a container of some sort with
pollen in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, remove the female plant that
you're going to pollinate from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got your female pollen
receiver in a safe place, get the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of different ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people simply take a vial of
pollen and sprinkle it right over the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if this microphone was a plant and
this, I'm going to use the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the easiest thing I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pen cap was a vial of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just took it and went tink,
tink, tink, tink and did a few circles
[SPEAKER_00]: around it and then went lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just pollinate one branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're super careful, you can grab a
branch of the plant, bend it over this
[SPEAKER_00]: way, get it right here and just go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know that this branch right
here is going to make a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make plenty of seeds from a really
small bud, a really small branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good idea at this point may be to mark
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bread tie, a ribbon,
anything you can put on this branch and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, this is where I pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know that your seeds are going to
be there when it comes to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could possibly harvest the rest of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were careful, it won't be seeded
and this one branch will have seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: your next project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow your own stuff, have a little
bit of fun with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use a paintbrush, a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could dust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could dip the paintbrush or Q-tip into
the pollen and paint it onto the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paint the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where we are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, watch the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those pistols get, you can identify
that the plant has been pollinated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols or stigmas being brown and
shriveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part will become a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says you can make a lot of
seeds with tiny, tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste a lot of time and space making
seeds for your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if these seeds are going to
be any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time you make seeds,
maybe only make 20, 30, maybe 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 of them to test them out and see if
they're worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't seed up your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they got a bunch of seeds that
aren't stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job as a breeder is to make seeds that
are better than both of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't improve upon the cannabis
line, or if you didn't reach a goal that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were trying to reach, then we didn't
do ourselves any justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do any good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moving backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make yourselves a lot of seeds
in a very small, like a closet or a micro
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred seeds in six and a half inch net
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need is a big enough plant to
receive pollen and a big enough plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollinate some plants, let the pollen
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's a useful tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are tossing pollen around,
if you don't want all of your plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: get pollen, spray them with water before
you get the pollen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just moisten them up, make it damp in the
room, wet those plants, get the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, do your pollen chucking,
let the pollen take, maybe rinse that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant off after the with water,
kill any excess pollen that didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by the pistols or by the female
plant, get the pollen off of there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then spray the other females, then put
everybody back in the room together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you should prevent pollen
contamination on the plants you did not
[SPEAKER_00]: want seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many useful tricks to use
water to keep your other plants safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spray the other females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray anything you don't want to
get seeded that may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rinse them off before you put them back
in there, spray the other girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't harvest the seeds too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know when they're done?
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds will probably take about six
weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually harvest around day 70,
sometimes 77 when my plants are seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do to make sure that my
seeds are ready is I start doing what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call a squeeze test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seed up pretty large plants so I can
risk a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do, right where the nodes are kind
of intersecting, right at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the bracts, the pistols,
or the calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the bracts or the calyx all
swollen up and there's a seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reach up and pluck a seed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to ruin too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might pull out one or two seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll it around in your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock off that hole or the husk of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examine the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What color is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it white?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it light green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it turning brown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it tiger striped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it look like a seed that you think
would be viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the next test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed should not break under the
pressure of your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it cracks, it's not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does not crack, you're getting very
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pull the seeds when they're good
and hard and I can push them on the table
[SPEAKER_00]: and they do not rupture under the pressure
of my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice, I almost have an
indention and a callus on this finger from
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing so many seeds onto this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really pull out a few and I'll do this
from multiple locations on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just pick the top because that's
obvious, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's getting the most light,
the most energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a few spots on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, just like trichomes,
the tops of the plant, the seeds are ready
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bottom needs to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in the greenhouse and the grow
space, some of the plant seeds are ready
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that come from the Platinum
Tangi are always done sooner than the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that come from Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always know that that will be a thing
that saves me the headache of having to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut down those two plants at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I run a large crop of
Platinum Tangi that I can cut that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven to ten days earlier than anything
made with the Strawberry Fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Strawberry Starburst earlier,
sorry, I may have transposed those,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do mix that up in my brain a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that the timing there,
I can help myself out by staggering those
[SPEAKER_00]: because they won't be done for a week
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can get the one down, dried,
get it chopped up into small pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then move the other one in and they
can change places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can rotate in my process,
in my processing, so I don't have to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull the seeds out, see if they're
ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm getting at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start developing the eye and the
feel to know if the seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave them too long, they'll get
too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take them too early, they won't be
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find some of your seeds are going to be
done earlier than others in one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that law of averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough that are done that it's
time to cut down the plant or do you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to wait longer and let some get too hard?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the time to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only making 30 or 40 seeds,
cut them down around day 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more
specifically about the timing of using our
[SPEAKER_00]: spray solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it one more time because
I may have gone too fast in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to spray my pollen donor seven to
10 days before I initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not initiate flower on my pollen
donor and pollen receiver plants at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next thing we're going to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I start spraying seven to 10 days
before I flip my pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a week to 10 days, I'll give it a good
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will give that plant day one of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My schedule is set nine to nine a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: or p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on which room I'm in, what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: that light comes on about 8 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go grab the pollen donor plants and I
spray them for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the light goes off at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get sprayed seven to 10 days before
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get sprayed day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is the schedule that I follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray my silver solution on day one,
day three, day six, day nine, day 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 18, and 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point I will start making game
time decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to spray again on 25?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to spray again on 27?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have never sprayed after day 30 to
be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the plants are stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a stubborn plant you may
need to go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now we should start seeing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mail will start making pollen around
day 30 or 35 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be plant specific,
light specific, phenotype specific,
[SPEAKER_00]: environment specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm saying ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say day 28 to 37 ish is when
you'll get your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the females will be ready for their
pollen around day 25 to day 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a word problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some algebra to be done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you again, expect pollen
between days 30 and 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect females to be ready around day 25
to day 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's more stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bump your pollen donor plants when
they're making pollen because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: knock the pollen out early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't have as much stuff to knock up
your females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that dust may travel to the females
and pollinate them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get hit too early you won't make
as many seeds as you could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one piece of advice that I use to set
my rhythm, I say that the females are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be ready for pollen around day 25
to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude is going to start making pollen
around 30 to 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I set my rhythm, when I see
those pollen donor plants showing me that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are truly reversing, this is a kind
of a fail safe way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your silver solution isn't
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your spray intervals,
dilutions, ratios, timing aren't right for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivar you've chosen to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, I wait until I see that
female plant showing me true signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: successful reversal before I drag my
female plants into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all it sets up the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that once I see that part start
developing I know I'm just the right time
[SPEAKER_00]: away for that plant to give me pollen to
where the girls are going to get timed up
[SPEAKER_00]: just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also this helps me not put female plants
into flower when I don't have a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I failed, if I didn't make my silver
solution properly, if I did not reverse at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right time, spray correctly,
if I've done fucked up, I've got a backup
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, I still have my females and veg,
I can get that pollen donor plant and do
[SPEAKER_00]: other tricks and methods and tactics to
try to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I don't just have plants in there
flowering, not making seeds, scrambling,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure shit out because I've
been there, won't do it again,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sucks, I'm better than that at this
point and so are you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until you see that pollen donor plant
showing successful signs of reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then drag those female plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here comes the next part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to harvest our seeds around
day 70 or 75, maybe day 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a full episode in the
future about harvesting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will count for feminized seeds,
regular seeds, auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you're going to harvest seeds this
will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get those female plants, get the male
plants, the pollen donors, about 7 to 15
[SPEAKER_00]: days ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect pollen around day 30 to 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the females ready for pollen around
day 25 to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're going to do an open
pollination where you're going to drag
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen donor in there and just let it
skeet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're going to cut down
the top and walk around and beat the
[SPEAKER_00]: females with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're going to gather
pollen and then get the girls going at
[SPEAKER_00]: another time and sprinkle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your tactic but do some
pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there, get that pollen going on the
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then be patient and wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any notes about feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeded plants are going to want more
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed my seeded plants basically a souped
up veg mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed what I'm feeding my veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do add amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add a liquid amino product from what's
that company called?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, the company my brain would not
bring to my mind is called Microbe Life
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make an amino product that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like that photosynthesis plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I add amino to my seeded crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also step up the cow mag and a little
bit of the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't focus on bud boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will shift later on to the the flowering
feed but I don't focus on bud boosters
[SPEAKER_00]: like we do when we're making buds because
I'm not making buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focused on making the building blocks
for life and I do believe that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of those amino acids a lot of nitrogen
