I want to mention one thing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: audio podcast services have been messed up
Long story short my website got messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care about this Details a
service provider changed a thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: messed up all of my things things got
weird My web guy is working diligently to
[SPEAKER_00]: solve the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that there is a problem
until somebody tells us I didn't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: the show wasn't on stitcher Google podcast
Spotify It wasn't showing up in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working to correct that It should
be corrected by the time this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out The thing is every time we
correct one thing we find that something
[SPEAKER_00]: else is messed up So we're playing the fix
the internet game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize if you've missed it I did
not mean to abandon you.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just realizing that if you're not
finding the show you're not even gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: the message It's like calling somebody who
left their phone at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro, your phones at my house The
phone is just ringing on my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward into
something useful in this podcast I
[SPEAKER_00]: recently attended a great event I attended
the groovy gravy secret stash seed
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange event in Denver, Colorado That
was a beautiful event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a low-key event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of low-key I would guess there
were somewhere between three and five
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred people at the whole event,
which was not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great for I was kind of calling
it a practice run like getting back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment reentry I haven't been to
an event to a concert to a comedy show any
[SPEAKER_00]: big sort of gatherings since March 12th or
13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the last comedy show that was at
the Comedy Works downtown in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last show was Bobby Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't had A big show in that
building since then they have now by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you hear this some socially distant
shows But there haven't been any big shows
[SPEAKER_00]: events anything like that for me to go to
so it was exciting to get out This was
[SPEAKER_00]: just a small event Most of the time I take
two or three people to a big event to help
[SPEAKER_00]: me out this time It was Mike and myself
big shout to Mike for helping me kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: small event But that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm getting at I needed a
small event for reentry to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with people again How to be at an
event environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so long that I kind of forgot
Once we got there, we totally fell right
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rhythm though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just just like old times The drive
up was super smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a three hour drive from where
Mike and I were To actually get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: event pretty uneventful drive We had a
good talk on the way up there Mike and I
[SPEAKER_00]: am just have really good conversation
Probably should have recorded that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys would have appreciated that Drive up
was smooth parking and load-in were super
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dedicated parking spot for us
Not a spot but a parking lot the lot was
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of spots for us we can get in there
and get a Good clean parking space
[SPEAKER_00]: actually dropped a mic off right in front
of the event with all of our merchandise
[SPEAKER_00]: who drove over parked Walked back not a
big deal short walk to get right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: event Getting in was cool setting up was
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow of the event was super smooth So
let's talk about how the event happened we
[SPEAKER_00]: got set up and then about 20 minutes
before the doors were gonna open we were
[SPEAKER_00]: told hey the VIPs are going to be allowed
to enter in just a few minutes if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do anything now is your chance so Mike
got a drink and a snack I've used the
[SPEAKER_00]: men's room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got ourselves organized and then
the VIPs were allowed in VIPs were allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to hang out all day if you bought
a VIP ticket for this event you were
[SPEAKER_00]: included all day However after the VIPs
there were time slots The time slots went
[SPEAKER_00]: from noon to 1 and then you were allowed
to come in the building with your
[SPEAKER_00]: wristband or with your ticket you were
allowed entry from noon to 1 to shop at
[SPEAKER_00]: the booths then when your time slot was
almost up they would run around and there
[SPEAKER_00]: were a couple of guys just politely Saying
hey, there's about 10 minutes left in your
[SPEAKER_00]: time slot Please wrap up your shopping and
then head outside when you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you got done you could go outside and
There were other booths outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly didn't make it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were food trucks There were a lot of
people on a DJ out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard honestly didn't make it There was
a massage booth out there that people were
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back in and saying man that massage
was fucking great So shout out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: massage lady But so you would come in
you'd get an hour to shop and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: politely remind you that your time is up
and you'd be escorted out to that back
[SPEAKER_00]: Area which was outside once you were
outside you could hang out and socialize
[SPEAKER_00]: and hang out and I don't know if there was
Consumption happening out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said you could consume don't want
to snitch on anybody if that was not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed allegedly Maybe people were
smoking out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were allowed one hour to shop,
which was kind of cool There were about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: booths I'm gonna say 10 to 12 ish booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do a real solid headcount
Obviously there about 10 or 12 booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those booths were breeders right
in my little section where my booth was
[SPEAKER_00]: set up it was only seeds in the corner and
then myself and then another group that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a Seed seller of they were a retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had a lot of other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of that calic seed company
They had some of my seeds They just had
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from a bunch of other vendors or
other breeders over there and they were a
[SPEAKER_00]: reseller vending other seeds Which is
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with that There was also
right across from me looking straight at
[SPEAKER_00]: their booth all day was top dogs a big
shout out to JJ and top dog also shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Oni Shout out to my booth neighbors to
the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot Remember their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it written down on a paper didn't
bring that paper with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Also down the row was Capulator
Capulator seeds and I think it's Rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain High that he rolls with that crew
was down the way There were a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: great booths also Tiki Ti can't see I
wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left that paper another room Tiki
something Tiki madness Tiki maniac
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that They seemed cool good
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of traffic at their booth I
think crop King's new invention by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way, let's mention that crop King has
changed their name you guys if you If you
[SPEAKER_00]: know about the if you know about crop King
beware They've also changed their name to
[SPEAKER_00]: rocket seeds rocket seeds is also crop
King seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not work with them I do not support
them I do not endorse them if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming to have my seeds that is
fraudulent Be careful where you're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds from it's all I need to say
about that But crop King is also now
[SPEAKER_00]: rocket seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think they were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a booth I didn't realize who that
was until later on when I realized they
[SPEAKER_00]: changed their names, but it was kind of
cool It was a cool setup event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people got to come in they got an hour
to shut down And then they got moved out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the outside area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew that they got an hour So there
was from noon to one got to shop and then
[SPEAKER_00]: from one to 130 It was basically just VIPs
in the building and the VIPs have already
[SPEAKER_00]: been to my booth a couple of times They've
shopped they've chatted they've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: their fist bumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that 30-minute break between
Groups between waves that would give us
[SPEAKER_00]: time to just regroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take a drink of water Reorganize
my booth check my phone use the restroom
[SPEAKER_00]: if I needed to go get a bagel if I wanted
one because that bagels there for us Go
[SPEAKER_00]: get a coffee if we wanted one just
whatever you need it You can get like a
[SPEAKER_00]: good 20 or 30 minute break and that's kind
of cool because when I go to an event I Am
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mickey Mouse of my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm my face is on the package
people don't come there No offense Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody came there to talk to Mike Some
people do but 90% of the people that come
[SPEAKER_00]: to my booth want to talk to me and that's
understandable So I don't get to leave the
[SPEAKER_00]: booth very often But when you got a minute
break there in the middle You know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can just go use the restroom and no one's
gonna come up to the booth and be
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointed that they didn't get to meet
Rasta Jeff because They really do try to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet everybody try to shake everybody's
hands If you want a selfie a high-five a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture if you want me to autograph some
shit I'll do it because I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: without the people that support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm grateful and thankful and I like to
Oblige and be cordial to the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have supported me I'm successful because
of those people but they're successful
[SPEAKER_00]: what there grows because of what we're
giving each other so it works out I Really
[SPEAKER_00]: like that flow is a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good I keep rambling about
this event because I was Excited it was
[SPEAKER_00]: good just to be at an event Standing in my
booth is just a good feeling got the irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics flag behind me I got the banner
at the table that says the website and has
[SPEAKER_00]: my face on it We got shirts hung up people
are coming up and telling us How good of a
[SPEAKER_00]: job we do with the seeds and how good of a
job we do with the podcast Somebody told
[SPEAKER_00]: me that they've been growing for several
years like maybe eight or ten years I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they said and then they discovered
the podcast two years ago and they said
[SPEAKER_00]: that their crop has never been better
They're putting out a better product
[SPEAKER_00]: better weights They're way more successful
and they're having more fun and spending
[SPEAKER_00]: less time doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them I said honestly, bro that
Statement means more to me than all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sales I've made today because I we sold
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We I'm not gonna lie We sold some seeds at
that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.

and most you guys are gonna say well
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not smoking the right rosin or
they're not doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I know and most you guys to say
that you give me rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like shit also I think a lot of
the times it tastes like a popsicle stick
[SPEAKER_00]: or burnt popcorn Let's recap and head back
to my buddy Neil.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me this lemon Jeffrey live rosin
Apparently I liked it because look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is zero It is finito fin the end throw
it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Kept it because it still smells amazing
and this was my reminder to talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show This lemon Jeffrey live rosin
was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have the negative flavors the
negative things I usually experience when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking rosin this was delicious I If
I had paid money I didn't this was a gift
[SPEAKER_00]: if I had paid money for this I would go
back and buy more That's how much I
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neil if you're listening, bro Had a
great time talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we made friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do social media, which blows my
fucking mind Send me a message bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're getting a big shout out on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your concentrate was amazing Lemon Jeffrey
is quite possibly one of my top three
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's named After me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Jeffrey in lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah That's one of my favorites,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a really good job I would I'd
probably I'd buy that I got lost in
[SPEAKER_00]: sidetracked on what I was saying talking
about how good that concentrate was But I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, hopefully hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have social media though So
that's weird then I was given another gift
[SPEAKER_00]: by proxy big shout out to my friend Jeremy
for the delicious Strawberry starburst
[SPEAKER_00]: number six and number five and then also
big shout out to Justin For being the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitator of that product Jeremy
couldn't make it to the event He was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to send three jars of concentrate
with our friend to make sure they made it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the booth Same story here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally don't dab rosin But this
number six the jar is empty dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is empty It smells It's got some tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little clementine to it,
but then it's got like a strawberry like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fake strawberry candy strawberry incense
sort of thing going on to it and This one
[SPEAKER_00]: did not last long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell that jar is empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got scrape marks in it I was trying
to get the final dabs out of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was number six There was number five
and I think there was also number three
[SPEAKER_00]: number three is gone non-existent and then
I think there might be Just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sap left in number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Jeremy dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff was delicious Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would dab that all day long super terpy
super delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't leave Any weirdness on my nail
didn't make me cough didn't make me choke
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I noticed about smoking rosin
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke bho I smoke diamonds and sauce and
primarily batters The rosins are heavy on
[SPEAKER_00]: my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need as big of a dab I still take
as big of a dab But it feels like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: weight on my chest for a minute after I
smoke it I kind of enjoy it Also,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of fucking freaks me out getting
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I like that weight on my
chest feeling I don't need a fucking heart
[SPEAKER_00]: attack or a stroke at this age anyway Big
thanks and big shout out to everybody for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the great gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to easy Oh five seven.

[SPEAKER_00]: And he said I've got everything and I said

able to give my friend a shirt or a
[SPEAKER_00]: hoodie, but he had all the seeds So big

several times Jake would come and shop and
[SPEAKER_00]: then do a lap and then realize I've still

[SPEAKER_00]: being a breeding project in the future
Also, I want to send a big shout out to DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicka T I haven't seen Nicka T in a long
time We used to be at all the same events
[SPEAKER_00]: when there were cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be there DJ Nicka T is the I
think he's the owner and founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: essential extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least he was at one point That's how I
knew him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was DJ Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that guy from essential extracts Used
to be the other guy with dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's cut his dreads off now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not following the trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it But DJ Nicka T showed up and
DJ Nicka T set the vibe for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful Mike was like I hope we
don't have to listen to sublime all day
[SPEAKER_00]: and I get it Mike's not really a reggae
fan Mike's not a sublime kind of fan and
[SPEAKER_00]: when the DJ started playing reggae Mike
kind of looked at me like oh It's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae all day But a few songs in he
blended reggae with some other stuff with
[SPEAKER_00]: some good reggae with some other stuff
Mike's Not a reggae fan and he actually
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed the musical vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like they were playing a playlist
for me So big shout out to DJ Nicka T Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: and coconut water you guys it was really
exciting to be at events again I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling about an event because I wanted
to recap it and talk about it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't gone out and done Something like
that in such a long time that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also made me realize I Need to update
my booth The booth looked good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it could be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the guys have more professional
booths I saw a couple of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired Me some ideas that I'm definitely
going to I'm gonna steal your ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see business that works and you copy
things that work and you ditch ideas that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't work So what we're doing here saw
great a couple of ways just to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: booth flow improve The efficiency of the
booth and lessen the environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do less paper at the booth I
know that's some hippie shit, but there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be less paper less takeaway stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll all be digital The world's digital
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so thanks to everybody who came
out to the Event I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to wolf for throwing the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to micro life hydro for hosting us
And then big thanks to everybody who was a
[SPEAKER_00]: partner in crime at the event We had a
great time and thanks to everybody who

everybody big shout out to Katie and
[SPEAKER_00]: Peterson and your new and your partner in
crime there It's good to see you Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of people to give shout outs
felt like the the BET Awards or something
[SPEAKER_00]: here Somebody did say that I do too many
shout outs at the start of the show for
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon those folks actually Pay a patreon
tier where I promise to give them a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the show So if I didn't shout them
out I would be a dick and I do it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first minute of the show If you don't want
to hear the commercial and the shout outs
[SPEAKER_00]: hit that skip button when you don't hear
music anymore The shout outs are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the way it works The music
and the shout outs last about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time and also the podcast is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome Um, where are we gonna go
from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, once again, I wrote down Thanks for
being patient while we fix and refix and
[SPEAKER_00]: refix all of the podcast servers if you've
missed episodes I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's driving me crazy as well,
but we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my web guy I think he listens
to the show if you hear this bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Everybody appreciates you Not just
me the people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all appreciate you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to move on to the main topic of
this podcast I've been talking for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna be a long show This portion
of the show is brought to you by my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: kes Burton Shout out to my buddy kes
Burton.
[SPEAKER_00]: This topic is going to be seed storage We
sold a bunch of seeds at the seed event I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot of messages about how to store
seeds I felt like this would be a great
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate episode to segue the seed
event into seed Storage, perhaps you went
[SPEAKER_00]: to an event this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you've been shopping online
Perhaps you're headed to the events that
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming up and you've got a bunch of
seeds What do I do with my seeds as a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder as a seed seller?
[SPEAKER_00]: my number one recommendation for what you
do with your seeds is to Guess what grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make seeds for you to put them in
a fucking vault I don't want those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in a fucking desk drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want those seeds in your safe I
would prefer not to see them in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking junk drawer or your underwear
drawer or wherever you keep them in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge I want you to put them in the dirt
depending on your location and your
[SPEAKER_00]: legalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics is not responsible for a
violation of Growing laws or rules or
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, but if you're in a safe legal
place I really want you to get them wet
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them in the fucking dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to store them However,
I do appreciate love and respect and
[SPEAKER_00]: admire that people are buying my seed
packages and keeping them like baseball
[SPEAKER_00]: cards They treat them like a Pokemon Card,
I got to get them all and as a seller of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that I have no complaints if you're
gonna put those in a drawer I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be excited about that But let's talk
about a way to safely and effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term store these seeds seeds are not
cheap Seeds do not last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pride myself in being one of the
more affordable seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I saw some prices this weekend I've
seen some prices online and you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staying very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to take all of your money I
just need to get paid for my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need you know, we're not trying to
get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just Trying to live over here make
sure everybody's fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some some sneakers will be alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm rambling but you've got
expensive seeds You want to keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep them safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep them stored?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best way to store these seeds
for long term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the seeds that you buy are going
to be in a package.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be in some sort of a sealed
package already I'm looking across the
[SPEAKER_00]: table JJ sells his seeds and that like
mylar package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be vacuum sealed or at least
heat sealed I'm looking at Lovin in her
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes has quite an extravagant package,
but on the inside those are sealed inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of a little vial My seeds come in a disc
with the foam padding on the inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: disc to keep the seeds from rattling
around Those are inside of a baggie with
[SPEAKER_00]: the folded card insert that baggie is heat
sealed So most of the seeds are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be sealed in a good package already The
first thing I would suggest is maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: putting your seeds if you've got a lot of
packs You're trying to seal get one box
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them all in one box that does seal
I've got for my Small personal stash that
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm gonna I think I'm gonna run
I've got a it's a grateful dead lunchbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those metal lunchboxes It
doesn't seal super tight, but it seals
[SPEAKER_00]: enough for me and all those seeds are
already sealed So I'm comfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: that for my personal little storage stash
my uh, my nostalgic seed vault if you will
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend something that is
airtight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make those little All the head shops
used to have them in the late 90s early
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in high school It's what we kept
all our shit in just a little airtight
[SPEAKER_00]: stash box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just got a Rubber grommet around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a metal box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably got lead zeppelin or insane
clown posse or something fucking printed
[SPEAKER_00]: on it Maybe you got to pock on yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know But what we need to do is
make an irie genetics seed stash box just
[SPEAKER_00]: like that If you know how to do that,
if you were the person that does that,
[SPEAKER_00]: please contact me We will hook you the
fuck up because everybody out there is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want to buy an irie genetics seed
stash box Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a stash box something that could
be airtight not super airtight isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: critical I like the airtight so we're
gonna put the seeds in the airtight Box is
[SPEAKER_00]: the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where do we put that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people putting their seeds
in the refrigerator Let me talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about that because I'm gonna say put
your seeds in a cool dry dark place And
[SPEAKER_00]: people are gonna say that's the
refrigerator or the crisper drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool Also, I don't like the
freezer that's going to fall into this
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about if you put Anything in the
crisper drawer anything in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets cold in there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates moisture inside that package
then you take that Out now that moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: has to go somewhere that condensation is
inside of that package You've got moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: moving around inside of your package
possibly inside of your seed package what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Germinates your seeds is moisture so you
can create a condensation issue by putting
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds in the fridge and taking them
out or putting them in the freezer and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking them out too frequently if You do
choose to store your seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator or in the freezer Put them in
there and leave them there for a while if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the kind of person That likes to
pull out your seeds and marvel at your
[SPEAKER_00]: collection or show off your seeds to your
friends I don't recommend putting them in
[SPEAKER_00]: that deep of a cold in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Recommend just a cool dry dark
environment Perhaps you live in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got a basement Maybe you've got
a back dark corner of that basement where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put a safe put those seeds in that
safe That will stay cool in the basement
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays about 75 degrees ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get a little bit colder In the
winter it may get a little bit hotter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer But if you got the normal house
environment happening It's gonna stay
[SPEAKER_00]: about 75 down there in the basement
Because you got the heater upstairs
[SPEAKER_00]: running the house to keep it warm or you
got the cooler keeping it cool It's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of adjust the downstairs the house
stays insulated pretty good temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: down there find that back secure corner
Nobody knows how to find put your safe
[SPEAKER_00]: with your seeds back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice and secure cool dry dark safe
environment also a safe environment
[SPEAKER_00]: something that nobody could get to because
you don't want people stealing your
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive freaking seeds Heat in my
opinion is one of the best ways to destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: and degrade the lifespan of a seed So keep
those seeds cool the cooler the better to
[SPEAKER_00]: a point You don't want to get them so cold
that they rupture and explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing to talk about Super
dry seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to dry my seeds really really dry
before I send them to anybody something We
[SPEAKER_00]: did discover is that if you don't dry the
seeds enough I was having an issue that
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds going to one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting complaints on it seeds I
sent to another Direction I didn't get any
[SPEAKER_00]: complaints about and I was like how come
everybody on the East Coast is having
[SPEAKER_00]: germination issues with this new batch of
seeds Everybody on the West Coast their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about it It's the middle of
winter the seeds going that way or fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing the seeds going that way or just
fine Then I thought there's freezing and
[SPEAKER_00]: erupting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably erupting in cargo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably on a plane They're
getting too cold and they're bursting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plane in the cargo So I've started
drying the seeds a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them with what is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a boat Veda it's a the silicate
pack that just sucks up all the moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the number written down at the
point I want to get it below once I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: below that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they won't rupture in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they won't rupture in cargo They
won't rupture if they get too cold makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds a little bit safer This is how
much thought we were putting into keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds safe and fresh to get them to
the grower we want you to have success if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have success with my seeds you
can email me and Over time eventually you
[SPEAKER_00]: will get a replacement pack if you've got
a good reason if you didn't fuck them up
[SPEAKER_00]: being completely stupid I'd rather have
Good customer service and eat a pack than
[SPEAKER_00]: you hate me and spread fucking shit on the
internet about me because I do care about
[SPEAKER_00]: you So dry seeds is the main idea keep
them nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna cool dry dark place Don't
freeze them heat will ruin them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't prefer them in the freezer
extremes of either way I don't think are
[SPEAKER_00]: good if you got to go extreme one way cold
is the best if you think about it They
[SPEAKER_00]: probably fell out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They landed they stayed in the snow the
snow melted It became water that water
[SPEAKER_00]: germinated the seed it grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the cold is preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not as bad as heat All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to recap, I really recommend a cool dry
dark place If you insist on putting them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the refrigerator, I do recommend you
put them in that crisper drawer Try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them dry put them in an airtight
container if you're going to put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: there Once again, I don't recommend the
freezer if you're going to take them out
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them back If you're the kind of
person that wants to show them off just a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool dry dark place Like a corner in the
basement a shelf in the basement something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that something no one's gonna get to
None of your pets are gonna find them and
[SPEAKER_00]: eat them Something else I want to talk
about is when you're storing these seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that they are Labeled they have
a name on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in the original breeder
packaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you write the name on a baggie?
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time you touch it you're rubbing
that name off with your thumb and in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years You won't even know what those seeds
are think about how well labeled and
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed those seeds are also write down the
date of when you put those in there so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how long you've had those seeds
around then also are they regular or
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds I would write that down on
the packaging as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to include as many details As I can
in a package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be a little bit excessive I
claim to be sort of a cannabis historian
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm documenting cannabis I talk a lot
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I argue a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be correct So I try to make a
lot of details in the future This cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is going to be talked about the
revolution of cannabis how cannabis became
[SPEAKER_00]: legal in some areas and we had medical
cannabis and the growing and the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this culture will be talked about
this will be We're pioneers if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: this right now You are a pioneer and I was
here from a lot of the beginning of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff And so it's kind of my
responsibility with the way my brain works
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I talk to people with this show
platform It's kind of my responsibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that history and cannabis war
and all of that stuff stays accurate I
[SPEAKER_00]: just had a a lace wing a baby lace wing
crawl on my arm So my IPM is working
[SPEAKER_00]: because it jumped from this plant onto my
arm a little baby lace wing freaked me out
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it Yeah, beneficial insects are the
way to go Yeah, if you ever seen a little
[SPEAKER_00]: baby lacing it looked like a little
crocodile It's like a little tiny dinosaur
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the ugliest little bugs ever and
then it turns into a lace wing I got
[SPEAKER_00]: totally distracted by feeling that bug
climb up my arm But I think I have made my
[SPEAKER_00]: point for most of this episode because I
really do not remember where I was So I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that is a good point just to start
wrapping up the podcast you guys I want to
