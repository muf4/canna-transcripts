[SPEAKER_00]: Boo!
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Thursday, it is Halloween,
and it is time for episode 476 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.

or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of Fatso Full
Spectrum Extract from our friends at Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of GMO and Legend OG on
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as dark roast,
garlic, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to agree with that because
I am too stoned to argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really loving the gassy flavor and the
pungent aroma from this Fatso Full
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum Extract, and it's obviously got
me super baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a few
emails from a couple of our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I'd like to do a few
shout outs to a few people who support us
[SPEAKER_00]: on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big giant Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout out, and thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to our buddy James Brown.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I did say I was
going to read some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in this episode goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, thank you for your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're welcome and thank you for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I have a question for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cocoa based organic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My media is cocoa that is heavily amended
with crab shell, bone meal, green sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: The media gets recycled and reamended then
put into 20 gallon fabric pots for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an issue with a magnesium deficiency
because of the recycled cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have corrected this by rebuffering and
soaking the media with MAG from cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: edge solutions and adding some dolomite
lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is about seedlings and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's back up before we get to the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are using cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are trying to stay organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are recycling your cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are rebuffering it because you've
had what you assume is a magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cocoa, those nutrients aren't going to
stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rinse out of your media really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very likely you were getting a
magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you have corrected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very unique blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody else that is using
purely cocoa as their base and then
[SPEAKER_00]: amending it with things like crab shell,
bone meal, and green sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks are using some sort of a peat
or a soilless mix to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find this to be a rather unique mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's focus more on the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question is about seedlings and
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had any issues before my magnesium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while that was happening, I could not
get anything to clone or root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's because of the lower
cation exchange with the stripped cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you were experiencing this
deficiency, which we will assume was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a calcium and magnesium
deficiency, they're usually going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: together, you were having problems getting
your clones to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not sure if you mean you were
trying to root your clones directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cocoa mix, because that I would never
suggest trying to root clones directly
[SPEAKER_00]: into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are much more options that are much
more successful for taking clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that is what is giving you the
problem, then I would recommend moving to
[SPEAKER_00]: either an easy cloner or if you're
insistent on keeping it organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can move right over to the the rapid
rooters or whatever type of plugs and use
[SPEAKER_00]: the dome setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would not suggest going directly
into cocoa to attempt to cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may not be what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk the other route.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be experiencing problems when you
were cutting clones into rapid rooters,
[SPEAKER_00]: into a dome, however you're doing it,
from these plants which experienced that
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that you were talking
about the clone donor plants were the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that experienced this deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took clones from those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not up to their optimal health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very likely that those clones
will become stagnant and not root well for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to hope and assume that that
is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had that deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took clones from a plant that was
unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those clones were like, no,
I came from an unhealthy environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough of a start to survive
this stressful period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just burned out and died on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't matter what your media
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are unhealthy and you take
cuts from them, they are probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be struggle bud the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not sure if you were trying to
root into the cocoa, which again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is your issue, then I would
recommend moving over to the plug or
[SPEAKER_00]: another type of a cloning setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were taking clones from those
plants that experienced the deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that the problem was
unhealthy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only solution is to nurse those
plants back to health and then take clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the clones from the
healthier mother plants will work better
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person did not sign the email with
their name, but they said, thanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay lifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, I will stay lifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to send me an update to
this question, maybe a part two,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let me know if you were trying to
clone off of a plant that was unhealthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you were actually trying to clone
directly into the amended cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we could sort out your question and
get you a more dialed in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I want to thank you for the
great email and let's keep moving through
[SPEAKER_00]: the pile of great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great opening line.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, they thanked us for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome stuff I'm doing with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the education I'm spreading
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome that you notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for listening all the way up
there in the middle of nowhere Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a lot of people say, it is hard
for them to get reliable information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned before that a lot of stuff
on the internet will steer you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: completely wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do understand that finding reliable,
accurate information can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you have found the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, So far, I've read a few grow
books and Bibles, as well as TLO,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just starting on the teaming with
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make sure you check out the
teaming with series.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's teaming with microbes,
teaming with nutrients, and there might be
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that I'm missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of it, but let's just keep
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from all of that, I tend to listen
to your show in the afternoons and the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude grow show in the mornings while I
work in the trades as a painter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at the dude
grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not listening to the dude grow
show, make sure you find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're listening to my podcast,
the dude grow show is available there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just type in dude grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend is listening to this podcast
in the afternoons and the dude grows in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning while painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you were getting a
cannabis education while you were at work
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the clock and you were absorbing
useful knowledge, bettering yourself while
[SPEAKER_00]: making a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great way to do life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, on that note, between both shows,
I've gotten to dispel a few bad pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: info I've gotten from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that in Saskatchewan,
our farming culture leads people to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really stubborn and suggestive about their
bullshit gardening miracle solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a lot of people do things that their
uncle's brother taught them and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know why they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just heard some shit and they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I say, why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, well, my uncle said,
and I go, yeah, but do you see any results
[SPEAKER_00]: from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, well, my uncle said that my
brother said that when they did it and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no real scientific background or
no reason, it's just another step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may actually be causing more problems
than it's helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do see a lot of bullshit gardening
miracle solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, for example, last night I popped
into your live feed on Instagram and I
[SPEAKER_00]: asked you about dipping the root ball into
boiling water before hanging the plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You immediately said that that is an old
wives' tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard that for a long time now,
that when you cut down the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you dunk the root ball in boiling
water, it makes more trichomes appear on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't really make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it did work, why would you
want a bunch of unripened trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had those trichomes on that plant
for weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been getting ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been checking them with the scope,
making sure they're amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we want fresh trichomes on there
suddenly at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, bullshit not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I was also told another trick of
watering your plants with carbonated water
[SPEAKER_00]: for extra CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that again is just craziness that
doesn't actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering your plants with carbonated water
will not increase CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots do not want CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots want oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing that all wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are perfect examples of some of the
things that will cause more problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow than they will actually help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be very careful where we get
our information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but despite all of this,
I have managed to keep my first grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: failing and I've got a few BC blueberry
plants rocking and I'm just about to flip
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wish I had found your podcast
earlier as I would have avoided a few
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's very okay that you have made a
few mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know not what not to do next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have seen what happens when you do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, maybe I shouldn't try that
again or maybe I could try that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's okay to make mistakes,
especially at your stage of the learning
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a white belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a long way to go before you're
a black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make a lot more mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's keep going with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says anyways, instead of asking you
questions about my specific grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to pick your brain about a few
larger concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, being a lighting spectrum
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you mentioned that the sun puts
the plants to sleep because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum it generates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you rigged up three lights
with dimmer switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: One light with the blue spectrum comes on
using the dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets brighter, the middle light with
the white spectrum turns on.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the blue spectrum dims off,
a red spectrum light comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as the day goes on, the white light
dims off, leaving only the red spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: which again will shut off using the dimmer
toward the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am new to your podcast, but has this
been covered on an episode of yours?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, are there any advantages of trying
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about what
this person is referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I have talked about
far red light spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun sets, it puts off a spectrum,
what is called far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That far red light spectrum triggers a
hormone and a protein in the plant known
[SPEAKER_00]: as phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hormone tells the plant it is
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there is still light in the
sky, that plant is being told it is sleepy
[SPEAKER_00]: time, so it shuts down and starts doing
its nighttime productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that hormone in that plant triggers a
protein in that plant, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: triggered by a certain spectrum that comes
from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this listener is asking if they can set
up different Kelvin rating lights to
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt to simulate the rising,
the midday, and the sunset spectrums of
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good idea, and this would
work very well in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing we need to focus more carefully
on is specific spectrums of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put the plants to sleep, I do believe
we need a specific UV spectrum of lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: that does not come from our standard
fluorescents or our HID lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people I know putting out a light
with that spectrum at this time are
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum King.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends from Canon may have produced a
light with the same spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be other brands out there
putting out the light with the far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: feature, but to the best of my knowledge,
at this time, Spectrum King is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: brand offering that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm saying I may be wrong,
and by the time this episode comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: or by the time you listen to this episode,
there could be five, 10, or 20 new brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been launched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your idea would work in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we need to dial in the specific
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that your basic red T5 light
or T8 light or any type of HID light is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to produce that red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you dial in the perfect spectrum
for that far-red lighting to trigger that
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red response, I think that
would probably be possibly more stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant than it would be beneficial
to change that light spectrum throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the day like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more common practice is to use a bluer
bulb during the veg phase because we want
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to stay short and stocky,
and then toward the flowering phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: we usually tend to move toward the redder
bulbs because that encourages fatter bud
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of cases now, we are seeing mixed
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing high pressure sodium bulbs
in flower rooms with a few metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs in flower rooms just to add to the
spectrum, and then I'm also seeing people
[SPEAKER_00]: put ceramic metal halides in rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also seeing LEDs, and then I'm seeing
mixtures and combinations of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like these combos don't
work because of the patterns in which the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are laid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like it's a bit overkill,
but sometimes I do see really great
[SPEAKER_00]: results from rooms that are thought out
with mixed spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your idea is great in theory,
but if you are not dialing in the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: red light spectrum, it is not worth the
energy because it is not going to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: the phytochrome red response you are
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, now lastly,
and I'm sorry, I know this is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: long-winded, but because of my issues with
getting bad info in my area, my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were getting sick, and I was almost ready
to quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was on the road with my band,
and I tried to purchase some legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He names the company here, but I'm going
to leave their name out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to purchase legal cannabis from a
company, and it was fucking atrocious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also says, it happened to be
one of my favorite strains, which was sour
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sucks when you go to the store and
you try to buy your favorite strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is atrocious, is the word this
person used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, All day I was thinking how I can
get involved and fix this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then suddenly an opportunity to work at a
growth store presented itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it great how life just seems to open
doors for you like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The message keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've heard you say that you get
out of this plant what you put into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know that that is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question to you is, what would you
like to see in a growth store or even a
[SPEAKER_00]: growth store employee, and what kind of
practices do you think should be promoted?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking for product
recommendations or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering if you were to go into
a growth store, what would really impress
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up by saying, Being Canadian,
I will apologize again for the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: novel of an email here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all the information I'm able to
share, and that comes from good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also says, hearing you talk on your
show and then finding out you're also a
[SPEAKER_00]: drummer, I just had to get these couple of
things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly just a big thank you, but also to
see your thoughts on these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they say thanks again for everything,
and they signed their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name set
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you to my new Canadian
drummer friend who has a new job at a
[SPEAKER_00]: growth store, who wants to know what do I
find valuable in a growth store or a
[SPEAKER_00]: growth store employee?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes when I go to the growth store,
I run into the same exact problems I run
[SPEAKER_00]: into when I go to the music store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a very experienced and confident
grower, and I'm a very experienced and
[SPEAKER_00]: confident drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to the store to update or
replace my gear, I know what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shopped around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walk in there and I say,
Hey, I would like to buy product F6355,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the person at the counter looks at you
with an attitude and goes, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you like F6355?
[SPEAKER_00]: That brand sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you are,
you get a different attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the growth store, they go, bro,
I use this and my growth comes out way
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a guitar center,
they fucking twirl their hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, bro, I play these and they sound
way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody goes in there and they know
what they want confidently, get it off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf and sell them extra shit to go
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell them their product sucks ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody walks in and wants to buy
something and they have got cash,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take their fucking cash and give them
the product they asked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever belittle your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your customers are paying your rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's buying a product you do
not approve of, if you think you can help
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody increase the potential of their
grow, let them purchase the product that
[SPEAKER_00]: they choose to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next time you see them say,
Hey, I saw you were buying Fox Farms and
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know Fox Farms is like entry level
grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say there's this new company and they
offer this and we're going to have a sale
[SPEAKER_00]: on this product next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you may be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them why it would be a step up from
whatever they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't belittle their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them buy what they want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then next time suggest the step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't belittle, encourage growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably the first most
important piece of advice that comes to my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't belittle me because of the products
I want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't tell me how your product is
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't just try to put yourself on me
while I'm shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there for me to buy shit for my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make me feel like I'm the important one
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your customer feel like the important
one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get a very good cultivation knowledge
and have a good glossary of terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the proper words to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the parts of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what you're selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to sell people shit just to make
commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell them what you think they will need
and they will come back and buy more shit
[SPEAKER_00]: from you and you will still make your
commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't force feed anybody any product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of what I'm telling you I have
learned in basic sales schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of time, learn your products and
always have a good, better, and best
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I walk in and I say, hey, I need
something to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, oh, here's the section where we keep
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the middle priced one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make my decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't force feed me a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that I'm going for the one in
the middle and I may need something to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with that, be a good sales guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go, oh, if you're going to get that,
you may also want this to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I get to the register,
that's when you've got the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: upsell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have personal protective equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have gloves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have goggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have a face mask?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always shit to upsell,
but make sure you get what I need before
[SPEAKER_00]: you upsell me on some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just try to get money out of my
pocket without sending me out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me out of the grocery store
with a smile, I'll spend all my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you bother me and you upset my
shopping experience, I won't give you any
[SPEAKER_00]: of my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go somewhere where they do it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is probably some of the best
advice I can give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just basic sales school stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be in there to steal money from
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be in there to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be there to help people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pitch products because a company
told you to pitch a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pitch a product because you believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody doesn't want that,
have another solution, another option for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another great piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever be afraid to say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody comes in and they're trying to
tell you they've got a problem or ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: for some sort of advice and you don't have
a solution, just say, wow, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you tell me that I have got
this problem and I buy a bunch of shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to go solve that problem with your
solution and all it does is backtrack me,
[SPEAKER_00]: guess who I'm never trusting again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess where I'm never going to shop again?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give solid advice, but don't be afraid
to say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, bro, follow basic sales
class techniques, approach, position,
[SPEAKER_00]: engage, follow through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much all you got to do,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the sale happen and it will sell
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be friendly, be a good person,
and the customers will keep coming on
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you again for the great
email.
