[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 461 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Infinity
OG live batter from our friends at Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Underdog OG and I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package describes the flavor as gas,
earth, and bitter skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking the container open now to
give it a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately, I get that gassy,
earthy aroma, followed by a disgustingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: magically delicious, skunky aroma that I
just cannot resist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop smelling this right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could sit here and smell this jar for
the entire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's close this back up, flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says that
this product contains 67.2% THC and zero
[SPEAKER_00]: total CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious and amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: Infinity OG live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously loving the effects of this
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read some
listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to our faithful friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to my friend Tommy.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that we were going to read some
emails on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the email portion of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has a cannabis
cultivation or a cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: question, or if you've got something you'd
like to tell me, maybe you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: correction you'd like to make about
something I've said in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let me know if you want me to say
your name or not in that email.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people look forward to hearing
their name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people really do not want their
name said on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you send me an email,
simply put, hey, Ross DeGeoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: my name is Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love it if you say my name on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you start off with, hey,
Ross DeGeoff, my name is Bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do not say my name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to carefully keep you
anonymous and not say your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really want to hear their
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I apologize if I did not say your name
when I have read your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the first email
of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ross DeGeoff, you're not just growing
killer plants to help medicate the masses
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado, but you're also growing the
knowledge and ability of people worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow medicine to the best of their
abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy notices that I'm traveling up and
down I-25 here in Colorado, teaching all
[SPEAKER_00]: those commercial facilities how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing for the masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, I am spreading free
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of my purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm a father first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff matters more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after that, I'm supposed to be
teaching the world how to grow the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis they can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of my life purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for acknowledging that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, and for that,
sir, no single email can thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right, because I get a lot of
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get multiple emails every day thanking
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those messages coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like fuel for the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just keep me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do I get to see gardens thriving,
I get to see patients and recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers happy and satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see business owners happy and
satisfied because I was able to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: overall productivity of their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I get messages like this every
day from people saying, dude, you helped
[SPEAKER_00]: me grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made my garden better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep fueling my fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep my passion fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep moving on this email
because I'm obviously fucking rambly
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've emailed you in the past and
your advice has saved my backside from
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that would have inevitably ruined
many grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, hopefully I can continue to
provide quality information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I just finished up my
first run of lemon Jeffrey and my lady and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have fallen in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you chose an iry genetic
strain to grow, especially the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey that is named after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that your lady and yourself
enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I have three step kids who have
fallen prey to prohibition lands,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-cannabis rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my current setup is a three foot wide
by three and a half foot tall by one and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half foot deep cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outfitted with led lights, which is
perfect for us, but does not produce huge
[SPEAKER_00]: yields due to the size constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is a fairly limited space you've
got there, but you should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce some quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you grew some lemon Jeffrey
that's got you and your lady happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what else we've got to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to top and trellis my lemon
Jeffrey to fill out most of the net and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it small enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, we had to pull her a little bit
early because of timing issues with the
[SPEAKER_00]: kids, but I was so surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the quality and yield, even with an
early harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to cut it down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to speculate on what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say it was problems with the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what went on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything is cool now,
but even though you had an interruption,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to end the grow a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were still more than satisfied with
the yield and the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad you had a successful grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says high energy and clear headed high
with taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quite often describe the lemon Jeffrey
as smelling like if you got a box of lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: heads and dumped the candy out of the box
and smelled the inside of the box,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has that soft candied lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also quite often describe it as country
time lemonade powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells very much like lemonade powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not heard anybody describe the
lemon Jeffrey as the fresh tennis ball
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut it down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that is something that happens
earlier in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that tennis ball smell goes away by
the time I'm cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had the tennis ball aroma in many
other crosses and strains that I've grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never experienced that in the
lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep going with this email
because it does keep going and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of great stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty ass lemon heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says we hope that someday the stigma of
the anti-cannabis folks will fizzle out so
[SPEAKER_00]: we can enjoy our passion for this plant
without the worry of Johnny Law breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down our door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is the hope, the dream and the
goal of cannabis growers and consumers and
[SPEAKER_00]: activists nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not worldwide, we do want to be able to
grow and possess and consume our medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: safely without the fear of Johnny Law
kicking in the door, shooting the dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying your shit, taking you to jail,
disrupting your life, making you look like
[SPEAKER_00]: an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is what we all want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, but until then,
we will continue to grow from our hearts
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I hope you continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you continue to stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were there in prohibition land,
please keep yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first priority is those kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure those kids are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the kids have everything we need
and then let's grow some killer cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my mom got her hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: To smoke that fat dab and hug white Mike
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, cracker Mike, you hear that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a dab and give you a random
hug, it is because our friend here from
[SPEAKER_00]: this email requested that I give you a
hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get weird on me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike will get a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, I will take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I just took a fat enough dab a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say that that one was for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signs the email with his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys out there wonder if this is
Matty E and he is in prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're thinking about fucking with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Matty E is a fictional character.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a snitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message by saying,
PS, if you read this on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can call me Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some permission and
confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matty E says, and I love all of the white
Mike podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a chill dude who I would love to
smoke with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus his insight on pro cannabis politics
gives me a different conversation point
[SPEAKER_00]: that I hadn't thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vote is for more white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go, cracker Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got more votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's voting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's time for you to come be on
the show again, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen you for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for growing the lemon, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see some pictures of your
next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you growing next time?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you setting up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you join me on Cannabuzz
and post some photos over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you were in prohibition
land, so you do need to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either email me some photos of the next
grow or post them up on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Matty E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck to you, your lady and the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the next grow is completely
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another email in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving right through this giant
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my name, Casey Benny,
if you decide to read this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Casey Benny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm a faithful listener and I met
you at the Dude Grows Cup back in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we had a good time at the Dude
Grows Cup in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've made some BHO and I've ended
up with clear shatter, snap and pull and
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for a quick second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this guy, this person made some BHO
and they ended up with clear shatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is usually the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is basically when you've got to
concentrate, it kind of looks like a thin
[SPEAKER_00]: layer of maybe like a thin layer of Jolly
Rancher, kind of an amber color,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a light yellow color, maybe a golden
Jolly Rancher sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually a real nice thin layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it shatter because when you try to
get some off of the sheet, the little
[SPEAKER_00]: piece, it breaks like candy or like glass,
kind of like breaks like a Jolly Rancher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shatters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why it gets the name shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next one he listed is snap and
pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snap and pull is a lot like shatter,
but it is softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take shatter and you heat it with
your hands, if you just put a little piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of shatter, it would have to be in
parchment paper because it will stick
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fold a piece of parchment paper,
put some shatter in there, hold it between
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body heat will melt the shatter
enough to where it comes to a consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: known as snap and pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just snap and pull a quick little
dab off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to set the dabber on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough to get the dabber into the
concentrate and then just pull a little
[SPEAKER_00]: dab right off real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pull it off there real quick and
it'll come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one dab will come off really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it snap and pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a thicker, laffy taffy sort
of a texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the shatter but melted down a
little bit to be softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more pliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit easier to work with
depending on your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people prefer the shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people prefer the snap and pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is another consistency that
this listener has spoken of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they made sugar wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is just another consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same product, just a different
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out looking a little bit like a
big chunk of ear wax and I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also looks like maybe just a little
chunk of melted crayon or sometimes it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be battery and it can look like a thick
piece of butter or possibly a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: cheesecake batter or possibly even maybe
in some cases cake batter or cookie dough
[SPEAKER_00]: looking sort of texture and appearances
and consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he says sugar wax, I'm thinking it is
probably sort of like a snap and peel but
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say the word mushy because
that doesn't give a good opinion but like
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a puddle of like waxy,
maybe applesauce might be the consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light applesauce would be a nice sugar wax
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a good description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that this
person has made by making BHO on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very similar products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you make them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about making concentrates on
my podcast because I am not a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give a proper advice on how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, I don't know how to
do it completely safely without putting
[SPEAKER_00]: you, your neighbors or your family or your
house or your building at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to teach you how to make
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has already done it so I'm not
going to put him in any risk this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell him not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already got a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's done is with these three
different products, these are mainly just
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens from very little manipulation
of the product or the starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shatter will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not disturb, if you run the
material and do not disturb the final
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome, that concentrate that's in the
container, it most likely will come out as
[SPEAKER_00]: a shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains will not shatter up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will always come out kind of
snap and pulley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can take the shatter and heat it
or before it solidifies and you can whip
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different techniques to
whipping and that will turn it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: batter or a sugar or a different
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depends on the starting product,
how it is whipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say starting product,
there are a lot of contributing factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How moist or dry is your starting product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have many things like how large
are the trichome heads of the starting
[SPEAKER_00]: product?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are the stocks of the starting
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many things like that will make a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everything else in that plant will
make a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the percentage of terpenoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the percentage of lipids?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the percentage of esters and
palliates?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff is going to make a
difference on the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very large contributing factor is,
was anything applied to the plant in any
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle of its life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a pesticide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there an essential oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else sprayed onto this
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is going to come through in
your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every detail will have something to do
with the result of your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every detail in the grow and the handling
and in the processing of the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: will have something to do with the quality
and the texture and consistency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person has ended up with shatter,
which is pretty much standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come up with snap and pull,
which is really easy to do once you catch
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have made sugar wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's keep going with their email and
get to the actual question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm so rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy it for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is, how do I know
that I am purging enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a vacuum chamber, which is a small
stainless steel pot with a lucite lid and
[SPEAKER_00]: a gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the product in there on a heating
pad set at high to about 110 degrees under
[SPEAKER_00]: a full vacuum, either until it turns to
wax or there are absolutely no bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I getting it right or am I giving
myself cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: The product is always tasty and usually
blows my head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the podcast and the beans
and all of the knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sincerely, from KC Benny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, first off, you are very welcome for
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome for the beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome for the knowledge and
also for the entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing and acknowledging
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, that keeps my fire
burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit about your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are concerned that the concentrates
you are making at home, are they purged
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently, sufficiently, properly and
enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you giving yourself cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking butane is what you want to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that I've already said a
few times, I am not a concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this done several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched Kevin do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a brief point in time, our buddy
Spence was trying to teach me how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather be in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather be breeding seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather be recording podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I leave the concentrates up to my
expert friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that being said, let's talk a little
bit about what I do know about purging a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you have got the right
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are putting it on heat and you are
putting it in a vacuum chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat is going to allow the concentrate
to stay viscous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vacuum is going to pull the air out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the air comes out, supposedly it is
sucking the residual butane out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were doing everything correctly and
giving it enough time to properly purge,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be removing most of the butane
and enough of the butane that would make
[SPEAKER_00]: the product dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you flipping the slab at any point in
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's in that chamber vacuum purging,
do you ever release the pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: take the lid off, turn the slab over so
that the bottom is now the top and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of repurge it the other direction
just in case any bubbles got trapped in
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you letting the slab sit in
the chamber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people I know that are making
concentrates have upgraded to an across
[SPEAKER_00]: international vacuum chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually watch the concentrate
bubble up a little bit on the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can create a vacuum inside of that
vacuum chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got heat and you've got a vacuum
and you can make the little muffin in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then you can release the
pressure and watch the muffin collapse and
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you know that you are getting all
of the residual hydrocarbons out of each
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble in that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand that you are limited by
your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those vacuum ovens are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a new concentrate maker,
if you are a home grower, maybe that is
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your reach at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to think about working with
what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure to purge that
concentrate longer than you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going 12 hours and you feel like
it is good enough, go 24 hours and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can over purge your
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you're going to have to be
careful of at that point is volatizing
[SPEAKER_00]: your turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get too hot, you could roast off
the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're setting your heat mat to
110 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I am not a concentrate maker or an
expert, but from my memory, from most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my reading, I do recall that either
cannabinoids or terpenes begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: volatilize around 106 degrees is where we
really start losing important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were first learning to make BHO
concentrates and we did not have all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the science, all of the technology,
all of the equipment, and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, all of the research,
one of the key phrases that many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: makers would say was slow and low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted that slow and low purge,
that low temperature, really slow purge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what everybody's goal was back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think you are purging your
product correctly and properly and enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would let it go just a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, without a lab test, you're not going
to be able to tell how much butane is left
[SPEAKER_00]: in your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it by looking at bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see bubbles in your shatter,
how do you know that that is butane?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people say this has butane in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know those bubbles aren't
oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen makes bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the concentrate was folded,
when the concentrate was moved,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could have made an oxygen bubble in
there just as easily as a butane bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no way to identify a butane
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the concentrate is purged
properly, you will receive more butane
[SPEAKER_00]: from flicking a lighter to smoke a bowl
than you would receive from smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: properly purged BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are putting your dab on the
dab nail, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sparkling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cracking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn your throat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn your lungs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn your mouth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it leave a funky residue on the rig?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a lab test, those are the things
we're going to have to rely on to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if there are any residual
hydrocarbons remaining in our hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: finished concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't have a lot of good ways to
test this, but perhaps you could set a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of your concentrate on something
that is flame resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got like a metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on a pan and then maybe take your
torch and put your torch to that
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it catch on fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn or does it just melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it just melts, you've probably got a
nice clean concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it sparkles, if it pops, if it does
anything that gets your attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably something in there you do
not want to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without a lab, that is the only way we
are going to be able to test our
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if there was enough butane left in
that product, the flame that you put to it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a test would let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat that comes off your dab nail,
when you drop that dab into the nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be some sort of an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your throat, your mouth, your lungs would
let you know if there was too much butane
[SPEAKER_00]: left in that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one good thing about butane is it
does dissipate very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane is not a gas that wants to hang
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane is really light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane is really thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got your concentrate sitting
out in a fairly warm environment and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have it in a thick layer,
it will auto purge itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, when concentrate making was
new, it wouldn't be too uncommon to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: past somebody's car and see just a little
Tupperware dish with a piece of parchment
[SPEAKER_00]: paper folded up inside of the Tupperware
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Tupperware dish either sitting on
the passenger seat or just chilling on the
[SPEAKER_00]: dash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys like myself knew what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using the heat of the car and the
sun to auto purge their concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not making ridiculously large
batches, if you're not running,
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously large amounts of butane,
you can use the sun and a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment paper to auto purge your
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you are a smart enough
person to be able to tell if something is
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that it rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did it say?
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows my head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you've got a quality
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the right color, if it's the right
consistency, and it doesn't make you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: bad, if it doesn't taste bad, if it
doesn't burn, if it doesn't leave a funky
[SPEAKER_00]: residue or anything on the nail,
if you put some of it on a metal surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and light it on fire and nothing bad
happens, I'm going to assume you have got
[SPEAKER_00]: a mostly safe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I cannot see the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just some guy with a podcast who is
hoping you have done everything correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: and having faith in your skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to know, take it to a
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can test it for residual particles
per million of hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell you exactly what is left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, we've just got to do a few
simple at-home tests, which honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how reliable they are,
but they may make you feel a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it on some fire, check on your body,
check on yourself, check on your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything seems okay, then all we can
do is hope everything is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if there was enough butane in
there to cause a problem to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would catch on fire, it would spark,
and there would absolutely be some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, after that long BHO conversation,
I do have to give a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be fucking careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put yourself at great risk when making
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were using a very volatile gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also could cause you some legal
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful working with
hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful making concentrates,
and please don't blow yourself or anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a disclaimer I have to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grow From Your Heart podcast does not
encourage, promote, condone, or support
[SPEAKER_00]: any illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're an adult, so do what the fuck
you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag America.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to give a big shout out
to my buddy Casey Benney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some pictures of your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see what you're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you said you got some seeds from me
at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see photos of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just may share your photos on Instagram
or Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Casey Benney, thank you for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe out there, and of course,
take a fat dab of that concentrate you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making, and you know the rest,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, we are 25
minutes into this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to wrap up this episode
of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you've got a question,
if you've got a cannabis concern,
