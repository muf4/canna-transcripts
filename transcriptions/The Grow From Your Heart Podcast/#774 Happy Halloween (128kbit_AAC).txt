[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of the blueberry butcher
seeds but there are not a lot of the Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: B grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise B grade seeds are great seeds
however they are not as aesthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasing as some of the other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as round.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as perfectly shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as tiger striped but they do a
germination test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not as pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them B grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell them for a lower price in bulk
bundles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are available on iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: While supplies last go check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also while supplies last if you do buy a
pack of blueberry butcher everybody will
[SPEAKER_00]: get a free 10 pack of platinum tangy cross

[SPEAKER_00]: bonus gifts and that is also included or
in addition to your free pack of platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy to Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my advertising for the
iredirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also new merch coming in the merch
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some long sleeve t-shirts made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some hoodies made and I also got
women's tank tops made that I think look
[SPEAKER_00]: really good will look really good on the
ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the merch link and grab the tank
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be posted by the time this
episode does come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newsletter is the easiest way to stay
updated for all of those merchandise and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed drop updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: To join the newsletter go to my website
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see on the bottom there's a part
where it says join the newsletter stay up
[SPEAKER_00]: to date type in your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will add you to the newsletter that way
that way when I send out the newsletter
[SPEAKER_00]: you will get an update about new drops new
strains new merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will stay up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way Patreon gets all of those
updates first and they also get coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get notified of new seed drops very
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also get notified of the new
merchandise drops very first and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: also get coupon codes for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that the Arise seeds are
possibly already sold out on the website
[SPEAKER_00]: is because the patrons got first crack at
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let me find where I am in the
notes and keep going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently it is Halloween season this
episode I'm going to talk about a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of scary things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Halloween season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I got to go to Elitch Gardens in
Denver and enjoy their wicked witch or
[SPEAKER_00]: their witch haunting something scary witch
freaky witches night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The witches walk or something like that at
Elitch's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the Halloween thing that they do
it was pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time I got to take Miss Irie
or Dread Vibes or Zara as I know her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to take her to Elitch's and go to the
haunted houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good time guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you get blazed and go to a
haunted house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some dabs and go get scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really funny feeling a fun
feeling an exciting feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really used to getting blazed and
doing the normal day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to get blazed and see music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to get too lit up and go see
comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting super dabbed out and going through
a haunted house was quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun adrenaline fun giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that like running giggle kind of
scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a person with the chainsaw
behind me but you know they're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill you but something in your mind you
think they might kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the haunted house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also thanks for not killing us to the
killer clown with the chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was getting at is this thought made
me think of some funny things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the scariest things I've
ever seen in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some pretty scary shit in grow
rooms before so I wanted to just really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly here go over some of the scary
shit that I have seen in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one scariest thing I have ever
seen and have seen in multiple rooms is
[SPEAKER_00]: just basically overloading electrical
sockets and electrical currents and
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are not supposed to plug in two
thousand watt lights into one receptacle
[SPEAKER_00]: unless it's been upgraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's a normal house receptacle you're
going to melt some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to burn some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will either be the receptacle the
wiring the breaker something in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breaker box or you may have just a full
blown fire which does lead me to talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about shit I've seen in breaker boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people put clips on the breaker
so the breaker won't flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breaker flips so that nothing else
goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your fail safe so you don't get a
fire and I've seen people just put a clip
[SPEAKER_00]: on it so that it stays in place or put a
screw behind it so it will not move.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is scary to me bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen exposed fans and blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut the shit out of my finger on an
exposed blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get 13 stitches in a finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fingers aren't that big for 13
stitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to get a lot of stitches because of an
exposed blower but exposed fans exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers things that are moving moving
parts that are always exposed scare the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that have always scared the
shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've walked into grow rooms and I've seen
I called it the spider mite teepee center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked into a commercial grow which I
was paid to go help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I walked in there I flip in
the lights I walk in and I look and the
[SPEAKER_00]: top colas look like they've got circus
tents of spider mites just hanging off of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was truly scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something inside of that made me want to
run and throw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was overwhelmed by the amount of bugs
that I had seen in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that freaks me out is when
I see too much water and electricity next
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people like reaching into reservoirs
to get pumps and things and sometimes that
[SPEAKER_00]: scares the shit out of me just basically
freaks me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why then something that
really scares me are automatic trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: machines and wood chippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That trim machine that's got like it just
looks like a barrel with holes in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's got a blade a fan blade that
spins and you just set the buds on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people fuck themselves up with
that thing so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the trim reaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it trim as many fingers and
dreadlocks and elbows as I have weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is fucking scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a co-worker we won't say his name
shout out bro if you listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to run all of the old sticks and
all the leftover through a wood chipper
[SPEAKER_00]: and this dude would stick his fucking hand
in the wood chipper and unclog it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was some of the scariest shit that I
would ever see in a grow environment
[SPEAKER_00]: watching that dude stick his hand in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes walking through with the MED
could be quite scary or the health
[SPEAKER_00]: department or the fire department doing
inspections could be scary but honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: the scariest thing I've ever encountered
in a commercial or personal grow was I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in a really large commercial grow facility
and the power went out and I'm not afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dark but something about being in
that giant cultivation facility and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't remember when the power went out I
went which room am I in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I in room A or B or C and where's the
fucking door?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get out of here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a little while for me to figure
out my way out of that room without
[SPEAKER_00]: running into tables, tripping over lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really did freak me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some of the scariest shit that
I've seen in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to ramble for a minute about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that since the Halloween season
is coming up everybody's in spooky mode I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for me to segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to my friends
at the DGC the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently on their podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been asking when will it come
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well guess what bro that episode is now
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that episode we talk a little bit about
they have a debate they call it hermseed
[SPEAKER_00]: or bagseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion it is bagseed because we
don't know if that seed derived from an
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plant or if that seed arrived or
derived from pollen or stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what caused that seed so we
call that a bagseed in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go very in-depth in that on the Dude
Grow Show real briefly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna tell you something that I really
agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have bagseeds people say what
should I do with these bagseeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice is grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always grow those bagseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you've got until you
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bagseeds are like a major gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lottery ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just grown some trash or
you could have grown the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the winners that have
come from bagseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you realize that Gorilla Glue number
four was technically bagseed?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an accidental pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't meant to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds were taken out of the bag of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is bagseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys Golden Goat was accidental
pollination and is technically bagseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's blow everybody's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the ChemDog crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before Chem4, Chem91,
ChemD, ChemSys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all bagseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know the story of ChemDog and
the legend of the 13 beans I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you do some cannabis research
and learn about ChemDog and the legend of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dude named Chem acquired some herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a longer story to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that herb there were some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name wasn't ChemDog yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had another name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna say your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our friend had a different name and
then he acquired these seeds from some
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that they called, some people called
it the ChemWeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people called it the DogBud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got called ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that later became ChemDog got some
of that weed from some guys at a Grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead show in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked it so much he made connects with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on allegedly they shipped him some
of the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that weed there were 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the ChemDog line all came
from, the Chem91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously popped in 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: ChemD, there was probably A, B,
C, and D, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Chem's sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were different phenotypes of the
chem that came from different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were bagseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that chem stuff is in almost
everything we breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow, smoke, and enjoy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem are cushions in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice to you, the quick version
which is already the long version,
[SPEAKER_00]: is grow those bagseeds but be careful
because you don't know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have gold or do you have absolute
trash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention as you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have, watch out for intersex,
watch out for mutations, but also watch
[SPEAKER_00]: out for the fucking winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let me move on from talking about
the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch that episode to see my full
rant on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, once again, thanks to my
friends at the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Scotty, big up to the Dude,
and of course shout out to my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham Bowe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's move forward and talk about
some other things on my mind lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of new commercial grows
coming on the market and other states and
[SPEAKER_00]: other locations and with that means a lot
of people are acquiring clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'm seeing is that people are
very skeptical on bringing in clones into
[SPEAKER_00]: their new commercial facility because they
are afraid that they are going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: clones with problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know how to buy clones that
are problem free.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know that these clones I'm
getting don't have any issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one quick way to do it is to get a
magnifying glass and give it an
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection, give it a check, but you're
not going to see all of the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to see
everything, especially some of the viruses
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you cannot see hoplite and viroid with
a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do some lab testing for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the quick rundown that I
would do is I would get the clones on a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pull a few random out and give them
a visual inspection with the magnifying
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I see any spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I see any thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I see any fungus gnats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I see any white flies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I see any powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a basic look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a basic oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is the people that sold you
these clones know you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've dunked them and treated them
right before they brought them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing visually detectable on
these clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to think, good,
they look clean, but that is where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, my experience, my advice is
to treat every incoming plant as if it has
[SPEAKER_00]: got every single problem imaginable on
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility as the farmer to
make sure that the incoming plants in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow do not contaminate the existing
plants in your current grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they come in, it is up to you to
treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to give you too much advice
on what to do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what is legal or ethical in
your area, your market, your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're allowed to use
with your department of health and
[SPEAKER_00]: department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what level of toxicity you
are comfortable using, but I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: treating every plant that comes into that
facility with some sort of regimen,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of quarantine and some sort of
pesticide and fungicide regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be aggressive about it when they come
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first thing I would do is when I
get one of those clones, what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: really like is a hop, latent viroid test
with those clones before I purchase them
[SPEAKER_00]: from a reliable clone vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial industry,
the person that is selling them to you has
[SPEAKER_00]: a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the money to pay for a clone
hop, latent viroid test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll split the cost of the
testing with you since you're going to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that expensive and it is worth
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get your hop, latent viroid test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you do get hop, latent viroid from
that clone in the future or from that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant suspected, then you know that you
got it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you didn't get it tested,
you know that it came from that grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got somebody to
communicate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let them know, hey bro,
you've got hop, latent viroid in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to do something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let everybody down the line
know where those clones went.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like getting a bad STD test,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at these clones,
it's just like looking at a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: partner and saying, no, you look clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do an STD test or a clone
cleanliness test completely visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100% reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I would do,
ask for that hop, latent viroid test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get that test?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got that, you're golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that test and you come back
later with viroid, you've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions to ask the lab, the seller,
and yourself, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they don't have that, then you've
got to move forward with your own
[SPEAKER_00]: discretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you trust this seller?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they reliable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they been around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm talking about reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that really concerns me when I
buy clones is do you know what you are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really going to get Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really going to get Gelato?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get just a bunch of
random plants that this guy has that wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell them to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important things is
develop a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build trust with somebody which you were
buying clones from.
[SPEAKER_00]: These clones are going to supply your
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are your money, your investment,
your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some love, some care, some work,
and some detail into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop a relationship with the clone
seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just money, clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn what kind of clones they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about their business ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have any of your other business partners
done business with them, and how did those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they been around long enough to have
a good or bad reputation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if they're brand new, maybe you're
really helping them get started,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the future, you'll have a strong
relationship with one of the first clone
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get myself back on track and keep
me on the point, when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: these clones originally, when you're
negotiating the price and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and the strains, ask for that hop
late and viroid test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can give you that, you're golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then even when you do get those clones,
look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them that visual assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they probably washed them off
right before they tried to sell them to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right before they tried to sell them
to you, they probably cleaned them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like if you're going to sell a guitar
or a car, you go give it an oil change and
[SPEAKER_00]: run it through the car wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before the buyer comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it looks brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks super clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sells a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do that to your clones as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to give them a visual
inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you take them to your facility main
area, to your main grow, have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a quarantine intake procedure and place in
place already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they going to get treated?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long will they be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to give them light?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to give them dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how will you give them water while
they're in that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you provide the proper environment
for these plants in a quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us have a big crazy grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think about a small quarantine
cell for incoming plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However much space you may need for
however many plants you're getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may want to quarantine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get them, inspect them, quarantine
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now begin your treatment regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time these clones won't make
it to the general population for at least
[SPEAKER_00]: a week, maybe seven, 10, maybe 14 days
before they get into the big room with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute they come into my facility,
the front door they go to that quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: room and then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hand spraying them with a hand pump
sprayer with the best pesticides that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can legally and ethically apply to those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will repeat as necessary based on
the products that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably every three, maybe every four
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat that for 15 days ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get five sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go into general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you treat your incoming
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to cover them in predator
bugs, that is a good way to do it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the predators right on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a future episode, we're going to talk
about releasing predator and selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: predator bugs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Lemur for the great
inspiration on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can use predator bugs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you have a lot of them
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to have to build
themselves up to fight the army that you
[SPEAKER_00]: already brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them there prepared, hungry,
ready to attack any predators that do show
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is to remember that
when you are buying clones, it is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility to make sure that those
clones are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every seller is going to say my clones are
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may know that they've got bugs or
they may not know that they've got bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may know they've got a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may know there's a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to try to tell you my
clones are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've learned is that the person
that brags the most about the cleanest
[SPEAKER_00]: facility probably has the worst bug
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have not found it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets a bug problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be embarrassed if you get bugs,
spider mites, thrips, whatever that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to adjust, adapt, and overcome those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be a true farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my time, see how long I've
been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably only about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one more quick question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, through the power of editing,
I did get that organized pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a message here that came from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from our friend All
Mixed Up and it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a used grow tent for free with the
lights and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is I know there was powdery
mildew and spider mites all over that tent
[SPEAKER_00]: and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a free gift, but it came with
free problems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is it all worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on your needs and your
requirements and your budget, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, bro, use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it says, should I spray it all
down with bleach water and hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same goes with the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put it in my storage unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not bring it home yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of affordable grow equipment
available on Craigslist, available on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook Marketplace, especially at the
pawn shops and the thrift stores around
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are selling grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: People buy grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're going to be the next
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They realize it's a lot of work and they
sell all their shit for super cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is, yes,
it does come with problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's spider mites and powdery mildew
and who knows what else in that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's good stuff, you can clean it
and you can use most of those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely recommend replacing all
of the light bulbs if you've got screw-in
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's LEDs, keep rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got like high pressure
sodiums or metal halides, definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrew those bulbs, put in a new bulb
because you never have any idea how long
[SPEAKER_00]: that bulb has been in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a freshie in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also would not recommend, and you didn't
say you're going to do this, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend using bottled
nutrients that you bought from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what could have happened,
how long they've been sitting there,
[SPEAKER_00]: what could have got splashed into it,
if it could have dried up, if some could
[SPEAKER_00]: have evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has it been there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it expired, chelated and buffered or
chelated and buffered nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all my Canadian friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffered nutrients will bind together over
time if they are sitting there too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have an expiration date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not use those recycled and gifted
and leftover bottled nutrients or the
[SPEAKER_00]: powders even for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the equipment and stuff I
think you could probably use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sanitize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you put it in your storage shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put something in a storage shed in
Colorado this summer, any bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew, most of that shit probably
got cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got microwaved, barbecued by the
natural heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably 150 or 170 degrees in a
storage shed this summer if you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any sort of airflow, air conditioning
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Arizona or something like
that, your shit got roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that helped you out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about to get winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get negative 17s and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got it in the garage or a
storage shed, that may help you kill some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it may help some of them go dormant
and stay longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But extreme temperatures may help you get
rid of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would shine it with, I would spray it
with either bleach or hydrogen peroxide or
[SPEAKER_00]: Fizan 20, something really good like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in every nook, every cranny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got blowers and fans,
I'd get a spray bottle and spray inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: there so you can get everything,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want all of it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's all completely clean,
I'd actually use an air compressor also to
[SPEAKER_00]: get inside and clean out some of the nooks
and crannies of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use an air compressor, a couple of
Swifters, a bunch of scrubbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that shit super clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy a bunch of products, a whole bunch of
cleaning products and you'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clean it up, then set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got it set up, clean it all
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find spots that didn't get
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the inside and the outside,
all of the equipment, everything all over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then plug it in, then run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get real hot with that light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light will speed up any cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are a bug or eggs, anything in
there that wants to process its life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, turning on that light, letting it
run, that will encourage that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no plants that there at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing for them to attach to
and eat and enjoy so they won't hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just go, they'll birth and they'll
go, fuck, I need plants to live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll go look for some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants to live on, some food to eat
and some other spider mites to breed and
[SPEAKER_00]: mate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they don't find their way to
your other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've cleaned it up enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat your other plants, be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now set it up, run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an integrated pest management
strategy in place and start doing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: minute you set it up and especially the
moment you start putting plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think you'll be able to clean it up
enough because I've worked in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities where we've purchased old
warehouses and gutted them and turned
[SPEAKER_00]: those into cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we didn't get rid of all of the old
drywall, the old electrical wires,
[SPEAKER_00]: the old conduit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get rid of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building, the facade of the building
still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just changed everything inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were still opportunities for spider
mites, fungus gnats, thrips, whiteflies,
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that shit could still get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you clean real well, the next step is
taking care of the plants, the integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manage your airflow, manage your intake,
your outtake, your vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then treat the plants with a routine pest
management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's sprays or if it's live bugs,
predator bugs, whatever you want to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, however you want to do it,
treat that way, but make sure you stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over time you'll be confident that
you've destroyed all the bugs that did
[SPEAKER_00]: come with that tent if any of them did
survive your cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that you can use it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use anything that is
electrical, I highly recommend that you
[SPEAKER_00]: inspect all of the electrical components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights, the blowers, air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a good inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure nothing got burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing got no char marks or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything's tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple times you plug it in and
watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure nothing sparks, arcs,
burns, squeals, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep a good eye on it because it's
used gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do know why they got rid of it,
but other people listening may have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: gear and they don't know why that person
gave it to them or they got rid of it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the thrift store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't burn down your house
with used equipment that came from some
[SPEAKER_00]: other person's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let me check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I got it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replace the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I covered the notes for this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude 311, I hope your new grow tent is
cleaned and set up and rocking.
