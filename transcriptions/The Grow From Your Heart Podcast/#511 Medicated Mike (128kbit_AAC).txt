[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the last time we ever saw
Larry the Midget.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, let's start a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is time for episode 511 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: White Mike is across the table from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just gave him a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got him coffin.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has changed about four different
colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's almost back to his normal color.
[SPEAKER_04]: The drool has slowed down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for taking time out of your busy
dad schedule and the moving life to come
[SPEAKER_04]: join me on a show.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been fun lately, but feels good
to get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hell yeah, it's time to do a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I texted you, I asked if you could
get your day pass and come spend some time
[SPEAKER_04]: over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the pass was granted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad you're able to get free for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just dumb luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: But fate aligned tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We needed to record.
[SPEAKER_04]: His voice will catch up soon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he got dab throat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said fate aligned and he did just take
a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a fate punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he'll be all right momentarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will speak while Mike gets his life
together over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, I'm glad you're here today to ask
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had that same question a couple of
episodes ago when I was listening to the
[SPEAKER_05]: car.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I'm here today to ask it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That question is GFYH10, the numerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, GFYH, growth from your heart and
then 10 for 10% off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where do you get that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_05]: ctiernow.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, ctiernow.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to all my friends at
ctiernow.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only do they help me out, but we are
also friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We start the show off generally by talking
about what we are smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're wondering why the show started a
little screwby, it's because of... I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: just fine, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're the one that is... Did you
say screwby?
[SPEAKER_04]: Screwby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the word you went with?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that even mean, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people know, some people don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: This situation here, this is screwby.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Screwby dooby doo, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're smoking the fuzzy navel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez, what'd you do to my face?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm all screwby.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're smoking fuzzy navel live batter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's harder to say than it sounds,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuzzy navel live batter from Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a blend of jelly 13 and peach Oz
on the package.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flavor is described as orange push pop
and peach daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going to say it's pretty
close to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The name is fuzzy navel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted the carbonation and some fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you have a peach or some fuzzy
fruit, you can taste that fuzz on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the daiquiri and the orange push
pop, but it was more like an orange soda
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love your discerning description.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can even taste the pulp a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the part I'm calling that fuzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mimosa is the word I'm looking for in my
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Problem solved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Less champagne, more orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think very mimosa-y is the word that my
brain, my Rolodexa flavors was trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mimosa-y is what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good, I'm sorry I made fun
of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll never do it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never doubt your flavor palette.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like every now and then I nod to
answer questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, bro, you've got something
useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other times I'm just like,
oh, he said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's do some shout outs to a few
of our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without our friends on Patreon,
this show would not be what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start off with the big giant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a big giant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Scott Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a big fist bump to Redbeard?
[SPEAKER_04]: I always want to send a big thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my buddy Grimbold the Druid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's pass a big fat joint over to my
friend Prospect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big giant dab to my buddy
OG Purple Thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always want to send a big thank you to
Kehmatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but certainly not least,
I want to send a big giant Girl From Your
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out and a fist bump to my buddy Noor
Kal-Iri.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to everybody who supports
the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I keep saying this, but if you
would like to support the show,
[SPEAKER_04]: you must visit www.patreon.com forward
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to type in that full URL.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go to Patreon and then rely on
their search bar to find the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will not work.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make it easy for you, for my friends
out there who would like to support,
[SPEAKER_04]: I left a link in the show notes or in the

[SPEAKER_04]: It will take you to my Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, big shout out and thank you to
everybody who has been supporting the show
[SPEAKER_04]: via Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike, that is all of the
business part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the fun part of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love having you on the podcast because
it is a mix of educational, informational,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then rambly, crazy nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful mix of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Educational, entertaining, nonsensical
rambles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag they love it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you got any rambles for us today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you come preloaded with any topics or
do we need to go scour the internet for
[SPEAKER_04]: something to get Mike fired up with?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to shake some stuff
out today.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just the usual rants, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of states gearing up to
fumble a legalization attempt again this
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of stuff on the East Coast is being
talked about, but it looks like New York,
[SPEAKER_05]: New Jersey, Pennsylvania are going to drag
their feet a little bit again on
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization, spend another year exploring
options, figuring out tax rates and
[SPEAKER_05]: license fees and zoning rules and not get
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Letting the perfect get in the way of the
good, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes complete sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you said the analogy was they're
not going to allow the people to eat
[SPEAKER_04]: because the meal is not perfect yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that legalization is huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a massive concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: Changing something that's this big and
this ingrained.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody that's done it yet
has gotten it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: My throat still feels really weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry if I sound off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to fix your microphone,
but we'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clear throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a throat thing, not an
equipment thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of places where the rest of
this year and next year they're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: continue arresting mostly poor,
mostly minority people for simple
[SPEAKER_05]: possession.
[SPEAKER_05]: And distribution and whatnot of cannabis,
all because they can't just make a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: of steps towards legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got to find a way to make sure
that it rights all the wrongs of the drug
[SPEAKER_05]: war and evenly distribute stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's an equitable amount of
minority ownership from the jump.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which are all great points, but- They're
all super lofty goals, but you're never
[SPEAKER_05]: going to solve all of the evils of basic
capitalism just because it's marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization now.
[SPEAKER_05]: All in one move.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're still overcoming all of the same
baggage and headaches and hurdles that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been fighting my whole life,
our whole life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just sitting here thinking that one
of my little rants that I could do tonight
[SPEAKER_05]: was that some of the figureheads from the
last 20 years of the legalization movement
[SPEAKER_05]: need to sit down and shut the fuck up
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to put too fine a point on it,
but it's just some of those figureheads
[SPEAKER_05]: that were so necessary 15, 20 years ago,
just being out front saying, I consume
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis pretty heavily all day,
every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a perfectly rational, normal human.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take care of my shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I handle my business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not hurting nobody.
[SPEAKER_05]: This shouldn't be a crime.
[SPEAKER_05]: The snoop dogs of the world, we needed
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to break through the wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: There had to be an example that we could
point to and be like, Tommy Chong's been
[SPEAKER_05]: chiefing for all day, every day for
forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was going to be a lung cancer
thing, we'd have spotted it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We needed that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point, he's just retweeting
tit shots.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just needs to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it needs to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stop representing the culture is
probably the better way to say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not say that anybody- It needs to go
away, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for the longest time, the only
representatives or the only people that
[SPEAKER_05]: could represent the cannabis culture were
the people that were either bulletproof or
[SPEAKER_05]: had nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Musicians, comedians, the entertainer
types, not anybody attached to any
[SPEAKER_05]: corporations or any- Yeah, nobody that was
going to have a boss screaming at them
[SPEAKER_05]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's partly why I was able to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't have been me 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first came out of college,
I still held all the beliefs that I have
[SPEAKER_05]: today, but I couldn't go to city council
and vocally fight for good zoning rules
[SPEAKER_05]: for legalization back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just because it wasn't happening back
then, but if had I done that, I would have
[SPEAKER_05]: lost my job.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still very true in parts of the
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some ways, we do need figureheads like
that still, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization's never really, or at least
not anytime soon, and I'm talking in the
[SPEAKER_05]: next 30 years, you're going to have a
place where it's 100% legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's going to hassle you even a little
for growing weed in your basement and
[SPEAKER_05]: selling it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not happening in the next 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that it should.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with the person in
your friend group or your circle or your
[SPEAKER_05]: family or whatever that is in love with
and passionate about and talented at
[SPEAKER_05]: growing cannabis to grow cannabis for your
circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we do basically everything
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that are good at building shit
build the shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that are good at making
clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mechanic friends fix up my cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how everything works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, you're going to have to go
through and get licensed and follow rules
[SPEAKER_05]: and have zoning guidelines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have guidelines to follow and proper
testing regimes to follow, packaging
[SPEAKER_05]: labels, all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how any emerging industry evolves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just any industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we invented a cooler new
sneaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like a new fucking hairdo or a new
instrument.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it wasn't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also a medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also part of people's religion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also a major part of people's
cultures around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not just one of those things
active at each time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everybody I know that consumes
cannabis, even tangentially, like people
[SPEAKER_05]: that use hemp based lotions that are made
from hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not even any CBD in that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been on the market for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's multiple things at play and
getting them all addressed is really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be slow and it's going
to be piecemeal and it's going to be two
[SPEAKER_05]: steps forward, one step back or one step
forward, two steps back, depending on
[SPEAKER_05]: where you are and which part of this
you're fighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And watching people continue to make no
progress because they can't find a way to
[SPEAKER_05]: make all the progress it wants is just so
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good way to loop that back around,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really like there was a big article
out today that the mayor in New York is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to go on a sightseeing tour of
legalization states to see what's going on
[SPEAKER_05]: on the ground there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And two of the states are brand spanking
new.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one's California,
which is sort of the biggest stumble block
[SPEAKER_05]: right now in all the legal legislation
states, if you ask me, at least the ones
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been up and running for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so big.
[SPEAKER_05]: California is its own country.
[SPEAKER_05]: So few people can keep that in their head
because it's a state just like we're a
[SPEAKER_05]: state or Maine's a state or Nevada's a
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also like the third largest
economy in the world or some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: California is massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: The number of people, the amount of square
footage, trying to come up with
[SPEAKER_05]: comprehensive rules there for anything is
a bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the legal weed and for the cannabis
industry, there's just so much history
[SPEAKER_05]: there to overcome and to work through and
to work out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take another 20 years before
the legal cannabis industry in California
[SPEAKER_05]: runs like the one in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to basically rebuild out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it has to be completely restarted
and replanned from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a whole other fucking can of
worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying about some places are asking
for too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have talked to, I myself have said on
this show when it comes to writing the
[SPEAKER_04]: rules and regulations and the legislation
about cannabis in your area to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: to include somewhere to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've tried to make sure to include and
cover all of the bases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that was too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we've slowed down some progress
because they're asking for too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you said, Hey dad, can I go to the
party and dad city and go to the party?
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you said, can I wear my tiny
skirt?
[SPEAKER_04]: And now dad's like, fuck the whole party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, no, you can't even go out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, places like New York, they're
trying to find a way that they can make up
[SPEAKER_05]: for 80 years of systemic racism and bad
policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not doable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that you can fix with a
well-crafted law.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that can only be fixed with
80 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: 80 years of working the other way and
watching them come to the table again this
[SPEAKER_05]: year and say cannabis legalization is an
idea whose time has come.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prohibition hasn't worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: The drug war has been a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely decimated, poor minority
communities across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want anything to do with it
anymore, but we're going to keep it going
[SPEAKER_05]: for another year or two while we hammer
out the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just.
[SPEAKER_05]: So painful to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people go to jail every year
because of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then not only do they go to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get arrested and put in the
system, you're in the system now to
[SPEAKER_04]: recognize you as somebody who's a problem
causer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're probably on probation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now if you do something tiny one more
time, you're getting locked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's also on your criminal record,
also on your employment history.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to write that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably got to pay a bunch of fines.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a young person in a big city,
it's probably already hard to get work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can't get work because you've got
a crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you've got to pay fines.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even fucking afford to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't pay those fines.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You end up in more fucking trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it puts people into a shitty
fucking cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the talking points I see a lot from
the anti-cannabis crowd is that there
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't that many people in federal prison
for marijuana possession and they define
[SPEAKER_05]: the stat like that very, very,
very narrowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Federal prison is different than jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being charged with just possession is also
very different than being charged with a
[SPEAKER_05]: base marijuana crime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because depending on where you're
standing, the vape pen that we've got on
[SPEAKER_05]: the table here that is perfectly legal in
a place like Texas is a class one felony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if we've only got a half gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to charge you for the
weight of the pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Including the battery.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now you're looking at what,
a quarter pound of what they basically
[SPEAKER_05]: classify as heroin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four to six ounces worth of battery right
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a lithium ion battery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's not made of helium.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stat is purposefully manipulated to
point out that there are very few people
[SPEAKER_05]: in the harshest prisons or like the most
intense prison systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the federal prison system for the
smallest crime on the books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just possessing a personal use amount of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've also got rules depending on where
you're standing that if you go to your
[SPEAKER_05]: dealer and buy an eighth pot and they give
it to you in three gram baggies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all of a sudden you get pulled over
15 minutes later or stopped and frisked
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's not an eighth you just bought.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's three grams you've got for
distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Separate baggies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember one time I went and picked up a
quarter back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was either right when I started college
or right at the end of high school and I
[SPEAKER_05]: got seven gram bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like as soon as it hit my hand I was
like, well you just got demoted to dealer
[SPEAKER_05]: number three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you just went from slot one to slot
three like that buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like now when I get back to the car I've
got to find something in my car to dump
[SPEAKER_05]: all this into.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all in one container.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like and I mean this was still in the days
where having a scale to check to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: you didn't get cheated was evidence of
distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the courts were concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean we've got to undo all of this and
it's going to take a hell of a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were problems when we had our
medical marijuana cards here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would get pulled over and the cops
would be like you smell like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like yeah I'm not stoned I smell like
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd be like well I'm going to go
through your car and you're like oh I have
[SPEAKER_04]: a medical marijuana card so all my stuff
is legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd still steal your weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd send you home with your pipe and
whatever else you had but they would take
[SPEAKER_04]: your marijuana from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you lose your pipe and shit too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they wouldn't arrest you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't give you a ticket but they
just take all your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was because they simply didn't
agree with the medical marijuana rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or didn't understand a lot of the time
also I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean honestly the way we did this in
Colorado when Colorado and Washington did
[SPEAKER_05]: it in before that during the just medical
days when there were no legal rec states
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people and I mean a lot a lot of
people just kept waiting for the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: government to wake up and go no bad
hippie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it threatened the states with the one
that everybody talked about was road
[SPEAKER_05]: funding because that's how the feds got
all the states to snap in a line with
[SPEAKER_05]: drinking age and alcohol rules was to
threaten federal highway dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean places like California that's
why they're so fucked now is because they
[SPEAKER_05]: passed medical in 96.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so before 96 there was a thriving very
well run well organized black market that
[SPEAKER_05]: spanned the whole state and supplied a
huge portion of the country with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was all operating out of California
Oregon Washington State Golden Triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can look this shit up if you don't
know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the North Cal Humboldt Golden
Triangle area.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pull up the union.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a documentary on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more about B.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like eight years after the time
period I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it'll break down what breaks down for
you what existed before medical if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not familiar or if you're just interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking great watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of forgot about that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then medical hits in 96 and literally
everyone in charge from the cop that just
[SPEAKER_05]: got out of cop school to the governor of
the country or the governor of the state
[SPEAKER_05]: kept waiting for the feds to go knock it
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to yank your highway funding
shut it all down tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the governor never told the
legislature to hurry up and get on
[SPEAKER_05]: crafting rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: The legislature never told law enforcement
to fucking look at what the law passed and
[SPEAKER_05]: learn what the medical rules said so that
they could enforce them correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chiefs of police never told their guys
what the rules were to give a fuck because
[SPEAKER_05]: none of their bosses cared either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was just left up to everybody to
kind of guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: And watching how that played out in
Colorado where we had a pretty solid
[SPEAKER_05]: entrenched black market before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medical hit in 2000 but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing like California.
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't supplying most of the United
States from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did for a minute but mostly just on
paper in the press because that's where
[SPEAKER_05]: they focus their busts.
But.
[SPEAKER_05]: California's problems way way bigger and
it's mostly because it was ignored for
[SPEAKER_05]: longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had solid rules on the books and a
couple of revisions already before
[SPEAKER_05]: California legislatures got around to
really trying to craft anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are completely operational
dispensaries in California that do not
[SPEAKER_04]: have any paperwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have any of the state or county
or city.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pending.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are stores that just pop up.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three out of every four is what
the stat is in California right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three out of every four stores are
entirely illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them are doing the very best
they can to follow what rules there are in
[SPEAKER_05]: their area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their area just hasn't gotten around to
finalizing it so that there isn't do steps
[SPEAKER_05]: one through seven type process to get
licensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other places they've been banned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so dispensary just pops up like
mushrooms after a good rain man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just pops up and then they wait until
they get raided and they take as many
[SPEAKER_04]: sales as they can until it's over and then
they just disappear and then they pop up
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever I get in an argument about U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: social policy as far as cannabis goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to bring up the size and scope of
the black market as often as I possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like Pepsi where we can really
gauge U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: sales accurately.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've got good estimates and the
guesstimates are fucking insanely large.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 35 to 70 billion dollars a year in U
.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much do you think of that as cop math?
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends because these are DEA
estimates.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really the only people that have a
good guesstimate of U.S.
drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know for a fact that their view and
their guesstimates are really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really shitty.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go about doing the math a couple
of different ways and take how many people
[SPEAKER_05]: per hundred thousand or whatever consume
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the math for the whole population of
the USA and then do the math for the
[SPEAKER_05]: average marijuana consumer consumes blank
amount of marijuana per blank amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: time and marijuana costs blank amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Per weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Math with Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works back to about 30 to 50 billion
dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to put that in perspective,
because numbers like that don't mean
[SPEAKER_05]: anything to regular humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the size of the cosmetics industry in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: So think about eyeliner, fingernail
clippers, shampoo, all that shit,
[SPEAKER_05]: lotion, all that shit everywhere you go to
see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see it a while ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walgreens, Walmart, the gas station,
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the trucks it took to deliver it,
all the companies it takes to make it,
[SPEAKER_05]: all the factories it takes to produce it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry has been doing that
until very, very recently in people's
[SPEAKER_05]: basements, in backyards, in national
parks, atics, basements.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got basements in the Midwest.
Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outdoors and the coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And only very recently has any of this
activity been legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I mean, people point at the seven
billion dollars that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry did legally last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, oh, it's going to
balloon to 20 billion by 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, well, the industry as a
whole has already been doing 35 billion or
[SPEAKER_05]: better since the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an insane amount of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a number I can't even fathom
when it comes to money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea that we're going to let all
of this just take place in the dark
[SPEAKER_05]: forever because it feels good when you
smoke it is fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And getting all of that pulled out and
straightened out and lined up like we do
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else is just going to take a
long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we got to get after it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we keep pussyfooting around and fucking
around until it's perfect, it's never
[SPEAKER_05]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see and feel the improvements of
this little dusty town because of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody 24 to 40 works in the marijuana
industry if they choose to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty easy to go get a job as a
trimmer, a cultivator, a budtender,
[SPEAKER_04]: a driver.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the packages have to get moved.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just our circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a lot honestly, it's like 50 to
1,500 or 2,000 people in a town of 130,000
[SPEAKER_05]: and literally just putting 2,000 people
back to work every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 2,000 people buying lunches.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 2,000 people paying rent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 2,000 people buying groceries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also that brings the people that
own the dispensary have to be here
[SPEAKER_04]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they live in an ivory tower,
wherever those people live, they have to
[SPEAKER_04]: come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The owners of The Grow have to come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their consultant buddies have to come
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their investor buddies come here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hotel rooms and tourists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better restaurants here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are better restaurants is what I was
getting at.
[SPEAKER_05]: The food options here have exploded over
the last five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame it on the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot going on in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just the cannabis industry that's
really pushing Colorado forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: The legal cannabis is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the only part of it though.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're a tradesman, if you're an
electrician or a plumber, with a small
[SPEAKER_05]: business or that worked for a small
business, literally in Southern Colorado,
[SPEAKER_05]: legal cannabis saved your business in
2008, 2010, 2012.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without legal cannabis, you don't have a
business anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also all those restaurants that open
because we need lunch breaks, they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: hiring people as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's put so many people back to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of smoke shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bringing an underground business above
board, there's so much money, there's so
[SPEAKER_05]: much potential for investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Colorado was rife with properties that
needed a little bit of love, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pueblo and Trinidad, Walsenburg,
we've been slow death since the late
[SPEAKER_05]: 50s-ish when mining and steel started to
slowly take a downturn down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like somebody's standing on our
throat and we needed something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis brought all three of those
cities back in a big way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trinidad and Walsenburg are booming now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember we used to go there and we
would notice- Trinidad, I think it was-
[SPEAKER_05]: Trinidad would notice when we pulled up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd be like, oh, those two guys are
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would know there's a different
car in town.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how small it used to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it is thriving.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it was Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their chief of police had a great
interview in the paper a couple of years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a nice long article about how he
went from a detractor and a skeptic to an
[SPEAKER_05]: ardent supporter because he had seen what
the legal industry and the taxes had done
[SPEAKER_05]: for his town.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't one of those things where
it's like, I'm willing to trade all the
[SPEAKER_05]: bad stuff for the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's very little bad stuff to be seen
because it's just cannabis and it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're not interested and you're
not consuming, it's- It shouldn't affect
[SPEAKER_05]: bother or even appear on the radar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like the NFL for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear people talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know anything about it and I could
give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same way with cannabis if you're
not into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like golf.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's happening somewhere right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I drive by places where it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I see people doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want any.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, one thing I love is they banned
advertising of cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't really advertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't put a big sign up on the street
like come to my weed store.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that the way around that is to
adopt a highway.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sponsor the highway cleanup
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: That always makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: This highway was cleaned up by Mike and
Jeff's dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the rules in Colorado that I
really like because we learned our lesson
[SPEAKER_05]: with alcohol and tobacco advertising.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason for Joe Campbell to
exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just make that shit a part of the
past.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need weed store cartoons.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can skip all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love some of the commercials though,
the educational commercials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't forget that you can't take your
weed to the state park or the state fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all gentle about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the industry did some of the shit our
regulators pull or the anti-pop people
[SPEAKER_05]: pull, the anti-pop people love putting
edibles on billboards.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the company that makes the edible that
the anti-pop companies used in their
[SPEAKER_05]: photo, put up a billboard that showed the
fucking cookie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the M I M E D would break out the
black helicopters.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a, that's a wonderful point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never saw that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never saw it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a group smart Colorado that does
every year they do a billboard with a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of edibles and now they're edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even get in Colorado anymore
because shit like four, three or four
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago, we banned everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a geometric shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't look appealing anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it looks good, you can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not quite true.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gummies I look, look delicious,
but shout out to make a very beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: product still.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be packaged up toward.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't appeal to children.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you can just use plain words to tell
us what's in the package.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way my two year old doesn't try
to eat it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh, smart Colorado does this
giant billboard and slaps it up on I-25
[SPEAKER_05]: every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always chuckle when I see it because
if any dispensary did it, or if any of the
[SPEAKER_05]: edible companies with products shown did
it, they would immediately be slapped with
[SPEAKER_05]: huge fines.
[SPEAKER_05]: The billboard would be down within a
couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and no, but because it's an anti-pop
group that suckers up for months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it up there, put it right up in the
middle of Denver so you can see it on I-25
[SPEAKER_04]: all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A moment ago, Mike, you said that we had
some of the wrong faces representing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and that you wish some folks
would disappear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly who?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be more of an ideal,
uh, face for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would you, if you were hiring,
if you're like, all right, I run weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: weeds at business and you're the fucking
king and I'll be the king.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be the vice president.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put you as the hiring
manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making me the VP of marketing and
I've got to find us a new promo face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are the faces of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be anybody that we
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fucking swimmer with the snaggletooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make, oh, the, the Olympic guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew his name until you said his fucking
name, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, yeah, the guy with the lungs
that's got all the awards.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's my first call.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. 17 gold medals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phelps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Michael Phelps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever just yelled that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you yelled Michael Phelps into your,
if you yelled Michael Phelps motherfucker
[SPEAKER_04]: into your phone just now, I heard it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard you and I said it out loud because
of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out, big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_04]: I owe you a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so if you tweet me Michael Phelps
right now, not if Michael Phelps tweets me
[SPEAKER_05]: it listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you tweet me just a tweet that says,
Hey, at Nemo pump 50, the answer was
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Phelps.
[SPEAKER_05]: You stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might, I probably won't, but I might
send you a sticker or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow them back at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least a follow back.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Michael Phelps tweets it, either one of
us, I will for sure send you a sticker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll find you an Irish shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's really Michael Phelps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see that blue check mark though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be verified, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, now I'm not trying to be rude about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just, I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely understand that you don't
want the tie dye shirt guy with the
[SPEAKER_04]: pimples who hasn't taken a shower and he's
got the headband and those hippie glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalize weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, that was perfect for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace and love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalize weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of gotten there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's fucking like let out all the
fucking people who committed a little weed
[SPEAKER_04]: crime out of jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at a better point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be better presented.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know who you would sign up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've, we've got a lot of people that,
I mean, a lot of the original figureheads
[SPEAKER_05]: still seem to be fighting for my,
my favorite grower can grow weed in their
[SPEAKER_05]: basement and sell it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's never going to be as legal as we
want it to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in our lifetime, not like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I get all the arguments and I'm
behind it and then I'm with you and it
[SPEAKER_05]: should be, but it's just not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we're not being rational and
reasonable about it, like government is
[SPEAKER_05]: all about compromise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Society is all about compromise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what makes America great is
cause you get to do you and I get to do
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as one of us ain't stomping on
the other, we're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not until we go crashing into each
other, then we got problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we could just chill out and,
and focus on upfront starting the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation with this is going to be a
compromise when we're done and we shake
[SPEAKER_05]: hands and we're finished with this,
everybody's going to have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: a bad taste in their mouth on one point or
another.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's what compromise is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's never, it's all my way and fuck
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how government works.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not, we don't have Kings and
dictators here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just made you King of cannabis Island a
moment ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but like it, Michael Phelps didn't
call me back, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: He like, he's got enough money.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to swim around our Island and
laugh at us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh, I'm, it just drives me nuts
when I see these figureheads that I've,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've loved and I've supported for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, all of a sudden they're anchors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of battering Rams and it's,
it's just unfortunate guys out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you can take from that is be a
fucking battering Ram for the legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: and the movement for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be an anchor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you that you're out there
supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I wrote down a few things that I
thought would be an ideal cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: spokesperson or advocate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, uh, this is very general,
but these are things that I think you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: agree with Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need somebody that's addressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need you in a bathing suit and I
don't need you in your sixties hippie
[SPEAKER_04]: costume, but be yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, present yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we need people to take you
seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't talk too much shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to be this person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing my part right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm inventing our hypothetical favorite
cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there are dreadlocks really kill you.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a beautiful research researcher
with like a million PhDs who's got dreads,
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Carl Hart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time he gives a speech,
like 80% of the responses, baby fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: dreads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, dude, he's been to the best
schools.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got the degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: He really knows he's doing the research.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in the lab offering crack to crack
addicts and being like, here's crack or a
[SPEAKER_05]: five, make a smart choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy's like, I'll take five bucks
and go get a cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's doing the fucking research and
people still won't listen to him just
[SPEAKER_05]: cause he's got dreads.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's who I am and it's what I love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, it works very well for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fighting for your right to wear them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rastafari, big respect, but like high
five, realizing that it's a, I represent,
[SPEAKER_04]: I represent, I read genetics, which having
dreadlocks works beautifully for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I represent the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do that very well with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you're surprised by any of
this conversation right now, I am six foot
[SPEAKER_04]: five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I weigh about 190, maybe 210 pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fluctuate summer, winter time,
192, 10 ish six, five, 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I have got dreadlocks that are thick
and crazy and they go to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are often surprised when
they discover the dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've met me and they were tied up
and you went, how fucking long are those?
[SPEAKER_05]: They go to the knees straight up carrying
like nine Afghans behind his head.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of hair going on here,
but I take care of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, uh, cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very well cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Mike, you made that awkward.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very well kept.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for the most part, I got a lovely
friend who takes good care of my
[SPEAKER_04]: dreadlocks when she's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, she is pregnant at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm supposed to say that
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a baby showers in a few days.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, she takes great care of my dreads when
she's not super pregnant, but right now
[SPEAKER_04]: she is as pregnant as I think a person
should get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, where am I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so people are quite often taken by
surprise by my appearance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I represent the plant and myself
very well, but if we're going to build our
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite cannabis advocate, they'd be
well-dressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not the guy to pick to convince
Republicans to vote for legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not what I'm trying to do,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to, I speak well and I've got
the show then the audience that I'm trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to reach.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a male or a female that is
properly dressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm trying to skip over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You calling me a tool, a person properly
dressed, not a bikini, not a suit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could drop, drop that stick at
the trade shows, that'd be pleasant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we don't need the bikini clad stuff
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's the beer industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can drive across the street to the
titty bar after the trade show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also some hygiene.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people nowadays, I'm a dreadlock
white guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I smell good, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't stink.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't smell my dreads.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't smell my pits.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't smell my feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be presentable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then here is stuff that really,
I think we need somebody that can speak
[SPEAKER_04]: well, somebody that can form and compose a
proper paragraph.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that can go in front of a podium
and talk to, I want somebody that can
[SPEAKER_04]: convince my grandma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you grandma.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's gone now, but somebody that would be
able to convince my grandma that cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: THC and or CBD would be perfect for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason to convince my gramps.
[SPEAKER_04]: He already knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: But somebody that can talk to the old
folks, somebody that can talk to the
[SPEAKER_04]: reggae fans, somebody that can talk to the
juggalos, somebody that can talk to my
[SPEAKER_04]: accountant, somebody that can talk to the
lawyers, somebody that can speak to
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody like they're all equal and they
can all understand your words that you use
[SPEAKER_04]: and the way that you use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's somebody that I would like to see
represent us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd be all for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, like a lot of the people
that have been representing the community
[SPEAKER_05]: for years and decades do a wonderful job
and have done a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see something at least once a day where
I just facepalm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really on the cusp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Politics is nuts right now and it's going
to get kookier, but basically every
[SPEAKER_05]: democratic politician right now is not
just pro-legalization, but they're
[SPEAKER_05]: one-upping each other with, I'm going to
legalize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm going to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to legalize it on day one.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm going to legalize it during my
transition, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's silly because they can't do any
of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact that they're saying it is a
monumental change over just the last
[SPEAKER_05]: election.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it was Hillary Trump, neither of them
were vocally discussing legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you said those two names together,
I pictured one giant beast that had
[SPEAKER_04]: united.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, the what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I miss?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hillary Trump?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just four years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And eight years ago, it was something that
people like me were talking about during
[SPEAKER_05]: the election cycle, but it was not
something that candidates were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about during the election cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obama only ever brought it up when he was
fucking forced to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember there was the big pitch that he
did where they were going to put together
[SPEAKER_05]: a website that was fully open and free
form.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people could submit questions and vote
on questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the president was really going to
answer them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they announced that they were
going to do this, the whole country went,
[SPEAKER_05]: presidents don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The White House doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chosen reporter press pool,
they get to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes the powers of the beach used
to answer them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never did they fucking take questions from
the peanut gallery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly not the fucking internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, marijuana was the top
question by miles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer was, haha, fuck off
hippies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got that far in that we got slapped
that hard by someone we all thought was
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be supported.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we literally have the whole field
just openly discussing not just cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization, but psychedelics and other
drug decriminalization, like major drug
[SPEAKER_05]: policy reform.
[SPEAKER_05]: And still we can't get a common sense
marijuana legalization step forward in a
[SPEAKER_05]: place like New York, which is blue as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it don't get much bluer in New York
as far as politics goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis legalization has been a
democratic issue for 20 years now and
[SPEAKER_05]: still zero movement in the legislature
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: The states that have legalization and good
medical rules are almost all passed by a
[SPEAKER_05]: public vote in a place where the public
can force stuff on ballots in places like
[SPEAKER_05]: New York, where it has to go through the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all really need to wrangle your
politicians and get their feet to the
[SPEAKER_05]: fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a white Mike 2028?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one last thing I want from my cannabis
representative, my Mount Cushmore,
[SPEAKER_04]: the king of Mount Cushmore, I guess we're
going to call it is no fucking sponsors,
[SPEAKER_04]: no political interests, no brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if it's green dot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if it's the grow from your
heart podcast or Ivy genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: no sponsors, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to be on their own independent
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to be established.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a lot of enemies fighting for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you, I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, there are a lot of people who
do not like me down here that that own
[SPEAKER_05]: chunks of the industry because I fought
for the people growing in their basements
[SPEAKER_05]: and the people growing in fucking acreage
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people growing in acreage didn't
like that and the fucking people growing
[SPEAKER_05]: in their basements.
[SPEAKER_04]: They liked it, but they minimized all of
that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to learn how to work with what
you're working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not hard to do once you learn how
to adjust.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about being a weird show,
but I liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, uh, I'm not going to blame like
half of this on that fuzzy navel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You went off for a little bit there,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to even go my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just starting to come back to reality
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dad took me places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took the whole audience places.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sat back for 10 or so minutes and just
let you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian was not going to interrupt any of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at nemo punk 15 year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and just so that you know,
since you asked how long it's been 46 and
[SPEAKER_04]: a half minutes and I'm going to cut
probably one minute out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it, uh, I hope y'all liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was part of the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: This time I sat back and tried to listen
instead of talking too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I nodded just to keep you going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it worked well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you did a good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, I would love to see like sometime
2021 cause it would take us a minute to
[SPEAKER_05]: organize.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see us do like a million
stone or March.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've mentioned that on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we, we picked a weekend that wasn't
fucking four 20 and we all went to DC and
[SPEAKER_05]: just blaze down in DC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets legal there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because Congress controls their
budget, they haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_05]: implement the law.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their voters pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one of those really fucked up
American rules where the city of DC gets
[SPEAKER_05]: royally screwed by Congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now they're holding back
legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So being able to go there and do a major
demonstration would be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I know that's totally in contrary to a
lot of what I just said.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody out there in Twitter world can
go, uh, contact Mike and let Mike help
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike organize a million marijuana March.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that already taken?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that something we can use?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if 6 million people want to confirm
on the internet that they're going to go,
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet we could get a full on million there
on the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like area 51, but let's get the
million marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not there to clap your butt cheeks
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know we can fucking roll blunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know we can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Million marijuana March sponsored by white
Mike and the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to sponsor that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just let Mike organize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need organizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need people to help us put that
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Mike, I don't, have you ever been
there to DC?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got, he doesn't know what he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just looked up into space.
[SPEAKER_04]: He definitely needs help.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to remember the age and
honestly don't think that's 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody tweeted, make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys make it happen, I'll go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, you make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be involved in the making
of, but I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Million marijuana March in Washington,
2000 and something that politicians really
[SPEAKER_05]: respond to that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get it big enough, it can't be
like, cause the abortion people do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it for an afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: They march down the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they do some of that every now and
then you really need like more than a
[SPEAKER_05]: million people and you really got to roll
through a city for like a long weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you do that, you scare the hell out
of the people, the powers that be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that, that's like we're supposed to
all be too pacified to show up in mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there's really nothing you can do
about a group that big.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was sort of the point of the big
demonstrations originally, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes complete sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Power and numbers scare them.
[SPEAKER_05]: When a herd runs at you, like your options
are get out of the way or get trampled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join that motherfucking herd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your options.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last note that I wrote down,
Mike, that we should talk about,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just says stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the stupidest shits that I
think is some States are afraid,
[SPEAKER_04]: to legalize cannabis because the stupid
law enforcement can't tell the difference
[SPEAKER_04]: between cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's CBD and what's THC?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's one of my favorite stories of the
year, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so most of the arguments against
legalization are just bad on face value.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like a middle school debate team could
rip the fuck out of the best
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibitionists in the country right now,
just on face merits for an argument.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the ones you see all the time
is that modern pots way stronger than it
[SPEAKER_05]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't your grandfather's weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go back to the eighties in the
seventies, every time the politicians and
[SPEAKER_05]: the DEA have said that and add them all
up, you're talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like five and 6,000% THC,
which if you're not retarded, you know
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can't have something that's more
than a hundred percent anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody's got those seeds, I'll take
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, it's, uh, you see anti-pop
people talking about 70% THC edibles and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like, you think we've, we're eating
gummy bears that are 70% hash and 30%
[SPEAKER_05]: gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just be 70, it would just be the
THC, the molecule with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: gummy bear around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A seventh of a gram of this delicious hash
and I mushed a third of a gram of gummy
[SPEAKER_05]: bear on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you even fucking hear the words
that are coming out of your mouth?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when the story broke,
God, when was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say like November, but it could
have been August.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not have been until January.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Texas was the big one where law
enforcement groups across the state came
[SPEAKER_05]: out together and said, because of the,
the federal hemp bill making hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, or, or cannabis sativa with less than
0.03% THC in it per volume is now legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, they have no way to tell if you've got
a quarter of like fire nugs in your
[SPEAKER_05]: pocket, or if you've got a quarter of
ditch weed in your pocket, the cops can't
[SPEAKER_05]: tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can smell it and they can call it
green leaf and material and they can send
[SPEAKER_05]: it to a lab who after several months will
send a report back to the cops.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, yes, is weed or no is not weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the report they get back because
that's the only testing equipment they've
[SPEAKER_05]: ever bothered to apply.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so not only does it give lie to the,
this weeds way stronger than last week's
[SPEAKER_05]: weed, because they never fucking tested to
see how strong it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: They never bothered.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just heard Dr. Dre was dropping a new
album called the chronic and that must
[SPEAKER_05]: mean it's super strong weed now and it's
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hydro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, we could play this game all night.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, whatever new slang term that we
threw on top of the product, it became
[SPEAKER_05]: like the fucking anti-pop people really
think Girl Scout cookies tastes like Girl
[SPEAKER_05]: Scout cookies because we added chemical
agent flavoring to the plant or
[SPEAKER_05]: manipulated its genetics to make it taste
like peppermint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you see stories like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cops can't really test the potency of
your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they have no idea if that's a
tractor trailer full of hemp or a tractor
[SPEAKER_05]: trailer full of Colombian bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous that they can rely on that
archaic testing to put people in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's absolutely insane and
it's, it's seeing them admit it now is
[SPEAKER_05]: just really aggravating because that
whole, this weeds a lot stronger than it
[SPEAKER_05]: used to be bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's like their favorite card in
the deck right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of different groups
around the country that are trying to get
[SPEAKER_05]: bills passed and legal marijuana states
that limit potency to like 10 or 15%
[SPEAKER_05]: inflow or and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, we just had a bunch of
vaping deaths that looked like they're
[SPEAKER_05]: either tied to an additive in the hash or
something in the pan that's being used to
[SPEAKER_05]: heat the hash up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's either a contaminant or a
consumption method problem, not a THC
[SPEAKER_05]: problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their answer, their new idea is to
dilute that shit further with more cutting
[SPEAKER_05]: agents.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a medical marijuana consumer,
I like the concentrates with 70 to 80% THC
[SPEAKER_04]: because I can take one fat inhale and one
good exhale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've consumed the amount of medicine I
need for an hour, maybe an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_04]: ish and I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that were 10% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're talking about three joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're going to cut it,
if you're going to make, this is a 70%
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it say on the back?
[SPEAKER_04]: 63.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd take six dabs if this were 10%
concentrated, take six dabs to get to the
[SPEAKER_04]: same spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: My lungs don't need six dabs going through
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like part of the reason why I moved
on to concentrates, less in an exhale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so if I'm a sick person,
like if I was actually older and in worse
[SPEAKER_04]: health, I wouldn't want to have to take
six dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one to get my medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just a, and I'm going to take
six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I have to, if I'm only getting 10,
I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's not a logical reason that
they're doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's all designed to cripple.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry, that's the only,
their only goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ignorance and fear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's a seriously a huge group
of people in this country that they grew
[SPEAKER_05]: up really buying into the drugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drug users are bad people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have poor morals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have low character and the way that
you show other people in your society that
[SPEAKER_05]: you were a high, or a person with good
morals and strong characters, strong
[SPEAKER_05]: values and character.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't do drugs and you hate drug users
and you talk shit about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like half the fucking country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they look at the other half of the
country, pushing for legalization,
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't understand any of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That they just, they can't wrap their
heads around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they really are convinced that if we
let marijuana be legal, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: make it mandatory for middle schoolers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go so far as to like deny the
existence of the black market altogether.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you talk to the local anti-pop people
like smart Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a well-known group.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're quoted by the press every week.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're reported on nationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they've got a THC cap potency
bill that's going to work its way through
[SPEAKER_05]: the legislature and get killed early in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're inspiring the same moves in
other States.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pushing States that are urging,
are looking like they're going to legalize
[SPEAKER_05]: to add rules like that at the jump.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that like if Kentucky really does pass
the medical marijuana stuff that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, the anti-pop people pushing
it to include shit like a 10% THC cap and
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates and a ban on edibles and,
you know, all the sort of nightmare rules
[SPEAKER_05]: that we would just not at all accept here,
but they're thinking they can sneak them
[SPEAKER_05]: in upfront there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're getting away with it because a
bunch of the country just doesn't care
[SPEAKER_05]: enough to fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to say that they believe
something that's completely ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost the train of your thought also,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to keep up with you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't ran for too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's late.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is late.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually the third podcast I've
done today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did another episode of my own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was on the embracing organic
show for over two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start wrapping this up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm past my dadly bedtime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's train of thought has left the
fucking station.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm catching up with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the story Jeff brought up is the THC
potency thing is, is a really good story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I keep coming back to it because it's
one of those fun stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it gives away to a lie that
authority figures have been telling for
[SPEAKER_05]: decades and not just one, but several.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but not enough people pay attention to
all the moving parts to follow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many smoke and mirror tricks
happening now that it's hard to keep up
[SPEAKER_04]: with every and anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see law enforcement officials in the
same, the same article bitching about how
[SPEAKER_05]: they can't test for the difference between
hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then insisting that they can't
legalize because today's marijuana is so
[SPEAKER_05]: much more potent than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just a joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which machine did you not use,
sir?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're, what they're doing is
they're comparing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so what the, what local police
departments would do if they felt like it
[SPEAKER_05]: is they could send portions of the seizure
to the DEA lab and the DEA lab can test
[SPEAKER_05]: for potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way that works is like I get
pulled over on January 1st, the cops says
[SPEAKER_05]: I smell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go through that whole rigmarole and my
bag of weed ends up in evidence six
[SPEAKER_05]: months, eight months, 20 months later,
I go through court.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and a gram of that gets sent off maybe
two months before the trial date,
[SPEAKER_05]: three months before the trial date gets
sent off to the DEA lab and comes back
[SPEAKER_05]: with a, it's 12% THC or it's 4% THC or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, because by then it's been sitting in
evidence and God only knows what condition
[SPEAKER_05]: for God only knows how long and it's
rotted, molded, been crushed.
[SPEAKER_05]: THC degrades over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what happened to that THC and
there it might've been warm, might've been
[SPEAKER_04]: cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it under a bright light?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it in front of a window?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it sealed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it open?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it in a paper bag, a plastic bag?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so the DEA has been testing years,
months old products and then calling that
[SPEAKER_05]: what people are consuming and pretending
that's a legit number.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the further you go back in time,
the weaker the numbers get and the slower
[SPEAKER_05]: that process gets is like all of a sudden
somebody in East Brownsville, Texas,
[SPEAKER_05]: that does a big pop bust and sends a
couple grams off to the DEA lab at the end
[SPEAKER_05]: of the bus just to, you know, for record
keeping, cause they don't do anything with
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The charge isn't stronger or a higher
degree felony if it's stronger weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of that shit matters.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does now and not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, all the charges are based on the
poundage or the ounces depending on what
[SPEAKER_05]: drug you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, Mike's losing his train of
thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's high as shit over here and it's high
and I'm tired guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's close to one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, let's just wrap it up so you don't
quit teasing everybody with more trains of
[SPEAKER_04]: thoughts that get lost and that don't
leave the station completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trains have to make it to the second
station or people are missing,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so they send this shit off to the DEA
lab slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just takes a lot of time and they're
comparing that number with what's on weed
[SPEAKER_05]: maps is the local dispensary's menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the two numbers they're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something you grew versus something I
grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because it wasn't until,
it wasn't until the legal modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry that a majority of the product
that people were actually consuming was
[SPEAKER_05]: getting lab tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck, it took me a long to get there,
but I got there folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's give Mike a prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get another dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: He looked at my rig like, I'm not sure I
fucking want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
