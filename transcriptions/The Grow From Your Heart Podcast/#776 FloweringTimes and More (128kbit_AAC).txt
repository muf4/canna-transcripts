the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends to support the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of support, let's send a big
shout out to everybody in Colorado who
[SPEAKER_00]: voted to support the legalization of
medical mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, here in the state of
Colorado, we recently had an election and
[SPEAKER_00]: we did pass the legalization of medical
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that is a huge step
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that if medicine works for you,
you should be able to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a big proponent, obviously a big
supporter of medical cannabis and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: also a big supporter of the medical
mushroom movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, like I said, if something helps
you improve the quality of your life,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your mental state is improved,
if your physical state is improved,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be able to consume what we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it doesn't improve our state,
we should be able to do what we like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with and to our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the freedom that I feel we should
be given.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do support this legalization of
medical mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to the entire state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who voted for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely voted for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know several people who are on Team
Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up, proud of you, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this can be taken as a very
serious change in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the medical marijuana movement
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how dispensaries popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we started the cannabis
movement in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had a lot of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led to people that didn't have
medical marijuana seeing dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, why can't I shop there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we passed recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got legal adult use cannabis
where everybody 21 and over can walk into
[SPEAKER_00]: a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got the proper ID, they can buy
legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same thing that is happening
with medical mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon, if we shape the laws
correctly, there will be stores where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go and you can buy your legal medical
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been growing, cultivating,
spreading mushroom magic since before
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, this could be the time for
you to take control of a brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: business opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could possibly open a mushroom
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the medical marijuana movement
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be no different with medical
mushrooms, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people look up to those few
people who started the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: movement here who are well known for
growing making concentrates, just being
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at those people like pioneers,
you can be that in the mushroom movement
[SPEAKER_00]: if you take the initiative to do that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a business minded person,
if you are a mushroom cultivator,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've been a mushroom, mushroom
magician, if you've been a mushroom shaman
[SPEAKER_00]: for several years, there are a few of my
friends that your faces are popping into
[SPEAKER_00]: my mind right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who I'm talking to, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already cultivating mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get you a building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set you up a fully legal mushroom
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, let's figure out how legal that
is, how you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ahead of the game and let's get that
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't get it going,
eventually some corporation or some big
[SPEAKER_00]: time company will come in and they will
take over your spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want some company coming in that
doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got money and they've got the
ability to buy a building and produce
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms and sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd prefer somebody with some experience
and some passion in it, just like we
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now is the opportunity,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the bottom line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Colorado for passing the medical
mushroom initiative there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you guys, if this is your your
spot in the world, this may be your time
[SPEAKER_00]: to shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that medical mushroom dispensary
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, once you get it going,
reach out, I would love to trade some
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising for some store credit if you
know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, big up to the mushroom gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to everybody who voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I try not to get too political on
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's not here to talk about politics
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to talk about politics,
but big up to everybody who voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are obviously making change because we
did legalize mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have something else I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one person who watches and
listens to this podcast who sends me
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of emails and they question every
single thing that I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They doubt all of my techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: They doubt all of my methods, but then
they grow using a lot of my techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every podcast I put out, I get
feedback about how one thing I said could
[SPEAKER_00]: have been wrong, how it would have been
better if I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys question everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the only cannabis grower on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the only breeder on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the only podcaster on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the only one with ideas and
standard operating procedures of how this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant could and can be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm completely wrong with what you
need from a cannabis plant or your
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say something, I'm speaking what
works for me and what has been proven to
[SPEAKER_00]: work in a commercial environment and
several other private and personal
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take everything I say as suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you question things that I say,
that is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should question everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should never trust anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always double check me,
reference me, cross check me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that what I'm saying applies to
the project you were working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that there's somebody out there
who's questioning everything that I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me on my toes and it reminds me
that the things I'm teaching, maybe I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: do this to your plant on one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll read a totally different message
and I'll say, do not do this to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll just be situational,
but maybe in a different situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be totally different advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take everything I say situationally and
take it all as a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, I am not the wizard of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the grow guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of experience in different
types of environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in garages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in shacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in any type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine a beautiful warehouse,
a filthy warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done grows indoors and outdoors in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me think that I know how to
do a lot of things, but I may not know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do exactly what you need done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some ideas, do some research and
definitely cross reference and double
[SPEAKER_00]: check because I'm not the only one out
here teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ideas and ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I do it is the way that I do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you do it may be totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it another guy does it could be
totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we are all having a safe,
effective, satisfying harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do it wrong is when you are
contaminating product, poisoning patients
[SPEAKER_00]: or killing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're questioning what I'm teaching
you, that is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't believe anything anybody says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, double check me cross check
me, check some references, listen to other
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts, read some other books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, before you even listen to my
podcast, I would highly recommend that you
[SPEAKER_00]: read a few basic grow books.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people send me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see crazy questions on social media and
I honestly think that many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: questions could have been answered if
somebody just bought a basic grow book
[SPEAKER_00]: from your favorite grow author.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes,
Greg Green, Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of people out there that
write great cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the basics or go to a website that
teaches you the basics so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the basics then listen to these
podcasts, then read more books,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to more podcasts, expand your
knowledge, double check everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: cross reference it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am not offended that you question
everything that I say, that you doubt some
[SPEAKER_00]: of my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Challenge me, challenge yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing that people challenge
me on is the 18-6 increasing bud density
[SPEAKER_00]: and speeding up flowering time at the end
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that at the end of flower for
the past, for the last 10 to 14 days of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, I turn my lights back to 18 on and
six hours off because I believe it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants finish a little more quickly and
they get a little more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like they're, they get
chunkier and fatter and there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: weight and more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that that is
completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who really doesn't think it's
crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who have tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all report back with great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people who have negative feedback
and negative ideas are the people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: not tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So question me, doubt me, but then go try
the shit that I wrote and see if it works
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may kill a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also realize that you just learned
a super amazing technique that will
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your grow and increase the amount
of harvest you're going to get this time
[SPEAKER_00]: and every harvest from here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please do question me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not some grow guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of experience and I've got
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sleep very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of just playing video games or
doing something weird, I read the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scroll around and figure out how to grow
weed better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got really good at producing
cannabis is I just have insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of wasting that time, I do a lot
of reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I read, I apply what I
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read a lot of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read how to do a lot of things,
but until you put your hands in the dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: get some scissors in your hand,
pull on some leaves, smell those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the experience
from the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in there, but read those
books, then get in there and grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm, that's why I know a lot of
stuff because I've read the books and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went and did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky enough to build my own
personal grow way early on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization movement, possibly before
that, but we won't talk too much about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got lucky enough to be involved
in several commercial facilities and I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned a lot in every one of those
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm friends with a lot of great
growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a lot of input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionately curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I care about a subject, I will absorb
all of the info that I can as quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I've done with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of feel like it's my job to
feed that information to you guys in an
[SPEAKER_00]: understandable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take in a lot of things and then I try
to filter it and put it back out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way that all of you listening learn in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to teach each and every one of
you in a way that you can be entertained
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn the thing I'm trying to teach
without getting bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I did not like listening in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell by my rambles here,
I've got ADD and I don't like to stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: one subject for very long unless I'm super
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously cannabis keeps me interested
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cause I teach one way doesn't mean
that's the only way to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double check me, cross reference me and be
flexible you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said a minute ago, there's no
wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only wrong way to do it is it like I
said, if you're poisoning somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you burn down the grow, if you kill all
the plants, shit like that is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with your harvest,
you can do everything completely
[SPEAKER_00]: differently than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in soilless mix and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may do it in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already going way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both gonna have successful outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both on the same team and that is
what counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I rambled for way too long on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward into the next topic
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently popped into a chat room and
they were having a heated debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topic of that debate was when is day
one of flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to keep track of how long our
plants have been in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have a mark of when day one
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you know how long you've been
going, how long to anticipate before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are arguing when is day
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one is the day that you turn your
timer from 18-6 or 24 or whatever it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one is the day you change that timer
to a shorter day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first short day is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't wait until you see pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't wait until something else
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why make it an algebra problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already got the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed the light from 18-6 to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Thursday, November 10th, that is day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will forever be day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the solid day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder is right on the seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long we think those seeds should
probably take and I am putting those
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers on the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one making the packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making the labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that those seeds are going to take
approximately 70 days from the day that
[SPEAKER_00]: you change the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't change the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't wait to see something happen,
then start counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling that an algebra problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not flower time plus two minus two
weeks minus five days plus the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's from fucking, like I said,
November 10th is day one because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when we change the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my seed packages, you will see stuff
like nine to 10 weeks flowering time,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 12 weeks flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that stuff on there because I have
determined that that is how long those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds take in the average grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown those seeds myself,
grown them plenty of times to see how long
[SPEAKER_00]: they take in my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I sent those seeds out to friends,
to testers and they grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send me test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send me test reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell me how long it took those plants
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I compile all of that data and I do an
average basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it's about 70 days for
the stuff that I breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some stuff come a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some stuff a little bit longer,
but I do include that on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say these plants finish in nine to 10
weeks, that means out of the hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: tester packs I sent, probably 70 to 80% of
them finished in the timeframe I printed
[SPEAKER_00]: on that package.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will always be outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those outliers may finish earlier than the
time I recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those outliers also could take longer than
the time I recommended on the package,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that number I put on the package is
ideally the amount of time it should take
[SPEAKER_00]: for those plants to finish in most
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have extreme cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have extreme dry or humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may over or under water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may over or under feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what could go on in your
room, but in most cases, the time I put on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of that package is fairly
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say those seeds are going to
take approximately nine to 10 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that when I grew them,
most of my phenotypes took nine to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my testers grew them, most of them
took nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of reports and I just compile
that data together and I really pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to what people tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I make all of the descriptions
and reports based on what I saw and based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what all of the test growers saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I try to compile and convey that
information to you in a useful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put that data on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to make sure it's on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do try my best to get all of that
accurate data to you because I know how
[SPEAKER_00]: critical and crucial that is in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does really help to have a good idea of
how long it is going to take for these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or plants to finish in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me add on to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying the plants may take nine to
10 weeks or eight to nine weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something very important
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm saying nine weeks, I mean they
will take nine full weeks to finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: not let eight weeks happen and then cut it
down at the start of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let nine weeks finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I said nine weeks, that is 63 full
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that ninth week to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put in that last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut it down a full week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I'm going to breed and sell
to you is going to take about 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're letting it go at least
nine, maybe even 10, maybe 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real way to tell when that plant
is done is to have a scope, maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: magnifying glass that hooks up to your
computer, some way to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need at least a 60, maybe a 100 X
scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are starting to get amber in
color is when it is time to harvest your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at a couple of different spots at the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look kind of lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tops are going to be more done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middles won't be done as much and the
bottoms are not nearly as finished on some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, depending on the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you got large plants, they'll
finish at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go from clear to like a
silvery blue to milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll start turning amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: When 20 to 30 percent of those trichomes
look like you dipped them in Dr. Pepper,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when it is time to cut down that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would look on several different
locations of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look kind of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around the main top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around the secondaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the lowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what color the trichomes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't stress too much on the exact
day when you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a harvest window.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to say it's a harvest window of
peak ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be right at one day,
one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of days of a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really overthink and they
stress way too hard on when to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you've got 20 to 30 percent of
that amber trichomes going on on your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, you will have a quality harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend letting that first batch go
probably 10, maybe 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay really close attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay really close attention to the health
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't recommend doing the 18-6 on
the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that on runs after you've
learned the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to see how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to learn when to start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to learn when to flip the light
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to learn the details of this plant
before we start doing too many tricks to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this first run, let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe next time, let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go too long the first time,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a good first date so you can learn
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, the third, the fourth date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when things will really start
getting hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a relationship with your plants,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people want to grow new shit
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get new flavors, new aromas,
a new buzz every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you pick one or two plants and you
grow the shit out of them for four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles, you'll learn that like around week
three, if I defoliate this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really starts chunking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around week six, if I give this one a
whole bunch of bud swell, it really takes
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I let this one go 11 weeks,
it really finishes super fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start learning things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn if I give it a little more
Kalmag or if I cut out the Kalmag or give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a little bit of this or that at a
certain time, it really goes shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start paying attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get each cultivar perfected before you add
too many more to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my rant on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody else tell you otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the one who puts the numbers on the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how long they should take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow that number that I put on my
package of my seeds that you bought from
[SPEAKER_00]: me because you trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
