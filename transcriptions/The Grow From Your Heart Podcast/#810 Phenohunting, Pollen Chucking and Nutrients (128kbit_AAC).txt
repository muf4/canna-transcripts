[SPEAKER_01]: So keep it locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grow From Your Heart podcast starts
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 810 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I've got a great show lined up
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to give away
free iREGENETX premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the question and
answer portion of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from my friend Anthony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did come from the Grow Help tab on the
iREGENETX website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the iREGENETX website at iregenetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tab on the top that says Grow
Help or Grow Questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Anthony and it goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, in phenohunting,
is it best to naturally see how the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: develop simultaneously?
[SPEAKER_00]: Organically mixed out with other stresses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it best to push them to their
fullest potential with salt and stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize their capabilities or both and or
why?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of question in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to think about in that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me break this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start from the beginning
and answer this step by step and talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's very fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In phenohunting, what's a phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we get an amount of seeds,
a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere in between there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we are running a population
of seeds and looking for the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is most desirable for our situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a commercial grow,
if you've got a home grow, if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: big space, a small space, indoors,
outdoors, your phenotype selection may be
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want the one that tastes a lot
like strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want the one that tastes a lot
like mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want the one that grows taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want the one that grew real wide
and short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your phenotypical selection that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variation that you will see amongst
the pack will vary based on the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing something like an F1,
you may see a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing an F2, you'll see a lot
more within the F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may start tapering off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be even more wild, depending on
what the breeder did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is going to be a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running a pack of seeds and
looking for the specific plant within that
[SPEAKER_00]: package, within that population to meet
your needs, a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find the phenotype for my garden,
for my specific needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: When phenohunting, is it best to naturally
see how the plants develop simultaneously,
[SPEAKER_00]: organically maxed out with other stresses,
or best to push them to their fullest
[SPEAKER_00]: potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running a phenohunt, if I'm looking
for a specific phenotype, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably run all of these seeds
exactly the same on their first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got just a basic nutrient mix,
a small little tester grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put all of the seedlings in that
run in that first little room,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like the casting couch,
the auditioning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I put them into a great big room
and see what they do, I do a small
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt in a small room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would run everybody in the same
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can see what they do under just
normal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you normally grow organics,
grow them organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you normally grow with bottled
nutrients, grow them with bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you normally do it hydroponically,
do it hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your regular routine is to do it in
cocoa with perlite and new millennium
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and a gravity-fed drip system,
do that because that's what we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the plant that works the best in the
system, which we are working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to find the plant that's going
to perform in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not run it, run it in the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run them all the same in a very basic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will make my phenotype selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once I've made that selection,
I will grow it a couple of times in very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar conditions and take a look at a
lot of notes, and then I will start
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting it based on what I see could be
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need less of something,
of anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I push something a little bit harder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would something make it a little bit
happier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I start noticing that right at week
six, it really starts to beef up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe at week five, I could start
feeding it a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I could beef it up a little bit
heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I noticed that if I overfeed it at
week seven, it starts to turn yellow and
[SPEAKER_00]: stops eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll stop overfeeding it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn that plant and then adjust to that
after you've found your phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying in phenohunting,
is it best to naturally see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: develop simultaneously?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do the same thing to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say organically maxed out with
other stresses or best to push them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't push them very super hard
until I actually have made a phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of run just a basic mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a real good new millennium
balanced mix that I know works for just
[SPEAKER_00]: about every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will run all of the plants in that under
the basic lighting system that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes my basic lighting system
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I've got different ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it changes seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, of course, I hang up an HBS
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put a heater in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put up an HBS and add a few more
plants under that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, it's way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't run that thing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It roasts the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the HBS just comes down in the
summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a few adjustments like that,
but I really don't change a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I do what I'm going to do to them
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I plan on topping them, if I plan on
lollipopping them, if I'm going to spread
[SPEAKER_00]: them out, if I'm going to scrog them,
if I'm going to just see if green them,
[SPEAKER_00]: as little tiny plants, I do that to the
whole run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's going to be my plan for the
future for these plants, then that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do in the starter run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to know what I'm going to
get when I put this plant in the big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be able to handle my basic
nutrient feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can work from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can take my basic, just my basic
feed, my basic nutrition, I know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: boost it from there and make it even
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can handle my pesticide regimen,
if it can handle my lighting schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it can handle being lollipopped way far
up the way that I like to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have a lot of the little sucker
branches taken off and a lot of popping
[SPEAKER_00]: and twisting and bending it over and
putting it into a scrog, can it handle
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the phenotype, the phenohunt that I
am going to give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it can handle all of that stuff,
I need to find that out in the first run
[SPEAKER_00]: before I go put it into a bigger room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I'm trying to say is run
the phenohunt just like you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: run your main run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to top it, top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to scrog it out,
scrog it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can find the plant that works
the best in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that is if you've got time,
space, room, all of the necessities to run
[SPEAKER_00]: a big phenohunt and do all of those things
to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, we may get the phrase
phenohunt and testers mixed up because I
[SPEAKER_00]: do them differently, but sometimes it
happens very similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll be doing a test run and
find a phenotype that is fucking magical
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes they look similar,
but they are actually different projects
[SPEAKER_00]: with different goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: A test batch, I'm just seeing what we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I hit my goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we create with a phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that those have been narrowed down
to where they're going to be acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we just have to find the one that
works the best for our needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I can do that by running a
small plant and finding something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like, but it is much better and I do
recommend to manipulate it however you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to manipulate that plant in your big
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I would say train how you're going
to go to battle or practice with the
[SPEAKER_00]: drumsticks you're going to play with at
the gig as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy Anthony, he does wrap
it up with a couple of other things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of some private stuff to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, thank you for keeping me
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wraps it up with the word peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, Anthony, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do realize you come from prohibition
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any more questions,
please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you would like a free pack of
seeds or a free t-shirt, please do send me
[SPEAKER_00]: your shipping information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a t-shirt, let me know what
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand you're in prohibition land
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to rock the t-shirts
with pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe better if I send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which one you would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get you taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a good flow going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the next message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this one also did come from the
grow help tab at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend,
New York Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all of our friends out there
in New York, enjoying and supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a lot of things are taking off
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there to make a lot of
cool things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a general grow question and it
says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm chilling out doing a podcast with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching, listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching out there on YouTube,
please do click like on the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also click that subscribe button.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just takes you a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does help me out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the opportunity for the
shameless advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just want to start off by
saying thank you for all that you do for
[SPEAKER_00]: the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently running Sunkiss for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in late veg and I will be... All
right, let me back up because I just
[SPEAKER_00]: glazed right over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all I do for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great compliments,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the words of encouragement
and the positive influence and the words
[SPEAKER_00]: of affirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those do go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that I'm putting
in some work for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, I am currently
running Sunkiss for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am late in veg and I will be
flipping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, when would the best time
be to start implementing the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I shouldn't start them until they
have been flipped, but about how many
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after the flip?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read so many different answers on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the internet is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what inspired this podcast
is I would read all of the crazy answers
[SPEAKER_00]: that people gave you for this simple
question and my head would explode and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to bash my head against the
wall and drive my car to each one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: people's houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ask them why they wrote what they
wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, it just drove me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I tried to filter out all the
bullshit for you and give you solid
[SPEAKER_00]: answers is what inspired me to do this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate any insight you may have and
maybe any tips you might have for my first
[SPEAKER_00]: run with Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks in advance from New York green,
stay ire bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always ire forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re can't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, tips for Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you guys, there are 800 episodes of
the grow from your heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those episodes is titled Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you search the word Sunkiss and grow
from your heart podcast on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will bring up a full, uh, somewhere
between 30 and 40 minute episode all about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will tell you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend checking out that podcast,
not just to blow you off, but I already
[SPEAKER_00]: did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like a lot of people,
uh, don't realize there are a lot of old
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, go check out the back catalog
while you're here, while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, go see some of the older stuff that we
put out a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've been doing this for 800
episodes, quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out that, but there's an old
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question, when would you start
implementing flowering nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are a couple of options for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start, uh, day one, the day that
you flip that plant into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could just set that veg bottle right
over there and bring that flowering bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: over, start using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now officially in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were using your flowering nutrients or
you could grab it and gradually taper it
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, uh, phase out that,
uh, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're feeding, I don't know how
much, I don't know the amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would say a hundred, cause it's
easier to keep track.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeding a hundred mills while
you're in veg, maybe drop it to 50 mills
[SPEAKER_00]: and 50 milliliters of your veg and 50
milliliters of bloom for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cut out that veg and go a hundred
percent all the way onto the bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or you could phase it out as long or
slowly as you would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend over the first two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go longer than two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as long as you need to taper that
process off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some strains, some cultivars do need a
little bit more nitrogen to get them all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way through the flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a bad idea to keep that,
uh, vegetative nutrient going,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little bit more nitrogen into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants, however, some OG Kush type
cultivars, uh, dog walker, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically does not like too much
nitrogen a little bit early into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to cut that one out a little bit
earlier, but that's just some strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: dog walker, some of the Kushier type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just won't let it stack up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it does what I call the stairway
or the spiral staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your buds should stack and then stack and
then just stack up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it'll make just a little
rock nugget and then right around the pole
[SPEAKER_00]: of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make a little another one and then
right around the pole and make another
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like spiral up the stick,
uh, up the stock of the plant instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: making a big bud like it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be from overfeeding nitrogen,
uh, too much into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you fade out, phase out that
nitrogen within the first two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing something from my
lineup, a Golda goat cross and a rise
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, maybe even the afterglow crosses,
I would recommend possibly keeping some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that nitrogen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the first week of the flowering
phase while you're feeding, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I make are super hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are hyper vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do eat a lot and they do go nine to
10, maybe even a little bit longer than 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those plants may need that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is going to eat most of the
nitrogen, uh, early on in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase and it's going to store it up in the
vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to get that in there early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it starts fading, once the nitrogen
is too low, it's hard to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling it chasing is what we call
it when you can't get enough nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a look at my notes,
uh, see what else we could tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would, you can either just cut it
off right at day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you flip the light, uh, to 12,
12, that is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also flip to your flowering
nutrients or you can take up to two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and slowly gradually, uh, replace them as
you feel necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the option to either just cut
it off at day one, or like I keep saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can taper it off over a week or a two
week process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the taper off, just make sure
that you're doing like whatever percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of one and the percentage of the other
bottle and work from a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: this way to a hundred percent this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the sliding scale, do the math as long
as it takes as much percentage as it does
[SPEAKER_00]: take you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just go in quarters, replace it,
go like 25% flowering nudes, 50% 75,
[SPEAKER_00]: then a hundred percent flowering nudes
over the course of a week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get you there beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've rambled on enough about this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, New York green, since I read
your question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: that does mean that you win a free pack
of, I read genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your address so I can
send you a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do send me that shipping address,
please include a real name that I can put
[SPEAKER_00]: on the box or at least a, a legit looking
name I can put on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put New York green on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what I'm using for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there wins free seeds
from me, please do put a real name in the
[SPEAKER_00]: email so that I can send you your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not have to send it to weed smoker
5,000 and ganja farmer 4 20 just makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to the post office and the lady
scans the box and looks at it and goes
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja farmer 4 20, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sets it down and scans the next
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoner Dave, 5,000, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sets it down and like she sees a theme and
I don't want them to get any ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just send a real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's no need to kill the momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the party moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great message here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the grow house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help tab on the I read genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a person called
pineapple long tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to pineapple long tooth for
the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a breathing question this time
and it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm a long time
listener and I owe parts of my growing
[SPEAKER_00]: success to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't owe me anything, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are even now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all you gotta do is grow the best you
can make me proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm now looking to do some
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm glad I've inspired you to do some
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have identified which male I
want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now curious on when to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part of the question is would you
suggest flipping the male and the females
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time or would you stagger the
flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very long drawn out answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I would like to chop the male down
after he drops pollen and I have collected
[SPEAKER_00]: some as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there another time I should pollinate
the females again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all your help and work with
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your information has helped so many and I
consistently re listen to shows for the
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pal pineapple long tooth pineapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great message, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're listening to the podcast
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you were breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's answer some of these breeding
specific questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part of the question is would I
stagger the flowering of the male and the
females?
[SPEAKER_00]: They will work perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put the male and females in the
room all at the same time, guess what will
[SPEAKER_00]: happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You will make a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference will be you could make
a lot more seed if you time it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I stress on timing it
differently is because I make seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make as many as I can because of
course I want to get them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making seeds for yourself,
you will make plenty of seeds if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw them all in there at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about your options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do want to stagger them,
I would get the male pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want him making a big fat cloud of
pollen when your female plants have big
[SPEAKER_00]: fat ripe pistils, those dandelion looking
flowery things popping up on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what's going to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want as much of that as possible on
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them as healthy as possible on
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could happen anywhere between
somewhere around approximately day 23 to
[SPEAKER_00]: day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say day 23 to day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just depends on the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two plants that I like to use as
examples in this occurrence quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a strawberry fields plant which
makes strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes the red pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also made Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a few other things coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Jack the Ripper across to the
strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also I've got the platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes the sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that came from the
platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Michelangelo came from that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awesome amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both make a lot of great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both make a lot of great crosses,
but I have to time them completely
[SPEAKER_00]: differently in the breeding room if I want
to maximize their seed potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy plant will accept
pollen much earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put the platinum tangy plant into
flower, I only have to wait three,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three and a half weeks before I
pollinate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberry fields plant, that plant
needs at least four, maybe five weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's fully ready for pollen and
then they create the same amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have learned to put that
strawberry fields plant into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room a week, 10 days, maybe two weeks
ahead of the platinum tangy plant if I
[SPEAKER_00]: want them both to receive pollen at the
ideal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I would start flowering the male
plant just a little bit early,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a week or 10 days earlier than
everybody else if you can keep him away
[SPEAKER_00]: from everybody, if you can keep him from
pollinating everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that pollen going in there so he's
building up a big load of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when all the females are ready,
I would take him in there if you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: take the top in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what your situation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the top off that plant, get that
plant, get it in there and pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take off the top, leave the rest of
the plant, let it build up more pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: chop down the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked another part, should I pollinate
a second time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, five to 10 days later pollinate
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait too long, maybe five to seven
days later pollinate again, about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally do it a week apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the plant can build up more
pollen, a few more pistols or what didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get pollinated will receive some more
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and smack it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wait until your female plants are all
ready for the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your male plant in there, give them a
good shake, get that pollen in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them if you need to, get parts of the
pollen moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you need to do to fully
pollinate that room, get all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: females, get every pistol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that male plant build up another load
for about seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at this point you can cut him down
and carry him and touch each plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: him and get that pollen everywhere you're
going to make a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now clean up the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the worst part of pollen is that
it's booking everywhere and it tastes like
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and it sucks to clean up,
but that is a breeder of life so do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've got everything cleaned
up, you've done your second pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you can decide if you want to
run those lights on your regular 1212 or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to do research and watch my 18
six after pollination video where I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about changing the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me check in on this,
see if I've covered all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When to pollinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pollinate when the pistols are the
ripest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to depend on a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivar, the room, the environment,
the feed, the lights, the VPD will make a
[SPEAKER_00]: big difference on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you've sprayed them, try not to spray
anything if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you suggest flipping the male and
females at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a perfect world,
I would flip the male seven to ten days
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead, maybe two weeks ahead of everybody,
then start flipping the females as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they go into the room with their
flowering routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you stagger the flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if you can, but if not, it's all
going to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to make breeding too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in there and let them fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids have babies all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have babies all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals have babies all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature wants babies to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creation is all of the world's whole
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything just wants to breed and make
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those plants in there and don't watch
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them have some dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do the thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more though, it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to chop down the male after
I've collected some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I've done a pollen collection
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there another time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, about a week after the first
pollination.
